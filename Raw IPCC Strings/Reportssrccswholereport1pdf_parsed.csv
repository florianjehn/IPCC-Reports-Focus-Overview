in Paris, France, the IPCC endorsed this proposal and agreed
on the outline and timetable’. Working Group III was charged
to assess the scientific, technical, environmental, economic,

mandate of the report therefore included the assessment of the
technological maturity, the technical and economic potential
to contribute to mitigation of climate change, and the costs. It
also included legal and regulatory issues, public perception,

process consisting of the separation of CO, from industrial
and energy-related sources, transport to a storage location
and long-term isolation from the atmosphere. This report
considers CCS as an option in the portfolio of mitigation
actions for stabilization of atmospheric greenhouse gas
concentrations.

"Most scenarios project that the supply of primary energy
will continue to be dominated by fossil fuels until at least
the middle of the century. As discussed in the TAR, most
models also indicate that known technological options! could
achieve a broad range of atmospheric stabilization levels
but that implementation would require socio-economic and
institutional changes. In this context, the availability of
CCS in the portfolio of options could facilitate achieving
stabilization goals (Sections 1.1, 1.3).

Large point sources of CO, include large fossil fuel or
biomass energy facilities, major CO,-emitting industries,
natural gas production, synthetic fuel plants and fossil
fuel-based hydrogen production plants (see Table SPM.1).
Potential technical storage methods are: geological storage (in
geological formations, such as oil and gas fields, unminable
coal beds and deep saline formations), ocean storage (direct
release into the ocean water column or onto the deep seafloor)
and industrial fixation of CO, into inorganic carbonates.
This report also discusses industrial uses of CO,, but this
is not expected to contribute much to the reduction of CO,

"Other mitigation options include energy efficiency
improvements, the switch to less carbon-intensive fuels,
nuclear power, renewable energy sources, enhancement of
biological sinks, and reduction of non-CO, greenhouse gas
emissions. CCS has the potential to reduce overall mitigation
costs and increase flexibility in achieving greenhouse gas
emission reductions. The widespread application of CCS
would depend on technical maturity, costs, overall potential,
diffusion and transfer of the technology to developing
countries and their capacity to apply the technology, regulatory
aspects, environmental issues and public perception (Sections
1.1.1, 1.3, 1.7, 8.3.3.4).

explained in the TAR and several mitigation scenarios include CCS

2 Storage of CO, as mineral carbonates does not cover deep geological carbonation or ocean storage with enhanced carbonate neutralization as discussed in
Chapter 6 (Section 7.2).

3 Saline formations are sedimentary rocks saturated with formation waters containing high concentrations of dissolved salts. They are widespread and contain
enormous quantities of water that are unsuitable for agriculture or human consumption. Because the use of geothermal energy is likely to increase, potential

geothermal areas may not be suitable for CO, storage (see Section 5.3.3).

equivalent output without CCS, of which most is for capture
and compression. For secure storage, the net result is that a
power plant with CCS could reduce CO, emissions to the
atmosphere by approximately 80-90% compared to a plant
without CCS (see Figure SPM.2). To the extent that leakage
might occur from a storage reservoir, the fraction retained is
defined as the fraction of the cumulative amount of injected
CO, that is retained over a specified period of time. CCS

the burning of forests during land clearance. CCS would

The technical maturity of specific ccs system components
varies greatly. Some technologies are extensively deployed
in mature markets, primarily in the oil and gas industry, while
others are still in the research, development or demonstration
phase. Table TS.1 provides an overview of the current status
of all CCS components. As of mid-2005, there have been
three commercial projects linking CO, capture and geological
storage: the offshore Sleipner natural gas processing project
in Norway, the Weyburn Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR)!
project in Canada (which stores CO, captured in the United
States) and the In Salah natural gas project in Algeria. Each
captures and stores 1-2 MtCO, per year. It should be noted,
however, that CCS has not yet been applied at a large (e.g.,
500 MW) fossil-fuel power plant, and that the overall system
may not be as mature as some of its components.

The structure of this Technical Summary follows that of
the Special Report. This introductory section presents the
general framework for the assessment together with a brief
overview of CCS systems. Section 2 then describes the major
sources of CO,, a step needed to assess the feasibility of CCS
on a global scale. Technological options for CO, capture
are then discussed in Section 3, while Section 4 focuses
on methods of CO, transport. Following this, each of the
storage options is addressed. Section 5 focuses on geological
storage, Section 6 on ocean storage, and Section 7 on mineral
carbonation and industrial uses of CO,. The overall costs and
economic potential of CCS are then discussed in Section 8,
followed by an examination in Section 9 of the implications
of CCS for greenhouse gas emissions inventories and
accounting. The Technical Summary concludes with a
discussion of gaps in knowledge, especially those critical for
policy considerations.

"Figure TS.1 illustrates the three main components of the CCS
process: capture, transport and storage. All three components
are found in industrial operations today, although mostly not
for the purpose of CO, storage. The capture step involves
separating CO, from other gaseous products. For fuel-
burning processes such as those in power plants, separation
technologies can be used to capture CO, after combustion
or to decarbonize the fuel before combustion. The transport
step may be required to carry captured CO, to a suitable
storage site located at a distance from the CO, source. To
facilitate both transport and storage, the captured CO, gas is
typically compressed to a high density at the capture facility.
Potential storage methods include injection into underground
geological formations, injection into the deep ocean, or
industrial fixation in inorganic carbonates. Some industrial
processes also might utilize and store small amounts of
captured CO, in manufactured products.

Third Assessment Report (TAR) states that, depending on
the scenario considered, cumulative emissions of hundreds

be prevented during this century to stabilize the CO,
concentration at 450 to 750 ppmv?. The TAR also finds
that, “most model results indicate that known technological
options? could achieve a broad range of atmospheric CO,
stabilization levels”, but that “no single technology option
will provide all of the emissions reductions needed”. Rather,
a combination of mitigation measures will be needed to
achieve stabilization. These known technological options are
available for stabilization, although the TAR cautions that,
“implementation would require associated socio-economic

"In 1992, international concern about climate change led to the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC). The ultimate objective of that Convention is
the “stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the
atmosphere at a level that prevents dangerous anthropogenic
interference with the climate system”. From this perspective,
the context for considering CCS (and other mitigation
options) is that of a world constrained in CO, emissions,
consistent with the international goal of stabilizing
atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Most scenarios
for global energy use project a substantial increase of CO,
emissions throughout this century in the absence of specific
actions to mitigate climate change. They also suggest that
the supply of primary energy will continue to be dominated
by fossil fuels until at least the middle of the century (see
Section 8). The magnitude of the emissions reduction needed
to stabilize the atmospheric concentration of CO, will depend
on both the level of future emissions (the baseline) and the

"Model results presented later in this report suggest that use of
CCS in conjunction with other measures could significantly
reduce the cost of achieving stabilization and would increase
flexibility in achieving these reductions . The heavy worldwide
reliance on fossil fuels today (approximately 80% of global
energy use), the potential for CCS to reduce CO, emissions
over the next century, and the compatibility of CCS systems
with current energy infrastructures explain the interest in this
technology.

"In this context, the availability of CCS in the portfolio of
options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions could facilitate
the achievement of stabilization goals. Other technological
options, which have been examined more extensively in
previous IPCC assessments, include: (1) reducing energy
demand by increasing the efficiency of energy conversion
and/or utilization devices; (2) decarbonizing energy supplies
(either by switching to less carbon-intensive fuels (coal to
natural gas, for example), and/or by increasing the use of
renewable energy sources and/or nuclear energy (each of
which, on balance, emit little or no CO,); (3) sequestering
CO, through the enhancement of natural sinks by biological
fixation; and (4) reducing non-CO, greenhouse gases.

"Research phase means that the basic science is understood, but the technology is currently in the stage of conceptual design or testing at the laboratory or
bench scale, and has not been demonstrated in a pilot plant.

Demonstration phase means that the technology has been built and operated at the scale of a pilot plant, but further development is required before the
technology is required before the technology is ready for the design and construction of a full-scale system.

Economically feasible under specific conditions means that the technology is well understood and used in selected commercial applications, for instance if
there is a favourable tax regime or a niche market, or processing on in the order of 0.1 MtCO, yr', with few (less than 5) replications of the technology.
Mature market means that the technology is now in operation with multiple replications of the technology worldwide.

CO, injection for EOR is a mature market technology, but when used for CO, storage, it is only economically feasible under specific conditions.

ECBM is the use of CO, to enhance the recovery of the methane present in unminable coal beds through the preferential adsorption of CO, on coal.
Unminable coal beds are unlikely to ever be mined, because they are too deep or too thin. If subsequently mined, the stored CO, would be released.

activity arise from a number of different sources, mainly
from the combustion of fossil fuels used in power generation,
transportation, industrial processes, and residential and

industrial processes like cement manufacture or hydrogen

"When analyzing CCS as an option for climate change
mitigation, it is of central importance that all resulting
emissions from the system, especially emissions of CO,, be
identified and assessed in a transparent way. The importance
of taking a “systems” view of CCS is therefore stressed, as
the selection of an appropriate system boundary is essential
for proper analysis. Given the energy requirements associated
with capture and some storage and utilization options, and the
possibility of leaking storage reservoirs, it is vital to assess
the CCS chain as a whole.

Globally, emissions of CO, from fossil-fuel use in the year
2000 totalled about 23.5 GtCO, yr! (6 GtC yr'). Of this, close
to 60% was attributed to large (>0.1 MtCO, yr') stationary
emission sources (see Table TS.2). However, not all of these
sources are amenable to CO, capture. Although the sources
evaluated are distributed throughout the world, the database
reveals four particular clusters of emissions: North America
(midwest and eastern USA), Europe (northwest region),
East Asia (eastern coast of China) and South Asia (Indian
subcontinent). By contrast, large-scale biomass sources are
much smaller in number and less globally distributed.

These systems normally use a liquid solvent to capture the
small fraction of CO, (typically 3-15% by volume) present
in a flue gas stream in which the main constituent is nitrogen

water vapour is then removed by cooling and compressing
the gas stream. Oxyfuel combustion requires the upstream
separation of oxygen from air, with a purity of 95-99%
oxygen assumed in most current designs. Further treatment of
the flue gas may be needed to remove air pollutants and non-
condensed gases (such as nitrogen) from the flue gas before
the CO, is sent to storage. As a method of CO, capture in

"As noted in Section 1, CO, capture is already used in
several industrial applications (see Figure TS.4). The same

used mainly for ammonia and fertilizer manufacture, and for
petroleum refinery operations). The separation of CO, from
raw natural gas (which typically contains significant amounts
of CO,) is also practised on a large scale, using technologies
similar to those used for post-combustion capture. Although
commercial systems are also available for large-scale oxygen

"Pre-combustion systems process the primary fuel in a
reactor with steam and air or oxygen to produce a mixture
consisting mainly of carbon monoxide and hydrogen
(“synthesis gas”). Additional hydrogen, together with CO,,
is produced by reacting the carbon monoxide with steam in
a second reactor (a “shift reactor”). The resulting mixture
of hydrogen and CO, can then be separated into a CO,
gas stream, and a stream of hydrogen. If the CO, is stored,
the hydrogen is a carbon-free energy carrier that can be
combusted to generate power and/or heat. Although the initial
fuel conversion steps are more elaborate and costly than in
post-combustion systems, the high concentrations of CO,
produced by the shift reactor (typically 15 to 60% by volume
on a dry basis) and the high pressures often encountered in
these applications are more favourable for CO, separation.
Pre-combustion would be used at power plants that employ
integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) technology.

"The purpose of CO, capture is to produce a concentrated
stream of CO, at high pressure that can readily be transported
to a storage site. Although, in principle, the entire gas stream
containing low concentrations of CO, could be transported
and injected underground, energy costs and other associated
costs generally make this approach impractical. It is
therefore necessary to produce a nearly pure CO, stream for
transport and storage. Applications separating CO, in large
industrial plants, including natural gas treatment plants and
ammonia production facilities, are already in operation today.
Currently, CO, is typically removed to purify other industrial
gas streams. Removal has been used for storage purposes in
only a few cases; in most cases, the CO, is emitted to the
atmosphere. Capture processes also have been used to obtain
commercially useful amounts of CO, from flue gas streams
generated by the combustion of coal or natural gas. To date,
however, there have been no applications of CO, capture at
large (e.g., 500 MW) power plants.

Figure TS.3 shows a schematic diagram of the main
capture processes and systems. All require a step involving
the separation of CO,, H, or O, from a bulk gas stream
(such as flue gas, synthesis gas, air or raw natural gas).
These separation steps can be accomplished by means of
physical or chemical solvents, membranes, solid sorbents,
or by cryogenic separation. The choice of a specific capture
technology is determined largely by the process conditions
under which it must operate. Current post-combustion and
pre-combustion systems for power plants could capture
85-95% of the CO, that is produced. Higher capture
efficiencies are possible, although separation devices become
considerably larger, more energy intensive and more costly.
Capture and compression need roughly 10-40% more energy
than the equivalent plant without capture, depending on the
type of system. Due to the associated CO, emissions, the net
amount of CO, captured is approximately 80-90%. Oxyfuel
combustion systems are, in principle, able to capture nearly
all of the CO, produced. However, the need for additional gas
treatment systems to remove pollutants such as sulphur and
nitrogen oxides lowers the level of CO, captured to slightly
more than 90%.

The costs of retrofitting existing power plants with co,
capture have not been extensively studied. A limited number
of reports indicate that retrofitting an amine scrubber to an
existing plant results in greater efficiency loss and higher
costs than those shown in Table TS.3. Limited studies also
indicate that a more cost-effective option is to combine
a capture system retrofit with rebuilding the boiler and
turbine to increase plant efficiency and output. For some
existing plants, studies indicate that similar benefits could be
achieved by repowering with an IGCC system that includes
CO, capture technology. The feasibility and cost of all these
options is highly dependent on site-specific factors, including
the size, age and efficiency of the plant, and the availability
of additional space.

"The estimated costs of CO, capture at large power plants
are based on engineering design studies of technologies in
commercial use today (though often in different applications
and/or at smaller scales than those assumed in the literature),
as well as on design studies for concepts currently in
the research and development (R&D) stage. Table TS.3
summarizes the results for new supercritical PC, NGCC and
IGCC plants based on current technology with and without
CO, capture. Capture systems for all three designs reduce
CO, emissions per kWh by approximately 80-90%, taking
into account the energy requirements for capture. All data
for PC and IGCC plants in Table TS.3 are for bituminous
coals only. The capture costs include the cost of compressing
CO, (typically to about 11-14 MPa) but do not include the
additional costs of CO, transport and storage (see Sections

"The monitoring, risk and legal implications of CO, capture
systems do not appear to present fundamentally new
challenges, as they are all elements of regular health, safety
and environmental control practices in industry. However,
CO, capture systems require significant amounts of energy
for their operation. This reduces net plant efficiency, so power
plants require more fuel to generate each kilowatt-hour of
electricity produced. Based on a review of the literature, the
increase in fuel consumption per kWh for plants capturing
90% CO, using best current technology ranges from 24-40%
for new supercritical PC plants, 11-22% for NGCC plants,
and 14-25% for coal-based IGCC systems compared to
similar plants without CCS. The increased fuel requirement
results in an increase in most other environmental emissions
per kWh generated relative to new state-of-the-art plants
without CO, capture and, in the case of coal, proportionally
larger amounts of solid wastes. In addition, there is an
increase in the consumption of chemicals such as ammonia
and limestone used by PC plants for nitrogen oxide and
sulphur dioxide emissions control. Advanced plant designs
that further reduce CCS energy requirements will also reduce
overall environmental impacts as well as cost. Compared to
many older existing plants, more efficient new or rebuilt
plants with CCS may actually yield net reductions in plant-

For the studies listed in Table TS.3, CO, capture increases
the cost of electricity production® by 35-70% (0.01 to 0.02
US$/kWh) for an NGCC plant, 40-85% (0.02 to 0.03 US$/
kWh) for a supercritical PC plant, and 20-55% (0.01 to
0.02 US$/kWh) for an IGCC plant. Overall, the electricity
production costs for fossil fuel plants with capture (excluding
CO, transport and storage costs) ranges from 0.04-0.09 US$/
kWh, as compared to 0.03-0.06 US$/kWh for similar plants
without capture. In most studies to date, NGCC systems have
typically been found to have lower electricity production
costs than new PC and IGCC plants (with or without capture)
in the case of large base-load plants with high capacity factors
(75% or more) and natural gas prices between 2.6 and 4.4
US$ GJ"" over the life of the plant. However, in the case of
higher gas prices and/or lower capacity factors, NGCC plants
often have higher electricity production costs than coal-based
plants, with or without capture. Recent studies also found that
IGCC plants were on average slightly more costly without
capture and slightly less costly with capture than similarly-
sized PC plants. However, the difference in cost between
PC and IGCC plants with or without CO, capture can vary
significantly according to coal type and other local factors,
such as the cost of capital for each plant type. Since full-scale
NGCC, PC and IGCC systems have not yet been built with
CCS, the absolute or relative costs of these systems cannot be
stated with a high degree of confidence at this time.

typically declines as a result of learning-by-doing and other
factors. Although there is considerable uncertainty about
the magnitude and timing of future cost reductions, the
literature suggests that, provided R&D efforts are sustained,
improvements to commercial technologies can reduce current
CO, capture costs by at least 20-30% over approximately the
next ten years, while new technologies under development
could achieve more substantial cost reductions. Future cost
reductions will depend on the deployment and adoption

Liquefied petroleum gases (LPG, principally propane and

marine tankers. CO, can be transported by ship in much the

on the distance and the quantity transported. In the case of

whether there are mountains, large rivers, or frozen ground
on the route. All these factors could double the cost per unit
length, with even larger increases for pipelines in populated

important for EOR, but would not be so significant for CCS.
However, a CO, pipeline through populated areas might need

to be made from a corrosion-resistant alloy, or be internally

pipelines are made from corrosion-resistant alloys, although
the cost of materials is several times larger than carbon-
manganese steels. For ships, the total loss to the atmosphere
is between 3 and 4% per 1000 km, counting both boil-off and
the exhaust from ship engines. Boil-off could be reduced by
capture and liquefaction, and recapture would reduce the loss

"CO, storage in hydrocarbon reservoirs or deep saline

800 m, where the ambient pressures and temperatures will
usually result in CO, being in a liquid or supercritical state.
Under these conditions, the density of CO, will range from
50 to 80% of the density of water. This is close to the density
of some crude oils, resulting in buoyant forces that tend to
drive CO, upwards. Consequently, a well-sealed cap rock over
the selected storage reservoir is important to ensure that CO,
remains trapped underground. When injected underground, the
CO, compresses and fills the pore space by partially displacing
the fluids that are already present (the ‘in situ fluids’). In
oil and gas reservoirs, the displacement of in situ fluids by
injected CO, can result in most of the pore volume being

such as natural gas, oil or brines, are potential candidates for
CO, storage. Suitable storage formations can occur in both
onshore and offshore sedimentary basins (natural large-scale
depressions in the earth’s crust that are filled with sediments).
Coal beds also may be used for storage of CO, (see Figure

shallower depths than CO, storage in hydrocarbon reservoirs

"Once injected into the storage formation, the fraction
retained depends on a combination of physical and

block upward migration of CO, is provided by a layer
of shale and clay rock above the storage formation. This
impermeable layer is known as the “cap rock”. Additional
physical trapping can be provided by capillary forces that
retain CO, in the pore spaces of the formation. In many cases,
however, one or more sides of the formation remain open,
allowing for lateral migration of CO, beneath the cap rock.
In these cases, additional mechanisms are important for the

The estimates of the technical potential® for different
geological storage options are summarized in Table TS.6. The
estimates and levels of confidence are based on an assessment
of the literature, both of regional bottom-up, and global
top-down estimates. No probabilistic approach to assessing
capacity estimates exists in the literature, and this would be
required to quantify levels of uncertainty reliably. Overall
estimates, particularly of the upper limit of the potential, vary
widely and involve a high degree of uncertainty, reflecting
conflicting methodologies in the literature and the fact
that our knowledge of saline formations is quite limited in
most parts of the world. For oil and gas reservoirs, better
estimates are available which are based on the replacement of
hydrocarbon volumes with CO, volumes. It should be noted
that, with the exception of EOR, these reservoirs will not be
available for CO, storage until the hydrocarbons are depleted,
and that pressure changes and geomechanical effects due to
hydrocarbon production in the reservoir may reduce actual
capacity.

Careful storage system design and siting, together with
methods for early detection of leakage (preferably long before
CO, reaches the land surface), are effective ways of reducing
hazards associated with diffuse leakage. The available
monitoring methods are promising, but more experience is
needed to establish detection levels and resolution. Once
leakages are detected, some remediation techniques are
available to stop or control them. Depending on the type
of leakage, these techniques could involve standard well

In the second scenario, leakage could occur through
undetected faults, fractures or through leaking wells where
the release to the surface is more gradual and diffuse. In this
case, hazards primarily affect drinking-water aquifers and
ecosystems where CO, accumulates in the zone between the
surface and the top of the water table. Groundwater can be
affected both by CO, leaking directly into an aquifer and by
brines that enter the aquifer as a result of being displaced
by CO, during the injection process. There may also be
acidification of soils and displacement of oxygen in soils
in this scenario. Additionally, if leakage to the atmosphere
were to occur in low-lying areas with little wind, or in sumps
and basements overlying these diffuse leaks, humans and
animals would be harmed if a leak were to go undetected.
Humans would be less affected by leakage from offshore
storage locations than from onshore storage locations.
Leakage routes can be identified by several techniques and
by characterization of the reservoir. Figure TS.8 shows some
of the potential leakage paths for a saline formation. When
the potential leakage routes are known, the monitoring and
remediation strategy can be adapted to address the potential
leakage.

Currently, there are several treaties (notably the UN
Convention on the Law of the Sea, and the London!! and
OSPAR” Conventions) that could apply to the offshore
injection of CO, into marine environments (both into the
ocean and the geological sub-seabed). All these treaties have
been drafted without specific consideration of CO, storage.
An assessment undertaken by the Jurists and Linguists Group
to the OSPAR Convention (relating to the northeast Atlantic
region), for example, found that, depending on the method and
purpose of injection, CO, injection into the geological sub-
seabed and the ocean could be compatible with the treaty in
some cases, such as when the CO, is transported via a pipeline
from land. A similar assessment is now being conducted by
Parties to the London Convention. Furthermore, papers by
legal commentators have concluded that CO, captured from
an oil or natural gas extraction operation and stored offshore
in a geological formation (like the Sleipner operation) would
not be considered ‘dumping’ under, and would not therefore
be prohibited by, the London Convention.

part of the global carbon cycle. Figure TS.9 shows some of
the main methods that could be employed. Ocean storage has

CO, increases, the ocean gradually takes up additional CO,.

emissions released to the atmosphere over the past 200 years.
As a result of the increased atmospheric CO, concentrations

Analysis of ocean observations and models both indicate
that injected CO, will be isolated from the atmosphere for
at least several hundreds of years, and that the fraction
retained tends to be higher with deeper injection (see Table
TS.7). Ideas for increasing the fraction retained include
forming solid CO, hydrates and/or liquid CO, lakes on the
sea floor, and dissolving alkaline minerals such as limestone
to neutralize the acidic CO,. Dissolving mineral carbonates,
if practical, could extend the storage time scale to roughly
10,000 years, while minimizing changes in ocean pH and

The very small number of public perception studies that
have looked at the ocean storage of CO, indicate that there
is very little public awareness or knowledge of this subject.
In the few studies conducted thus far, however, the public
has expressed greater reservations about ocean storage
than geological storage. These studies also indicate that the

"Mineral carbonation refers to the fixation of CO, using
alkaline and alkaline-earth oxides, such as magnesium
oxide (MgO) and calcium oxide (CaO), which are present
in naturally occurring silicate rocks such as serpentine and
olivine. Chemical reactions between these materials and CO,
produces compounds such as magnesium carbonate (MgCO,)
and calcium carbonate (CaCO,, commonly known as
limestone). The quantity of metal oxides in the silicate rocks
that can be found in the earth’s crust exceeds the amounts
needed to fix all the CO, that would be produced by the
combustion of all available fossil fuel reserves. These oxides
are also present in small quantities in some industrial wastes,
such as stainless steel slags and ashes. Mineral carbonation
produces silica and carbonates that are stable over long
time scales and can therefore be disposed of in areas such
as silicate mines, or re-used for construction purposes (see
Figure TS.10), although such re-use is likely to be small
relative to the amounts produced. After carbonation, CO,
would not be released to the atmosphere. As a consequence,
there would be little need to monitor the disposal sites and
the associated risks would be very low. The storage potential
is difficult to estimate at this early phase of development.
It would be limited by the fraction of silicate reserves that
can be technically exploited, by environmental issues such
as the volume of product disposal, and by legal and societal
constraints at the storage location.

A number of issues still need to be clarified before any
estimates of the storage potential of mineral carbonation can
be given. The issues include assessments of the technical
feasibility and corresponding energy requirements at large
scales, but also the fraction of silicate reserves that can be
technically and economically exploited for CO, storage. The
environmental impact of mining, waste disposal and product
storage could also limit potential. The extent to which
mineral carbonation may be used cannot be determined at

"energy required would be 30 to 50% of the capture plant
output. Considering the additional energy requirements for
the capture of CO,, a CCS system with mineral carbonation
would require 60 to 180% more energy input per kilowatt-
hour than a reference electricity plant without capture
or mineral carbonation. These energy requirements raise
the cost per tonne of CO, avoided for the overall system
significantly (see Section 8). The best case studied so far is
the wet carbonation of natural silicate olivine. The estimated
cost of this process is approximately 50-100 US$/tCO, net
mineralized (in addition to CO, capture and transport costs,
but taking into account the additional energy requirements).
The mineral carbonation process would require 1.6 to 3.7
tonnes of silicates per tonne of CO, to be mined, and produce
2.6 to 4.7 tonnes of materials to be disposed per tonne of
CO, stored as carbonates. This would therefore be a large
operation, with an environmental impact similar to that of
current large-scale surface mining operations. Serpentine

Its presence therefore demands monitoring and mitigation

Industrial uses of CO, can, in principle, contribute
to keeping CO, out of the atmosphere by storing it in the
“carbon chemical pool” (i.e., the stock of carbon-bearing
manufactured products). However, as a measure for mitigating
climate change, this option is meaningful only if the quantity
and duration of CO, stored are significant, and if there is a
real net reduction of CO, emissions. The typical lifetime of
most of the CO, currently used by industrial processes has
storage times of only days to months. The stored carbon is
then degraded to CO, and again emitted to the atmosphere.
Such short time scales do not contribute meaningfully to
climate change mitigation. In addition, the total industrial use
figure of 120 MtCO, yr’ is small compared to emissions from
major anthropogenic sources (see Table TS.2). While some
industrial processes store a small proportion of CO, (totalling
roughly 20 MtCO, yr') for up to several decades, the total
amount of long-term (century-scale) storage is presently in
the order of 1 MtCO, yr' or less, with no prospects for major
increases.

The literature reports a fairly wide range of costs for CCS
components (see Sections 3-7). The range is due primarily to
the variability of site-specific factors, especially the design,
operating and financing characteristics of the power plants or
industrial facilities in which CCS is used; the type and costs
of fuel used; the required distances, terrains and quantities
involved in CO, transport; and the type and characteristics of
the CO, storage. In addition, uncertainty still remains about the
performance and cost of current and future CCS technology
components and integrated systems. The literature reflects
a widely-held belief, however, that the cost of building and
operating CO, capture systems will decline over time as a
result of learning-by-doing (from technology deployment)
and sustained R&D. Historical evidence also suggests that
costs for first-of-a-kind capture plants could exceed current
estimates before costs subsequently decline. In most CCS
systems, the cost of capture (including compression) is the
largest cost component. Costs of electricity and fuel vary
considerably from country to country, and these factors also

influence the economic viability of CCS options.

part of the production process, such as hydrogen production
(the cost of capture for hydrogen production was reported
earlier in Table TS.4). The full CCS cost, including transport

"In addition to fossil fuel-based energy conversion
processes, CO, could also be captured in power plants fueled
with biomass, or fossil-fuel plants with biomass co-firing.
At present, biomass plants are small in scale (less than 100
MW.). This means that the resulting costs of production
with and without CCS are relatively high compared to fossil
alternatives. Full CCS costs for biomass could amount to 110
US$/tCO, avoided. Applying CCS to biomass-fuelled or co-
fired conversion facilities would lead to lower or negative!?
CO, emissions, which could reduce the costs for this option,
depending on the market value of CO, emission reductions.
Similarly, CO, could be captured in biomass-fueled H,
plants. The cost is reported to be 22-25 US$/tCO, (80-92

potentially benefit from economies of scale, bringing down
costs of the CCS systems to levels broadly similar to coal

large-scale biomass plants, so their feasibility has not been

Table TS.11 summarizes the range of estimated costs for

that where a PC plant is planned initially, using CCS in that

these studies allow future releases to be compensated by
additional reductions in emissions; the results depend on
assumptions regarding the future cost of reductions, discount

the uncertainty of long-term socio-economic, demographic

Because CCS has the potential to move CO, across traditional

country and stored in another, or captured in one year and
partly released from storage in a later year), the rules and

The IPCC Guidelines (IPCC 1996) and Good Practice
Guidance Reports (IPCC 2000; 2003) also contain guidelines
for monitoring greenhouse gas emissions. It is not known
whether the revised guidelines of the IPCC for CCS can
be satisfied by using monitoring techniques, particularly
for geological and ocean storage. Several techniques are
available for the monitoring and verification of CO, emissions
from geological storage, but they vary in applicability,
detection limits and uncertainties. Currently, monitoring for
geological storage can take place quantitatively at injection
and qualitatively in the reservoir and by measuring surface
fluxes of CO,. Ocean storage monitoring can take place by

the UNFCCC accepted the idea that net emissions can be
reduced through biological sinks, but has imposed complex
rules for such accounting. CCS is markedly different in many
ways from CO, sequestration in the terrestrial biosphere (see
Table TS.12), and the different forms of CCS are markedly
different from one another. However, the main goal of
accounting is to ensure that CCS activities produce real
and quantifiable reductions in net emissions. One tonne of
CO, permanently stored has the same benefit in terms of
atmospheric CO, concentrations as one tonne of CO, not
emitted, but one tonne of CO, temporarily stored has less
benefit. It is generally accepted that this difference should be
reflected in any system of accounting for reductions in net
greenhouse gas emissions.

"The Kyoto Protocol creates different units of accounting
for greenhouse gas emissions, emissions reductions,
and emissions sequestered under different compliance
mechanisms. ‘Assigned amount units’ (AAUs) describe
emissions commitments and apply to emissions trading,
‘certified emission reductions’ (CERs) are used under the
CDM, and ‘emission reduction units’ (ERUs) are employed
under JI. To date, international negotiations have provided
little guidance about methods for calculating and accounting
for project-related CO, reductions from CCS systems (only
CERs or ERUs), and it is therefore uncertain how such
reductions will be accommodated under the Kyoto Protocol.
Some guidance may be given by the methodologies for
biological-sink rules. Moreover, current agreements do not
deal with cross-border CCS projects. This is particularly
important when dealing with cross-border projects involving
CO, capture in an ‘Annex B’ country that is party to the
Kyoto Protocol but stored in a country that is not in Annex B

- The extent of emissions reduction required will depend on
the rate of emissions and the atmospheric concentration target.
The lower the chosen stabilization concentration and the higher
the rate of emissions expected in the absence of mitigation
measures, the larger must be the reduction in emissions and
the earlier that it must occur. In many of the models that
IPCC has considered, stabilization at a level of 550 ppmv of
CO, in the atmosphere would require a reduction in global
emissions by 2100 of 7-70% compared with current rates.
Lower concentrations would require even greater reductions.
Achieving this cost-effectively will be easier if we can choose
flexibly from a broad portfolio of technology options of the
kind described above.

"There are many factors that must be considered when
deciding what role CO, capture and storage could play in
mitigating climate change. These include the cost and capacity
of emission reduction relative to, or in combination with, other
options, the resulting increase in demand for primary energy
sources, the range of applicability, and the technical risk. Other
important factors are the social and environmental consequences,
the safety of the technology, the security of storage and ease of
monitoring and verification, and the extent of opportunities to
transfer the technology to developing countries. Many of these
features are interlinked. Some aspects are more amenable to
rigorous evaluation than others. For example, the literature
about the societal aspects of this new mitigation option is
limited. Public attitudes, which are influenced by many factors,
including how judgements are made about the technology, will
also exert an important influence on its application. All of these
aspects are discussed in this report.
"	Text
"The purpose of this report is to assess the characteristics
of CO, capture and storage as part of a portfolio of this kind.
There are three main components of the process: capturing
CO,, for example by separating it from the flue gas stream of a
fuel combustion system and compressing it to a high pressure;
transporting it to the storage site; and storing it. CO, storage
will need to be done in quantities of gigatonnes of CO, per year
to make a significant contribution to the mitigation of climate
change, although the capture and storage of smaller amounts, at
costs similar to or lower than alternatives, would make a useful
contribution to lowering emissions. Several types of storage
reservoir may provide storage capacities of this magnitude. In
some cases, the injection of CO, into oil and gas fields could
lead to the enhanced production of hydrocarbons, which would
help to offset the cost. CO, capture technology could be applied
to electric-power generation facilities and other large industrial
sources of emissions; it could also be applied in the manufacture
of hydrogen as an energy carrier. Most stages of the process
build on known technology developed for other purposes.

"The capture and storage of carbon dioxide is a technically
feasible method of making deep reductions in CO, emissions
from sources such as those mentioned above. Although it can be
implemented mainly by applying known technology developed
for other purposes, its potential role in tackling climate change
was not recognized as early as some other mitigation options.
Indeed, the topic received little attention in IPCC’s Second and
Third Assessment Reports (IPCC 1996a, 2001b) — the latter
contained a three-page review of technological progress, and
an overview of costs and the environmental risks of applying
such technology. In recent years, the technical literature on
this field has expanded rapidly. Recognizing the need for a
broad approach to assessing mitigation options, the potential
importance of issues relating to CO, capture and storage and
the extensive literature on other options (due to their longer
history), IPCC decided to undertake a thorough assessment
of CO, capture and storage. For these reasons it was thought
appropriate to prepare a Special Report on the subject. This
would constitute a source of information of comparable nature to
the information available on other, more established mitigation
options. In response to the invitation from the 7"" Conference of
the Parties to the UNFCCC in Marrakech’, the IPCC plenary

the Third Assessment Report, IPCC made an effort to identify
future GHG emission pathways. Using several assumptions,
IPCC built a set of scenarios of what might happen to emissions
up to the year 2100. Six groups of scenarios were published
(IPCC, 2000a): the “SRES scenarios’. None of these assume
any specific climate policy initiatives; in other words, they are
base cases which can be used for considering the effects of
mitigation options. An illustrative scenario was chosen for each
of the groups. The six groups were organized into four ‘families’
covering a wide range of key ‘future’ characteristics such as
demographic change, economic development, and technological
change (IPCC, 2000a). Scenario families Al and A2 emphasize
economic development, whilst B1 and B2 emphasize global
and local solutions for, respectively, economic, social and
environmental sustainability. In addition, two scenarios,
AIF1 and AIT, illustrate alternative developments in energy

The Third Assessment Report (IPCC, 2001a) shows that, in
many of the models that IPCC considered, achieving stabilization
at a level of 550 ppmv would require global emissions to be
reduced by 7-70% by 2100 (depending upon the stabilization
profile) compared to the level of emissions in 2001. If the target
were to be lower (450 ppmv), even deeper reductions (55-90%)
would be required. For the purposes of this discussion, we will
use the term ‘deep reductions’ to imply net reductions of 80%
or more compared with what would otherwise be emitted by an
individual al power plant or industrial facility.

"As mentioned above, the UN Framework Convention on
Climate Change calls for the stabilization of the atmospheric
concentration of GHGs but, at present, there is no agreement on
what the specific level should be. However, it can be recognized
that stabilization of concentrations will only occur once the
rate of addition of GHGs to the atmosphere equals the rate at
which natural systems can remove them — in other words, when
the rate of anthropogenic emissions is balanced by the rate of
uptake by natural processes such as atmospheric reactions, net
transfer to the oceans, or uptake by the biosphere.

"This shows that the level of CO, emissions can be understood to
depend directly on the size of the human population, on the level
of global wealth, on the energy intensity of the global economy,
and on the emissions arising from the production and use of
energy. At present, the population continues to rise and average
energy use is also rising, whilst the amount of energy required
per unit of GDP is falling in many countries, but only slowly
(IPCC, 2001d). So achieving deep reductions in emissions will,
all other aspects remaining constant, require major changes in
the third and fourth factors in this equation, the emissions from
energy technology. Meeting the challenge of the UNFCCC’s
goal will therefore require sharp falls in emissions from energy
technology.

In general, the lower the stabilization target ‘and the higher
the level of baseline emissions, the larger the required reduction
in emissions below the baseline, and the earlier that it must
occur. For example, stabilization at 450 ppmv CO, would
require emissions to be reduced earlier than stabilization at 650
ppmv, with very rapid emission reductions over the next 20 to
30 years (IPCC, 2000a); this could require the employment of
all cost-effective potential mitigation options (IPCC, 2001a).
Another conclusion, no less relevant than the previous one, is
that the range of baseline scenarios tells us that future economic
development policies may impact greenhouse gas emissions as
strongly as policies and technologies especially developed to
address climate change. Some have argued that climate change
is more an issue of economic development, for both developed
and developing countries, than it is an environmental issue
(Moomaw et al., 1999).

hydro, geothermal and tidal power, depending on geographic
location. Many of them could make significant contributions
to electricity generation, as well as to vehicle fuelling and
space heating or cooling, thereby displacing fossil fuels (IPCC,

related to cost, intermittency of supply, land use and other
environmental impacts. Between 1992 and 2002, installed wind
power generation capacity grew at a rate of about 30% per year,
reaching over 31 GW, by the end of 2002 (Gipe, 2004). Solar
electricity generation has increased rapidly (by about 30% per
year), achieving 1.1 GW, capacity in 2001, mainly in small-
scale installations (World Energy Assessment, 2004). This has
occurred because of falling costs as well as promotional policies
in some countries. Liquid fuel derived from biomass has also
expanded considerably and is attracting the attention of several
countries, for example Brazil, due to its declining costs and
co-benefits in creation of jobs for rural populations. Biomass
used for electricity generation is growing at about 2.5% per

for heat was estimated to have capacity of 210 GW,, in 2001.
Geothermal energy used for electricity is also growing in both

many options which could make deep reductions by substituting
for fossil fuels, although the cost is significant for some and the

Suitable techniques were developed 60 years ago in connection

they were adapted for related purposes, such as capturing CO,
from the flue gas streams of coal- or gas-burning plant for the
carbonation of drinks and brine, and for enhancing oil recovery.
These developments required improvements to the process so
as to inhibit the oxidation of the solvent in the flue gas stream.

As a result of the 2002 IPCC workshop on CO, capture and
storage (IPCC, 2002), it is now recognized that the amount of
CO, emissions which could potentially be captured and stored
may be higher than the value given in the Third Assessment
Report. Indeed, the emissions reduction may be very significant
compared with the values quoted above for the period after 2020.
Wider use of this option may tend to restrict the opportunity
to use other supply options. Nevertheless, such action might
still lead to an increase in emissions abatement because much
of the potential estimated previously (IPCC, 2001a) was from
the application of measures concerned with end uses of energy.
Some applications of CCS cost relatively little (for example,
storage of CO, from gas processing as in the Sleipner project
(Baklid et al., 1996)) and this could allow them to be used at
a relatively early date. Certain large industrial sources could
present interesting low-cost opportunities for CCS, especially
if combined with storage opportunities which generate
compensating revenue, such as CO, Enhanced Oil Recovery
(IEA GHG, 2002). This is discussed in Chapter 2.

for enhanced oil recovery'! since the 1970s (Blunt et al., 1993;
Stevens and Gale, 2000). In some cases, this could lead to the
enhanced production of hydrocarbons, which would help to
offset the cost. An extension of this idea involves injection into
saline formations (Koide et al., 1992) or into unminable coal
seams (Gunter et al., 1997); in the latter case, such injection
may sometimes result in the displacement of methane, which
could be used as a fuel. The world’s first commercial-scale

There are various ways of expressing the cost data (Freund

terms of US$/tCO, avoided, which has the important feature
of taking into account the additional energy (and emissions)
resulting from capturing the CO,. This is very important for
understanding the full effects on the particular plant of capturing
CO,, especially the increased use of energy. However, as a means
of comparing mitigation options, this can be confusing since the
answer depends on the base case chosen for the comparison
(i.e., what is being avoided). Hence, for comparisons with
other ways of supplying energy or services, the cost of systems
with and without capture are best presented in terms of a unit
of product such as the cost of generation (e.g., US$ MWh!)

options for a collection of plants (such as a national electricity

In developing monitoring strategies, especially for reasons
of regulatory compliance and verification, a key question is
how long the monitoring must continue; clearly, monitoring
will be needed throughout the injection phase but the frequency
and extent of monitoring after injection has been completed still
needs to be determined, and the organization(s) responsible for
monitoring in the long term will have to be identified. In addition,
when CO, is used, for example, in enhanced oil recovery, it will
be necessary to establish the net amount of CO, stored. The
extent to which the guidelines for reporting emissions already
developed by IPCC need to be adapted for this new mitigation
option is discussed in Chapter 9.

In addition to the known reserves, there are significant resources
that, through technological advances and the willingness of
society to pay more for them, may be converted into commercial
fuels in the future. Furthermore, there are thought to be large
amounts of non-conventional oil (e.g., heavy oil, tars sands,
shales) and gas (e.g., methane hydrates). A quantification of
these in the Third Assessment Report (IPCC, 2001a) showed
that fully exploiting the known oil and natural gas resources
(without any emission control), plus the use of non-conventional
resources, would cause atmospheric concentrations of CO,
to rise above 750 ppmv. In addition, coal resources are even
larger than those of oil and gas; consuming all of them would
enable the global economy to emit 5 times as much CO, as
has been released since 1850 (5,200 GtCO, or 1,500 GtC) (see
Chapter 3 in IPCC, 2001a). A scenario for achieving significant
reductions in emissions but without the use of CCS (Berk et
al., 2001) demonstrates the extent to which a shift away from
fossil fuels would be required to stabilize at 450 ppmv by 2100.
Thus, sufficient fossil fuels exist for continued use for decades
to come. This means that the availability of fossil fuels does not
limit the potential application of CO, capture and storage; CCS
would provide a way of limiting the environmental impact of
the continued use of fossil fuels.

The terrestrial biosphere stores and releases both natural and
fossil fuel CO, through the global carbon cycle. It is difficult
to provide a simple picture of the fraction retained because
of the dynamic nature of this process. Typically, however,
99% is stored for decades to centuries, although the average
lifetime will be towards the lower end of that range. The
terrestrial biosphere at present is a net sink for carbon
dioxide but some current biological sinks are becoming net
sources as temperatures rise. The annual storage flows and
total carbon storage capacity can be enhanced by forestry
and soil management practices. Terrestrial sequestration is
not explicitly considered in this report but it is covered in
IPCC, 2000b.

Oceans hold the largest amount of mobile CO,. They absorb
and release natural and fossil fuel CO, according to the
dynamics of the global carbon cycle, and this process results
in changes in ocean chemistry. The fraction retained by ocean
storage at 3,000 m depth could be around 85% after 500
years. However, this process has not yet been demonstrated
at a significant scale for long periods. Injection at shallower
depths would result in shorter retention times. Chapter 6
discusses the storage capacity and fractions retained for
ocean storage.

In geological storage, a picture of the likely fraction retained
may be gained from the observation of natural systems
where CO, has been in natural geological reservoirs for
millions of years. It may be possible to engineer storage
reservoirs that have comparable performance. The fraction
retained in appropriately selected and managed geological
reservoirs is likely to exceed 99% over 1000 years. However,
sudden gas releases from geological reservoirs could be
triggered by failure of the storage seal or the injection well,
earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, or if the reservoir were
accidentally punctured by subsequent drilling activity. Such
releases might have significant local effects. Experience
with engineered natural-gas-storage facilities and natural
CO, reservoirs may be relevant to understanding whether
such releases might occur. The storage capacity and fraction
retained for the various geological storage options are
discussed in Chapter 5.

time) of CO, in the atmosphere is often said to be about 100

climate change typically assume that action will be needed

practice, geological and mineral storage would have lower rates of release than
this (see chapters 5 and 7) and hence higher effectiveness — for example, a

Pacala (2003) examined unintended releases using a

security varies between the different reservoirs. Although
this seemed to suggest that quite high release rates could be

as the political and economic risk that policies will not be

due to the possibility of non-zero releases which may preclude

All of the SRES scenarios (IPCC, 2000a) show significant
consumption of fossil fuels for a long time into the future. One
of the consequences of deploying CCS would be a continued
use of fossil fuels in the energy mix but the minimization of
their effect on the climate system and environment. By enabling
countries to access a wider range of energy supplies than would
otherwise be the case, energy security will be improved. Such

The implementation of CCS would contribute to the
preservation of much of the energy infrastructure established
in the last century and may help restrain the cost of meeting
the target for emissions reduction. From another perspective,
its use may reduce the potential for application of alternative
energy sources (Edmonds ef al., 2001). As noted in section

seems likely that any eventual solution will involve a portfolio

The fossil fuel « energy system and its infrastructure can be
thought of as a technology cluster. Such a phenomenon can be
recognized as possibly presenting dangers as well as offering
benefits for society. It can lead to specialization as innovations
improve on dominant technologies, thereby generating further
innovations which help to retain market share. On the other
hand, innovations in technologies with small market shares are
less valuable and so there is less incentive to improve on those
technologies; a minor technology can therefore become trapped
by high costs and a small market share. This phenomenon leads
to path dependence or technology lock-in (Bulter and Hofkes,
2004; Unruh, 2000). Although CCS has not yet been examined
specifically in this respect, it may be that reinforcing the
position of the fossil fuel energy system may present barriers to
increased technological diversity (a key element in evolutionary
change; see Nelson and Winter, 1982).

Some legal questions about CCS can be identified and answered
relatively easily; for example, the legal issues relating to the
process of capturing CO, seem likely to be similar to those facing
any large chemical plant. Transporting CO, through pipelines
can probably be managed under current regulatory regimes for
domestic and international pipelines. The extent to which the
CO, is contaminated with other substances, such as compounds
of sulphur (see Chapter 4), might alter its classification to that
of a hazardous substance, subjecting it to more restrictive
regulation. However, the storage of carbon dioxide is likely
to pose new legal challenges. What licensing procedure will
be required by national authorities for storage in underground
reservoirs onshore? It seems likely that factors to be considered
will include containment criteria, geological stability, potential
hazard, the possibility of interference with other underground
or surface activities and agreement on sub-surface property
rights, and controls on drilling or mining nearby.

"A further class of legal issues concerns the responsibility
for stored carbon dioxide. This is relevant because the CO, will
have been the subject of a contract for storage, or a contract
for emissions reduction, and/or because of the possibility of
unintended release. Should society expect private companies to
be responsible over centuries for the storage of CO,? A judgement
may have to be made about a reasonable balance between the
costs and benefits to current and to future generations. In the
case of the very long-term storage of nuclear waste, states have
taken on the responsibility for managing storage; the companies
that generate the waste, and make a profit from using the nuclear
material, pay a fee to the government to take responsibility. In
other fields, the deep-well injection of hazardous materials is
sometimes the responsibility of governments and sometimes
the responsibility of the companies concerned under a licensing
system (IEA GHG, 2004b). Rules about insurance and about
liability (if there were to be a release of CO,) will need to be
developed so that, even if something happens in the distant
future, when the company that stored it is no longer in business,
there will be a means of ensuring another organization is capable

At the time of writing, it is uncertain whether CCS projects

Sustainable development is too complex a subject for a
simple summary; the study of this field aims to assess the benefits
and trade-offs involved in the pursuit of the multiple goals of
environmental conservation, social equity, economic growth,
and eradication of poverty (IPCC, 2001a, Chapter 1). Most of
the studies only make a first attempt to integrate a number of
important sustainable development indicators and only a few
have considered the implications for CCS (Turkenburg, 1997).
To date, studies have focused on short-term side-effects of
climate change mitigation policies (e.g., impact on local air
and water quality) but they have also suggested a number of
additional indicators to reflect development (e.g., job creation)
and social impact (e.g., income distribution). CCS also poses
issues relating to long-term liability for possible unintended
releases or contamination which may have inter-generational
and, in some cases, international consequences™. Further
studies will be needed to develop suitable answers about CCS.
In particular, long-term liability must be shown to be compatible

"these countries wish to reduce the rate of increase of emissions,
they will want to have access to a range of mitigation options,
one of which could be CCS. Initially it seems likely that CCS
would be exploited by countries with relevant experience, such
as oil and gas production”, but this may not be the case in other
natural resource sectors. Will there be fewer opportunities for
the transfer of CCS technology than for other mitigation options
where technologies are in the hands of numerous companies?
Or will the knowledge and experience already available in
the energy sector in certain developing countries provide an
opportunity for them to exploit CCS technologies? Will CO,
capture and storage technologies attract more interest from
certain developing countries if applied to biomass sources”°? If
there is a year-round supply of CO, from the biomass processing
plant and good storage reservoirs within reasonable distance,
this could be an important opportunity for technology transfer.
As yet there are no answers to these questions.

"Technology transfer faces several barriers, including intellectual
property rights, access to capital, etc. As with any new technology,
CCS opens opportunities for proprietary rights. As it will rely
on the development and/or integration of technologies, some of
which are not yet used for such purposes, there is considerable
scope for learning by doing. Several developing countries are
already taking an active interest in this option, where they
have national resources that would allow them to make use of
this technique. For example, Deshun et al. (1998) have been
looking at the related technique of CO,-EOR. Some of the key
technologies will be developed by particular companies (as is
occurring with wind power and solar photovoltaics) but will the
intellectual property for CCS be accumulated in the hands of a
few? CCS will involve both existing and future technologies,
some of which will be proprietary. Will the owners of these
rights to be willing to exploit their developments by licensing
others to use them? At present it appears to be too early to
answer these questions.

"as bias

Given that the essential parts of CCS systems are based
on established technology, it can be expected that it will be
accessible to anyone who can afford it and wants to buy it.
Several companies currently offer competing methods of
capturing CO,; pipelines for CO, and ships are constructed
today by companies specializing in this type of equipment; the
drilling of injection wells is standard practice in the oil and gas
industry, and is carried out by many companies around the world.
More specialist skills may be required to survey geological
reservoirs; indeed, monitoring of CO, underground is a very
new application of seismic analysis. However, it is anticipated
that, within a short space of time, these will become as widely
available as other techniques derived from the international
oil and gas industry. Making these technologies available to
developing countries will pose similar challenges as those
encountered with other modern technological developments.
This shows the relevance of the UNFCCC declaration on
technology transfer quoted above to ensure that developing
countries have access to the option of CO, capture and storage.

Comparing the geographical distribution of the emission
sources with geological storage opportunities, it can be seen
that there is a good match between sources and opportunities. A
substantial proportion of the emission sources are either on top
of, or within 300 km from, a site with potential for geological
storage. Detailed studies are, however, needed to confirm the
suitability of such sites for CO, storage. In the case of ocean
storage, related research suggests that only a small proportion of
large emission sources will be close to potential ocean storage
sites.

According to six illustrative SRES scenarios, global CO,
emissions could range from 29.3 to 44.2 GtCO, (8-12 GtC)
in 2020 and from 22.5 to 83.7 GtCO, (6-23 GtC) in 2050.
The technical potential of CO, capture associated with these
emission ranges has been estimated recently at 2.6-4.9 GtCO,
for 2020 (0.7-1.3 GtC) and 4.9-37.5 GtCO, for 2050 (1.3-10
GtC). These emission and capture ranges reflect the inherent
uncertainties of scenario and modelling analyses. However,
there is one trend common to all of the six illustrative SRES
scenarios: the general increase of future CO, emissions in the
developing countries relative to the industrialized countries.
"	Text
"The majority of the emissions sources have concentrations
of CO, that are typically lower than 15%. However, a small
proportion (less than 2%) have concentrations that exceed
95%, making them more suitable for CO, capture. The high-
content sources open up the possibility of lower capture costs
compared to low-content sources because only dehydration
and compression are required. The future proportion of high-
and low-content CO, sources will largely depend on the rate
of introduction of hydrogen, biofuels, and the gasification or
liquefaction of fossil fuels, as well as future developments in
plant sizes.

Over 7,500 large CO, emission sources (above 0.1 MtCO,
yr') have been identified. These sources are distributed
geographically around the world but four clusters of emissions
can be observed: in North America (the Midwest and the eastern
freeboard of the USA), North West Europe, South East Asia
(eastern coast) and Southern Asia (the Indian sub-continent).
Projections for the future (up to 2050) indicate that the number
of emission sources from the power and industry sectors is
likely to increase, predominantly in Southern and South East
Asia, while the number of emission sources suitable for capture
and storage in regions like Europe may decrease slightly.

"Assessing CO, capture and storage calls for a comprehensive
delineation of CO, sources. The attractiveness of a particular
CO, source for capture depends on its volume, concentration
and partial pressure, integrated system aspects, and its proximity
to a suitable reservoir. Emissions of CO, arise from a number of
sources, mainly fossil fuel combustion in the power generation,
industrial, residential and transport sectors. In the power
generation and industrial sectors, many sources have large
emission volumes that make them amenable to the addition of
CO, capture technology. Large numbers of small point sources
and, in the case of transport, mobile sources characterize the
other sectors, making them less amenable for capture at present.
Technological changes in the production and nature of transport
fuels, however, may eventually allow the capture of CO, from
energy use in this sector.

Over 7.500 larce CO. emission sources (ahove 0.1 MtCQO_
"	Text
"Chapter | showed that the power and industry sectors
combined dominate current global CO, emissions, accounting
for about 60% of total CO, emissions (see Section 1.2.2).
Future projections indicate that the share of these sectoral
emissions will decline to around 50% of global CO, emissions
by 2050 CEA, 2002). The CO, emissions in these sectors are
generated by boilers and furnaces burning fossil fuels and are
typically emitted from large exhaust stacks. These stacks can be
described as large stationary sources, to distinguish them from
mobile sources such as those in the transport sector and from
smaller stationary sources such as small heating boilers used
in the residential sector. The large stationary sources represent
potential opportunities for the addition of CO, capture plants.
The volumes produced from these sources are usually large and
the plants can be equipped with a capture plant to produce a
source of high-purity CO, for subsequent storage. Of course, not
all power generation and industrial sites produce their emissions
from a single point source. At large industrial complexes like
refineries there will be multiple exhaust stacks, which present
an additional technical challenge in terms of integrating an
exhaust-gas gathering system in an already congested complex,
undoubtedly adding t to capture costs sts (Simmonds et al., 2003).

For the purposes of this report, large stationary sources are
considered to be those emitting over 0.1 MtCO, yr'. This
threshold was selected because the sources emitting less than 0.1
MtCO, yr' together account for less than 1% of the emissions
from all the stationary sources under consideration (see Table

"as a fuel in the power sector is currently limited. Fuel selection in
the industrial sector is largely sector-specific. For example, the
use of blast furnaces dominates primary steel production in the
iron and steel sector, which primarily uses coal and coke (IEA
GHG, 2000b; IPCC, 2001). In the refining and chemical sectors,
oil and gas are the primary fuels. For industries like cement
manufacture, all fossil fuels are used, with coal dominating in
areas like the USA, China and India IEA GHG, 1999), and oil
and gas in countries like Mexico (Sheinbaum and Ozawa, 1998).
However, the current trend in European cement manufacture is
to use non-fossil fuels: these consist principally of wastes like
tyres, sewage sludge and chemical-waste mixtures IEA GHG,
1999). In global terms, biomass is not usually a significant
fuel source in the large manufacturing industries. However, in
certain regions of the world, like Scandinavia and Brazil, it is
acknowledged that biomass use can be significant (MOllersten

"Other sectors of the economy, such as the residential

emissions. However, the emission volumes from the individual
sources in these sectors tend to be small in comparison to those
from the power and industry sectors and are much more widely
distributed, or even mobile rather than stationary. It is currently
not considered to be technically possible to capture emissions
from these other small stationary sources, because there are still
substantial technical and economic issues that need to be resolved
(IPCC, 2001). However, in the future, the use of low-carbon
energy carriers, such as electricity or hydrogen produced from
fossil fuels, may allow CO, emissions to be captured from the
residential and transport sectors as well. Such fuels would most
probably be produced in large centralized plants and would be

"To reduce the CO, emissions from the power and industry
sectors through the use of CO, capture and storage, it is important
to understand where these emissions arise and what their
geographical relationship is with respect to potential storage
opportunities (Gale, 2002). If there is a good geographical
relationship between the large stationary emission sources
and potential geological storage sites then it is possible that a
significant proportion of the emissions from these sources can
be reduced using CO, capture and storage. If, however, they are
not well matched geographically, then there will be implications
for the length and size of the transmission infrastructure that
is required, and this could impact significantly on the cost of
CO, capture and storage, and on the potential to achieve deep
reductions in global CO, emissions. It may be the case that
there are regions of the world that have greater potential for
the application of CO, capture and storage than others given
their source/storage opportunity relationship. Understanding
the regional differences will be an important factor in assessing
how much of an impact CO, capture and storage can have
on global emissions reduction and which of the portfolio of

The properties of those streams that can be inputted to a CO,
capture process are discussed in this section. In CO, capture, the
CO, partial pressure of the gas stream to be treated is important
as well as the concentration of the stream. For practical purposes,
this partial pressure can be defined as the product of the total
pressure of the gas stream times the CO, mole fraction. It is a
key variable in the selection of the separation method (this is
discussed further in Chapter 3). As a rule of thumb, it can be
said that the lower the CO, partial pressure of a gas stream, the

Typical CO, concentrations and their corresponding partial
pressures for large stationary combustion sources are shown in
Table 2.1, which also includes the newer Integrated Gasification
Combined Cycle technology (IGCC). Typically, the majority
of emission sources from the power sector and from industrial
processes have low CO, partial pressures; hence the focus of
the discussion in this section. Where emission sources with
high partial pressure are generated, for example in ammonia
or hydrogen production, these sources require only dehydration
and some compression, and therefore they have lower capture

Carbon dioxide levels in flue gases vary depending on
the type of fuel used and the excess air level used for optimal
combustion conditions. Flue gas volumes also depend on these
two variables. Natural-gas-fired power generation plants are
typically combined cycle gas turbines which generate flue gases
with low CO, concentrations, typically 3-4% by volume (IEA
GHG, 2002a). Coal for power generation is primarily burnt in
pulverized-fuel boilers producing an atmospheric pressure flue
gas stream with a CO, content of up to 14% by volume (IEA
GHG, 2002a). The newer and potentially more efficient IGCC
technology has been developed for generating electricity from
coal, heavy fuel oil and process carbonaceous residues. In this
process the feedstock is first gasified to generate a synthesis gas
(often referred to as ‘syngas’), which is burnt in a gas turbine
after exhaustive gas cleaning (Campbell et al., 2000). Current
IGCC plants where the synthesis gas is directly combusted in
the turbine, like conventional thermal power plants, produce a
flue gas with low CO, concentrations (up to 14% by volume).
At present, there are only fifteen coal- and oil-fired IGCC
plants, ranging in size from 40 to 550 MW. They were started
up in the 1980s and 1990s in Europe and the USA (Giuffrida et
al., 2003). It should be noted that there are conceptual designs
in which the CO, can be removed before the synthesis gas is
combusted, producing a high-concentration, high-pressure CO,
exhaust gas stream that could be more suitable for storage (see
Chapter 3 for more details). However, no such plants have been
built or are under construction.

removed in some petrochemical processes, particularly those
using synthesis gas as an intermediate or as an impurity in

CO, is customarily removed in some of these industries are
shown in Table 2.2. It can be seen from Table 2.1 that the CO,

suitable candidates for CO, capture before or after combustion.
For example, the off-gas from an oxygen-steel furnace typically

of low- to high-purity emission sources; this is discussed in
more detail in Section 2.5.2.

- Figure 2.3 shows the known locations of stationary CO,
sources worldwide, as taken from the database referred to in
Section 2.2 (IEA GHG, 2002a). North America is the region
with the largest number of stationary sources (37%), followed
by Asia (24%) and OECD Europe? (14%). Figure 2.3 shows
three large clusters of stationary sources located in the central
and eastern states of the US, in northwestern and central regions
of Europe (Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary,
Netherlands and UK) and in Asia (eastern China and Japan with
an additional smaller cluster in the Indian subcontinent).

circumstances (i.e. a price for CO, reductions and the costs of other options).

+ For the four marker scenarios and the technology-intensive AlT and
the fossil-intensive AIFI illustrative scenarios, it is important to note that
comparisons between the results of different models are not straightforward.
First, the modelling methodologies imply different representations of energy
technologies and their future evolutions. Secondly, the sectoral disaggregation
and the energy/fuel details vary across the models. Thirdly, there are differences
in how countries of the world are grouped together into regions. Tables 2.5 and
2.6 are based on the work by Toth and Rogner (2005) that attempts to create
the best possible approximation for the purposes of comparing the regional and
sectoral model and scenario results.
"	Text
"> As regards the share of emissions across sectors in 2020 (Table 2.5), there
is an inherent divergence between scenarios with longer and shorter time
horizons. Given the quasi perfect foresight of the underlying models, the SRES
scenarios account for resource depletion over a period of a century and, due
to the anticipated transition to higher-fuel-cost categories in the longer run,
they shift to non-fossil energy sources much earlier than, for example, the IEA
scenarios, especially for electricity supply. Consequently, the range for the
shares of fossil-sourced power generation is between 43 and 58% for 2020,
while the IEA projects a share of 71%. The corresponding sectoral shares in
CO, emissions mirror the electricity generating mix: the IEA projects 43% for
power generation (IEA, 2002) compared to a range of 28 to 32% in the six
illustrative SRES scenarios.
"	Text
"The total CO, emissions from fossil fuel combustion in the SRES
scenarios provide the upper limit for potential CO, capture for
this assessment. In fact, the theoretical maximum is even higher
because of the possibility of CO, capture from biomass. These
emissions are also included in the tables of CO, emissions and
they are therefore potentially available for capture. Obviously,
the capture potential that is practical in technical terms is
much smaller than the theoretical maximum, and the economic
potential’ is even smaller. Needless to say, it is the economic
potential that matters most. This section presents estimates of
the technical potential and Chapter 8 will address the economic
potential.

"higher than reported in SRES because emissions from biomass
are explicitly included here (as these are potentially available
for capture), while they where considered “‘climate-neutral” in
the SRES presentations and therefore not counted as emission
releases to the atmosphere. Geographically, the distribution of
emission sources is set to change substantially. Between 2000
and 2050, the bulk of emission sources will shift from the
OECD countries to the developing regions, especially China,
South Asia and Latin America. As to emissions by sector, power
generation, transport, and industry will remain the three main
sources of CO, emissions over the next 50 years. Globally, the
projected energy sector emissions will fluctuate around the 40%
mark in 2050 (this matches the current figure), emissions from
the industry sector will decline and transport sector emissions
(ie, mobile sources) increase. Power generation, which
typically represent the bulk of large point sources, will account
for about 50% of total emissions by 20505.

storage capacity in geological formations and in the oceans are
discussed in detail in Chapters 5 and 6 respectively and are not

The results of applying the capture factors developed by
Toth and Rogner (2006) to the CO, emissions of the SRES
scenarios of Table 2.5 are presented in Table 2.6. Depending on
the scenario, between 30 and 60% of global power generation
emissions could be suitable for capture by 2050 and 30 to
40% of industry emissions could also be captured in that time
frame.

review of industrial boilers in selected regions. Capture factors
were established on the basis of installed capacity, fuel type,
unit size, and other technical parameters. Outside the energy
and industry sectors, there are only very limited prospects for
practical CO, capture because sources in the residential sectors
are small, dispersed, and often mobile, and contain only low

In the assessment of CO, capture, perhaps the most important
open question is what will happen in the transport sector over
the next few decades. If the above average increases in energy
use for transport projected by all models in all scenarios involve
traditional fossil-fuelled engine technologies, the capture and
storage of transport-related CO, will — though theoretically
possible -remain technically meaningless (excess weight,
on-board equipment, compression penalty, etc.). However,
depending on the penetration rate of hydrogen-based transport
technologies, it should be possible to retrofit CO,-emitting
hydrogen production facilities with CO, capture equipment.
The transport sector provides a huge potential for indirect CO,
capture but feasibility depends on future hydrogen production
technologies.

"As discussed in Chapter 5, the aim of geological storage is
to replicate the natural occurrence of deep subsurface fluids,
where they have been trapped for tens or hundreds of millions
of years. Due to the slow migration rates of subsurface fluids
observed in nature (often centimetres per year), and even
including scenarios where CO, leakage to the surface might
unexpectedly occur, CO, injected into the geological subsurface
will essentially remain geographically close to the location
where it is injected. Chapter 6 shows that CO, injected into
the ocean water column does not remain in a static location,
but will migrate at relatively rapid speed throughout the ocean
as dissolved CO, within the prevailing circulation of ocean
currents. So dissolved CO, in the water column will not remain
where it is injected in the immediate short term (i.e., a few years
to some centuries). Deep-ocean lakes of CO, will, in principle,
be more static geographically but will dissolve into the water

column over the course of a few years or centuries.

"various parts of the world for the geological storage of CO,.
Prospectivity is a term commonly used in explorations for any
geological resource, and in this case it applies to CO, storage
space. Prospectivity is a qualitative assessment of the likelihood
that a suitable storage location is present in a given area based
on the available information. By nature, it will change over
time and with new information. Estimates of prospectivity
are developed by examining data (if possible), examining
existing knowledge, applying established conceptual models
and, ideally, generating new conceptual models or applying an
analogue from a neighbouring basin or some other geologically
similar setting. The concept of prospectivity is often used when
it is too complex or technically impossible to assign numerical
estimates to the extent of a resource.

to include those basins that are world-class petroleum basins,

substantial volumes of hydrocarbons. It also includes areas
that are expected to have substantial storage potential. Areas of
prospective storage potential are basins that are minor petroleum

"2.4.3.1 Geological storage and source location matching
Chapter 5 includes detailed discussions of the geological
characteristics of storage sites. Before discussing the global
locations for geological storage opportunities, it is necessary
to describe some basic fundamentals of geological storage. The
world’s geological provinces can be allocated to a variety of
rock types, but the main ones relevant to geological storage are
sedimentary basins that have undergone only minor tectonic
deformation and are at least 1000 m thick with adequate
reservoir/seal pairs to allow for the injection and trapping of
CO,. The petroleum provinces of the world are a subset of the
sedimentary basins described above, and are considered to be
promising locations for the geological storage of CO, (Bradshaw
et al., 2002). These basins have adequate reservoir/seal pairs,
and suitable traps for hydrocarbons, whether liquids or gases.
The remaining geological provinces of the world can generally
be categorized as igneous (rocks formed from crystallization
of molten liquid) and metamorphic (pre-existing rocks formed
by chemical and physical alteration under the influence of heat,
pressure and chemically active fluids) provinces. These rock
types are commonly known as hard-rock provinces, and they
will not be favourable for CO, storage as they are generally not
porous and permeable and will therefore not readily transmit
fluids. More details on the suitability of sedimentary basins and
characterization of specific sites are provided in Chapter 5.

"provinces might have some local niche opportunities for CO,
storage, but at this stage they would not be considered suitable
for a conventional form of CO, storage. As Bradshaw and
Dance (2004) explain, this map is subject to significant caveats
and based on significant assumptions because of the data source
from which it was generated. However, it can be used as a
general (although not specific) guide at the global scale to the
location of areas that are likely to provide opportunities for the
geological storage of CO,. Due to the generalized manner in
which this map has been created, and the lack of specific or
hard data for each of the basins assessed, the ‘prospectivity’
levels assigned to each category have no meaningful correlative
statistical or probabilistic connotation. To achieve a numerical
analysis of risk or certainty would require specific information
about each and every basin assessed.

"ee OE II II J OI

Figure 2.5 shows the overlap of the sedimentary basins
that are prospective for CO, storage potential with the current
locations of large sources of stationary emissions (IEA GHG,
2002a). The map can be simplistically interpreted to identify
areas where large distances might be required to transport
emissions from any given source to a geological storage
location. It clearly shows areas with local geological storage
potential and low numbers of emission sites (for example,
South America) as well as areas with high numbers of emission
sites and few geological storage options in the vicinity (the
Indian sub-continent, for example). This map, however, does
not address the relative capacity of any of the given sites to
match either large emission sources or small storage capacities.
Neither does it address any of the technical uncertainties that
could exist at any of the storage sites, or the cost implications
for the emission sources of the nature of the emission plant
or the purity of the emission sources. Such issues of detailed
source-to-store matching are dealt with in Chapter 5.
"	Text
"Figures 2.6, 2.7 and 2.8 show the regional emission clusters
for twelve regions of the world and the available storage
opportunities within each region. They also compare the relative
ranking of the area of available prospective sedimentary basins
in a 300 km radius around emission clusters (Bradshaw and
Dance, 2004). The 300 km radius was selected because it was
considered useful as an indicator of likely transport distances
for potentially viable source-to-storage matches (see Chapter 5).
Although this data could suggest trends, such as high emissions
for China with a small area of prospective sedimentary basins,
or a large area of prospective sedimentary basins with low
emissions for the Middle East, it is premature to make too many
assumptions until detailed assessments are made in each region
as to the quality and viability of each sedimentary basin and
specific proposed sites. Each basin will have its own technical
peculiarities, and because the science of injection and storage of
very large volumes of CO, is still developing, it is premature at
this stage to make any substantive comments about the viability
of individual sedimentary basins unless there are detailed
data sets and assessments (see Chapter 5). These maps do,
however, indicate where such detailed geological assessments
will be required — China and India, for example — before a
comprehensive assessment can be made of the likely worldwide
impact of the geological storage of CO,. These maps also show
that CO, storage space is a resource, just like any other resource;
some regions will have many favourable opportunities, and
others will not be so well-endowed (Bradshaw and Dance,
2004).

Hydrogen might also be used in internal combustion engine

and Gordon, 2002), although efficiencies are likely to be less
than with fuel cells. In this case, the range between refuelling
would also be less than for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles with the
same performance (Ogden et al., 2004). For power generation
applications, gas turbines originally designed for natural gas
operation can be re-engineered to operate on hydrogen (Chiesa

The long-term trend has been towards the electrification of the

energy economy, and this trend is expected to continue (IPCC,
2000). To the extent that expanded electricity use is a substitute
for the direct use of fossil fuels (e.g., in transport, or for cooking
or heating applications in households), the result can be less CO,
emissions if the electricity is from carbon-free primary energy

in this way is likely to be less costly than hydrogen produced
from renewable or nuclear primary energy sources (Williams,
2003; NRC, 2004). It should be noted that this technology
can be utilized only if production sites are within a couple of
hundred kilometres of where the hydrogen will be used, since
cost-effective, long-distance hydrogen transport represents
a significant challenge. Producing hydrogen from fossil

a hydrogen economy based on carbon-free primary energy
sources through the establishment of a hydrogen utilization

electricity, most energy projections envision that the direct use

transport, for example, despite intensive developmental efforts,
battery-powered electric vehicles have not evolved beyond
niche markets because the challenges of high cost, heavy weight,
and long recharging times have not been overcome. Whilst the
prospects of current hybrid electric vehicles (which combine
fossil fuel and electric batteries) penetrating mass markets seem
good, these vehicles do not require charging from centralized
electrical grids. The successful development of ‘plug-in hybrids’
might lead to an expanded role for electricity in transport but
such vehicles would still require fuel as well as grid electricity.

Energy market applications for hydrogen include its
conversion to electricity electrochemically (in fuel cells) and
in combustion applications. Substituting hydrogen for fossil
fuel burning eliminates CO, emissions at the point of energy
use. Much of the interest in hydrogen market development
has focused on distributed stationary applications in buildings
and on transport. Fuel cells are one option for use in stationary
distributed energy systems at scales as small as apartment
buildings and even single-family residences (Lloyd, 1999).
In building applications, hydrogen could also be combusted
for heating and cooking (Ogden and Williams, 1989). In the
transport sector, the hydrogen fuel cell car is the focus of
intense development activity, with commercialization targeted
for the middle of the next decade by several major automobile
manufacturers (Burns et al., 2002). The main technological
obstacles to the widespread use of fuel cell vehicles are the
current high costs of the vehicles themselves and the bulkiness
of compressed gaseous hydrogen storage (the only fully proven
hydrogen storage technology), which restricts the range between
refuelling (NRC, 2004). However, the currently achievable
ranges might be acceptable to many consumers, even without
storage technology breakthroughs (Ogden et al., 2004).

"There is widespread industrial experience with the production
and distribution of hydrogen, mainly for the synthesis of
ammonia fertilizer and hydro-treatment in oil refineries. Current
global hydrogen production is 45 million t yr', the equivalent
to 1.4% of global primary energy use in 2000 (Simbeck, 2003).
Forty-eight per cent is produced from natural gas, 30% from
oil, 18% from coal, and 4% via electrolysis of water. Ammonia
production, which consumes about 100,000 MW, of hydrogen,
is growing by 2-4% per year. Oil refinery demand for hydrogen
is also increasing, largely because of the ongoing shift to
heavier crude oils and regulations limiting the sulphur content
of transport fuels. Most hydrogen is currently manufactured
via steam methane reforming (SMR), steam reforming of
naphtha, and the gasification of petroleum residues and coal.
The SMR option is generally favoured due to its lower capital
cost wherever natural gas is available at reasonable prices.
Nevertheless, there are currently about 75 modern commercial
gasification plants making about 20,000 MW, of hydrogen
from coal and oil refinery residues (NETL-DOE, 2002); these
are mostly ammonia fertilizer plants and hydrogen plants in
oil refineries in China, Europe, and North America. There are
currently over 16,000 km of hydrogen pipelines around the
world. Most are relatively short and located in industrial areas
for large customers who make chemicals, reduce metals, and
engage in the hydro-treatment of oil at refineries. The longest
pipeline currently in operation is 400 km long and is located in
a densely populated area of Europe, running from Antwerp to
northern France. The pipeline operates at a pressure of about 60
atmospheres (Simbeck, 2004).

There is considerable activity worldwide relating to the
manufacture of Fischer-Tropsch liquids from stranded natural
gas supplies. The first major gas to liquids plant, producing
12,500 barrels per day, was built in Malaysia in 1993. Several
projects are underway to make Fischer-Tropsch liquid fuels
from natural gas in Qatar at plant capacities ranging from 30,000
to 140,000 barrels per day. Although gas to liquids projects do
not typically produce concentrated by-product streams of CO,,
synthetic fuel projects using synthesis gas derived from coal (or
other solid feedstocks such as biomass or petroleum residuals)
via gasification could produce large streams of concentrated
CO, that are good candidates for capture and storage. At Sasol in
South Africa, coal containing some 20 million tonnes of carbon
is consumed annually in the manufacture of synthetic fuels and
chemicals. About 32% of the carbon ends up in the products,
40% is vented as CO, in dilute streams, and 28% is released
as nearly pure CO, at a rate of about 20 million tonnes of CO,
per year. In addition, since 2000, 1.5 million tonnes per year of
CO, by-product from synthetic methane production at a coal
gasification plant in North Dakota (United States) have been
captured and transported 300 km by pipeline to the Weyburn oil
field in Saskatchewan (Canada), where it is used for enhanced oil
recovery (see Chapter 5 for more details). Coal-based synthetic
fuel plants being planned or considered in China include six
600,000 t yr! methanol plants, two 800,000 t yr! dimethyl] ether
plants, and two or more large Fischer-Tropsch liquids plants’.
In the United States, the Department of Energy is supporting a
demonstration project in Pennsylvania to make 5,000 barrels/
day of Fischer-Tropsch liquids plus 41 MW, of electricity from

low-quality coal.

A key issue posed by biomass energy production, both with

biomass energy production plants are much smaller than fossil
fuel power plants; typical plant capacities are about 30 MW.,
with CO, emissions of less than 0.2 MtCO, per year. The size of
these biomass energy production plants reflects the availability
and dispersed nature of current biomass supplies, which are
mainly crop and forestry residues.

Bioethanol is the main biofuel being produced today. Currently,
the two largest producers of bioethanol are the USA and Brazil.
The USA produced 11 billion litres in 2003, nearly double the
capacity in 1995. Production is expected to continue to rise
because of government incentives. Brazilian production was
over 14 billion litres per year in 2003/2004, similar to the level
in 1997/1998 (Mdllersten et al., 2003). Bioethanol is used

as a partial replacement for petroleum-based fuels (the level of

Larger plants could also be favoured if there were a shift
from the utilization of biomass residues to dedicated energy
crops. Several studies have assessed the likely size of future
biomass energy production plants, but these studies conflict
when it comes to the scale issue. One study, cited in Audus and
Freund (2004), surveyed 28 favoured sites using woody biomass
crops in Spain and concluded that the average appropriate scale
would be in the range 30 to 70 MW.,. This figure is based on the
fact that transport distances longer than the assumed maximum
of 40 km would render larger plants uneconomic. In contrast,
another study based on dedicated energy crops in Brazil and
the United States estimated that economies of scale outweigh
the extra costs of transporting biomass over long distances.
This study found that plant capacities of hundreds of MW, were
feasible (Marrison and Larson, 1995). Other studies have come
up with similar findings (Dornburg and Faaij, 2001; Hamelinck
and Faaij, 2002). A recent study analyzed a variety of options

"The prospects for biomass energy production with CO,
capture and storage might be improved in the future if economies
of scale in energy production and/or CO, capture and storage
can be realized. If, for instance, a CO, pipeline network is
established in a country or region, then small CO, emission
sources (including those from biomass energy plants) could be
added to any nearby CO, pipelines if it is economically viable to
do so. A second possibility is that existing large fossil fuel plants
with CO, capture and storage represent an opportunity for the
co-processing of biomass. Co-processing biomass at coal power
plants already takes place in a number of countries. However,
it must be noted that if biomass is co-processed with a fossil
fuel, these plants do not represent new large-scale emissions
sources. A third possibility is to build larger biomass energy
production plants than the plants typically in place at present.
Larger biomass energy production plants have been built or are
being planned in a number of countries, typically those with
extensive biomass resources. For example, Sweden already has
seven combined heat and power plants using biomass at pulp
mills, with each plant producing around 130 MW, equivalent.
The size of biomass energy production plants depends on local
circumstances, in particular the availability of concentrated
biomass sources; pulp mills and sugar processing plants offer
concentrated sources of this kind.

New or improved methods of CO, capture, combined with
advanced power systems and industrial process designs, can
significantly reduce CO, capture costs and associated energy
requirements. While there is considerable uncertainty about the
magnitude and timing of future cost reductions, this assessment
suggests that improvements to commercial technologies can
reduce CO, capture costs by at least 20-30% over approximately
the next decade, while new technologies under development
promise more substantial cost reductions. Realization of future
cost reductions, however, will require deployment and adoption
of commercial technologies in the marketplace as well as
sustained R&D.

For all of the aforementioned applications, we reviewed
recent studies of the performance and cost of commercial or
near-commercial technologies, as well as that of newer CO,
capture concepts that are the subject of intense R&D efforts
worldwide. For power plants, current commercial CO, capture
systems can reduce CO, emissions by 80-90% kWh"" (85-
95% capture efficiency). Across all plant types the cost of
electricity production (COE) increases by 12-36 US$ MWh""!
(US$ 0.012-0.036 kWh"") over a similar type of plant without
capture, corresponding to a 40-85% increase for a supercritical

"The purpose of CO, capture is to produce a concentrated stream
that can be readily transported to a CO, storage site. CO, capture
and storage is most applicable to large, centralized sources
like power plants and large industries. Capture technologies
also open the way for large-scale production of low-carbon or
carbon-free electricity and fuels for transportation, as well as
for small-scale or distributed applications. The energy required
to operate CO, capture systems reduces the overall efficiency of
power generation or other processes, leading to increased fuel
requirements, solid wastes and environmental impacts relative
to the same type of base plant without capture. However, as
more efficient plants with capture become available and replace
many of the older less efficient plants now in service, the
net impacts will be compatible with clean air emission goals
for fossil fuel use. Minimization of energy requirements for
capture, together with improvements in the efficiency of energy
conversion processes will continue to be high priorities for
future technology development in order to minimize overall
environmental impacts and cost.

At present, CO, is routinely separated at some large
industrial plants such as natural gas processing and ammonia
production facilities, although these plants remove CO, to
meet process demands and not for storage. CO, capture also
has been applied to several small power plants. However,
there have been no applications at large-scale power plants of
several hundred megawatts, the major source of current and
projected CO, emissions. There are three main approaches to
CO, capture, for industrial and power plant applications. Post-
combustion systems separate CO, from the flue gases produced
by combustion of a primary fuel (coal, natural gas, oil or
biomass) in air. Oxy-fuel combustion uses oxygen instead of
air for combustion, producing a flue gas that is mainly H,O and
CO, and which is readily captured. This is an option still under
development. Pre-combustion systems process the primary fuel
in a reactor to produce separate streams of CO, for storage and
H, which is used as a fuel. Other industrial processes, including
processes for the production of low-carbon or carbon-free fuels,
employ one or more of these same basic capture methods. The
monitoring, risk and legal aspects associated with CO, capture
systems appear to present no new challenges, as they are all
elements of long-standing health, safety and environmental
control practice in industry.

the COE for fossil fuel plants with capture, ranges from 43-86
US$ MWh'', with the cost per tonne of CO, ranging from 11-
57 US$tCO, captured or 13-74 US$/tCO, avoided (depending
on plant type, size, fuel type and a host of other factors). These
costs include CO, compression but not additional transport
and storage costs. NGCC systems typically have a lower COE
than new PC and IGCC plants (with or without capture) for
gas prices below about 4 US$ GJ'. Most studies indicate that
IGCC plants are slightly more costly without capture and
slightly less costly with capture than similarly sized PC plants,
but the differences in cost for plants with CO, capture can vary
with coal type and other local factors. The lowest CO, capture
costs (averaging about 12 US$/t CO, captured or 15 US$/tCO,
avoided) were found for industrial processes such as hydrogen
production plants that produce concentrated CO, streams as part
of the current production process; such industrial processes may
represent some of the earliest opportunities for CO, Capture
and Storage (CCS). In all cases, CO, capture costs are highly
dependent upon technical, economic and financial factors
related to the design and operation of the production process
or power system of interest, as well as the design and operation
of the CO, capture technology employed. Thus, comparisons
of alternative technologies, or the use of CCS cost estimates,

require a specific context to be meaningful.

The general scheme of Figure 3.2 governs many important
CO, capture systems, including leading commercial options like
chemical absorption and physical absorption and adsorption.
Other emerging processes based on new liquid sorbents, or
new solid regenerable sorbents are being developed with the
aim of overcoming the limitations of the existing systems.
One common problem of these CO, capture systems is that
the flow of sorbent between the vessels of Figure 3.2a is large
because it has to match the huge flow of CO, being processed
in the power plant. Therefore, equipment sizes and the energy
required for sorbent regeneration are large and tend to translate
into an important efficiency penalty and added cost. Also, in
systems using expensive sorbent materials there is always a
danger of escalating cost related to the purchase of the sorbent
and the disposal of sorbent residues. Good sorbent performance
under high CO, loading in many repetitive cycles is obviously
a necessary condition in these CO, capture systems.

Pre-combustion capture involves reacting a fuel with oxygen
or air and/or steam to give mainly a ‘synthesis gas (syngas)’ or
‘fuel gas’ composed of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The
carbon monoxide is reacted with steam in a catalytic reactor,
called a shift converter, to give CO, and more hydrogen. CO,
is then separated, usually by a physical or chemical absorption
process, resulting in a hydrogen-rich fuel which can be used
in many applications, such as boilers, furnaces, gas turbines,
engines and fuel cells. These systems are considered to be
strategically important (see Section 3.5) but the power plant
systems of reference today are 4 GW, of both oil and coal-based,
integrated gasification combined cycles (IGCC) which are
around 0.1% of total installed capacity worldwide (3719 GW.;
IEA WEO, 2004). Other reference systems for the application
of pre-combustion capture include substantially more capacity
than that identified above for IGCC in existing natural gas, oil
and coal-based syngas/hydrogen production facilities and other
types of industrial systems described in more detail in Sections
3.2 and 3.5.

The separation is achieved by passing the CO,-containing gas
in intimate contact with a liquid absorbent or solid sorbent that
is capable of capturing the CO, In the general scheme of Figure
3.2a, the sorbent loaded with the captured CO, is transported to
a different vessel, where it releases the CO, (regeneration) after
being heated, after a pressure decrease or after any other change
in the conditions around the sorbent. The sorbent resulting after
the regeneration step is sent back to capture more CO, in acyclic
process. In some variants of this scheme the sorbent is a solid
and does not circulate between vessels because the sorption
and regeneration are achieved by cyclic changes (in pressure
or temperature) in the vessel where the sorbent is contained. A
make-up flow of fresh sorbent is always required to compensate
for the natural decay of activity and/or sorbent losses. In some
situations, the sorbent may be a solid oxide which reacts in a
vessel with fossil fuel or biomass producing heat and mainly
CO, (see Section 3.4.6). The spent sorbent is then circulated to a
second vessel where it is re-oxidized in air for reuse with some
loss and make up of fresh sorbent.

An important and growing trend is the use of new iron-
making processes, which can use lower grade coal than the
coking coals required for blast furnace operation. A good
example is the COREX process (von Bogdandy et. al, 1989),
which produces a large additional quantity of N,-free fuel gas
which can be used in a secondary operation to convert iron
ore to iron. Complete CO, capture from this process should be
possible with this arrangement since the CO, and H,O present
in the COREX top gas must be removed to allow the CO plus
H, to be heated and used to reduce iron oxide to iron in the
secondary shaft kiln. This process will produce a combination
of molten iron and iron with high recovery of CO, derived
from the coal feed to the COREX process.

"The iron and steel industry is the largest energy-consuming
manufacturing sector in the world, accounting for 10-15%
of total industrial energy consumption (IEA GHG, 2000a).
Associated CO, emissions were estimated at 1442 MtCO, in
1995. Two types of iron- and steel-making technologies are in
operation today. The integrated steel plant has a typical capacity
of 3-5 Mtonnes yr' of steel and uses coal as its basic fuel with,
in many cases, additional natural gas and oil. The mini-mill
uses electric arc furnaces to melt scrap with a typical output of 1
Mtonnes yr! of steel and an electrical consumption of 300-350
kWh tonne"" steel. Increasingly mini-mills blend direct-reduced
iron (DRI) with scrap to increase steel quality. The production
of direct-reduced iron involves reaction of high oxygen content
iron ore with H, and CO to form reduced iron plus H,O and
CO,. As a result, many of the direct reduction iron processes

Whilst accurate figures are published for annual worldwide
natural gas production (BP, 2004), none seem to be published
on how much of that gas may contain CO,. Nevertheless, a
reasonable assumption is that about half of raw natural gas
production contains CO, at concentrations averaging at least
4% by volume. These figures can be used to illustrate the

At present, CO, is not captured from cement plants, but

possibilities do exist. The concentration of CO, in the flue gases
is between 15-30% by volume, which is higher than in flue
gases from power and heat production (3-15% by volume). So,
in principle, the post-combustion technologies for CO, capture
described in Section 3.3 could be applied to cement production
plants, but would require the additional generation of steam in
a cement plant to regenerate the solvent used to capture CO,.
Oxy-fuel combustion capture systems may also become a
promising technique to recover CO, (IEA GHG, 1999). Another
emerging option would be the use of calcium sorbents for CO,
capture (see Sections 3.3.3.4 and 3.5.3.5) as calcium carbonate
(limestone) is a raw material already used in cement plants. All
of these capture techniques could be applied to retrofit, or new

A typical modern plant will use the amine solvent process to

CO, produced in modern plants from natural gas is about 1.27

it should be noted that this is not all available for storage, as
ammonia plants are frequently combined with urea plants,
which are capable of utilizing 70-90% of the CO,. About 0.7

"We have reviewed processes — current and potential - that may be
used to separate CO, in the course of producing another product.
One of these processes, natural gas sweetening, is already being
used in two industrial plants to capture and store about 2 MtCO,

ammonia production, pure CO, is already being separated. Over
7 MtCO, yr' captured from both natural gas sweetening and

However, comparative assessment studies (Hendriks, 1994;

absorption processes based on chemical solvents are currently
the preferred option for post-combustion CO, capture. At this

Flue gas flow rate - The flue gas flow rate will determine the
size of the absorber and the absorber represents a sizeable
contribution to the overall cost.

CO, content in flue gas - Since flue gas is usually at
atmospheric pressure, the partial pressure of CO, will be
as low as 3-15 kPa. Under these low CO, partial pressure
conditions, aqueous amines (chemical solvents) are the most
suitable absorption solvents (Kohl and Nielsen, 1997).

CO, removal - In practice, typical CO, recoveries are between
80% and 95%. The exact recovery choice is an economic
trade-off, a higher recovery will lead to a taller absorption
column, higher energy penalties and hence increased costs.
Solvent flow rate - The solvent flow rate will determine
the size of most equipment apart from the absorber. For a
given solvent, the flow rate will be fixed by the previous
parameters and also the chosen CO, concentrations within
the lean and the rich solutions.

Energy requirement - The energy consumption of the process
is the sum of the thermal energy needed to regenerate the
solvents and the electrical energy required to operate liquid
pumps and the flue gas blower or fan. Energy is also required
to compress the CO, recovered to the final pressure required
for transport and storage.

"Absorption processes in post-combustion capture make use of
the reversible nature of the chemical reaction of an aqueous
alkaline solvent, usually an amine, with an acid or sour gas.
The process flow diagram of a commercial absorption system is
presented in Figure 3.4. After cooling the flue gas, it is brought
into contact with the solvent in the absorber. A blower is
required to overcome the pressure drop through the absorber. At
absorber temperatures typically between 40 and 60°C, CO, is
bound by the chemical solvent in the absorber. The flue gas then
undergoes a water wash section to balance water in the system
and to remove any solvent droplets or solvent vapour carried
over, and then it leaves the absorber. It is possible to reduce
CO, concentration in the exit gas down to very low values, as
a result of the chemical reaction in the solvent, but lower exit
concentrations tend to increase the height of the absorption
vessel. The ‘rich’ solvent, which contains the chemically bound
CO, is then pumped to the top of a stripper (or regeneration
vessel), via a heat exchanger. The regeneration of the chemical
solvent is carried out in the stripper at elevated temperatures
(100°C-140°C) and pressures not very much higher than
atmospheric pressure. Heat is supplied to the reboiler to
maintain the regeneration conditions. This leads to a thermal
energy penalty as a result of heating up the solvent, providing
the required desorption heat for removing the chemically
bound CO, and for steam production which acts as a stripping
gas. Steam is recovered in the condenser and fed back to the
stripper, whereas the CO, product gas leaves the stripper. The
‘lean’ solvent, containing far less CO, is then pumped back to
the absorber via the lean-rich heat exchanger and a cooler to
bring it down to the absorber temperature level.

Since combustion flue gases are generally at atmospheric
pressure and the CO, is diluted, the CO, partial pressure is
very low. Also, flue gas contains oxygen and other impurities;
therefore an important characteristic of an absorption process is
in the proper choice of solvent for the given process duty. High
CO, loading and low heat of desorption energy are essential
for atmospheric flue gas CO, recovery. The solvents must also
have low byproduct formation and low decomposition rates, to
maintain solvent performance and to limit the amount of waste
materials produced. The important effect of other contaminants
on the solvent is discussed in Section 3.3.2.2.

contain other acid gas components such as NO, and SO,. Flue
gases from natural gas combustion will normally only contain
NO.. These acidic gas components will, similar to CO,, have
a chemical interaction with the alkaline solvent. This is not
desirable as the irreversible nature of this interaction leads to
the formation of heat stable salts and hence a loss in absorption
capacity of the solvent and the risk of formation of solids in the

levels are too high. Often the requirements of other flue gas

Integration of the absorption process with an existing power
plant will require modifications of the low-pressure part of the
steam cycle, as a sizeable fraction of the steam will be extracted
and hence will not be available to produce power (Nsakala et

the required modifications, small back-pressure steam turbines
using medium pressure steam to drive the flue gas fan and boiler
feed water pumps can be used. The steam is then condensed in
the reboiler (Mimura et al., 1999). Furthermore, in power plants
based on steam cycles more than 50% thermal energy in the
steam cycle is disposed off in the steam condenser. If the steam
cycle system and CO, recovery can be integrated, part of the
waste heat disposed by the steam condenser can be utilized for

"The allowable SO, content in the flue gas is primarily
determined by the cost of the solvent - as this is consumed
by reaction with SO,. SO, concentrations in the flue gas are
typically around 300- 5000 ppm. Commercially available
SO,-removal plants will remove up to 98-99%. Amines are
relatively cheap chemicals, but even cheap solvents like MEA
(with a price around 1.25 US$ kg"" (Rao and Rubin, 2002) may
require SO, concentrations of around 10 ppm, to keep solvent
consumption (around 1.6 kg of MEA/tCO, separated) and make
up costs at reasonable values, which often means that additional
flue gas desulphurization is needed. The optimal SO, content,
before the CO, absorption process is a cost trade-off between
CO,-solvent consumption and SO,-removal costs. For the
Kerr-Mcgee/ABB Lummus Crest Technology, SO,-removal is
typically not justified for SO, levels below 50 ppm (Barchas
and Davis, 1992). For the Fluor Daniel Econamine FG process a
maximum of 10 ppm SO, content is generally set as the feed
gas specification (Sander and Mariz, 1992). This can be met
by using alkaline salt solutions in a spray scrubber (Chapel et
al., 1999). A SO, scrubber might also double as a direct contact
cooler to cool down the flue gas

As a result of decomposition of amines, effluents will be
created, particularly ammonia and heat-stable salts. Rao and
Rubin (2002) have estimated these emissions for an MEA-based
process based on limited data. In such processes, heat stable
salts (solvent decomposition products, corrosion products etc.)
are removed from the solution in a reclaimer and a waste stream
is created and is disposed of using normal HSE (Health, Safety
and Environmental) practices. In some cases, these reclaimer
bottoms may be classified as a hazardous waste, requiring
special handling (Rao and Rubin, 2002). Also a particle filter and
carbon filter is normally installed in the solvent circuit to remove
byproducts. Finally, some solvent material will be lost to the
environment through evaporation and carry over in the absorber,
which is accounted for in the solvent consumption. It is expected
that acid gases other than CO,,, which are still present in the flue
gas (SO, and NO,) will also be absorbed in the solution. This
will lower the concentration of these components further and
even the net emissions in some cases depending on the amount
of additional energy use for CO, capture (see Tables 3.4 and 3.5).
As SO,-removal prior to CO,-removal is very likely in coal-fired
plants, this will lead to the production of a waste or byproduct
stream containing gypsum and water from the FGD unit.

The efficiencies are based on a standard set of plant design criteria IEA GHG, 2004).

The coal steam cycle plants, including the post-combustion capture and oxy-fuel plants, are based on ultra-supercritical steam (29MPa, 600C
superheat, 620C reheat). The IGCC and natural gas pre- and post-combustion capture plants are based on GE 9FA gas turbine combined
cycles. The natural gas oxy-fuel plant is based on a CO, recycle gas turbine, as shown in Figure 3.10, with different operating pressures and
temperatures but similar mechanical design criteria to that of the 9FA.

Data are presented for two types of post-combustion capture solvent: MEA (Fluor plant designs) and KS-1 (MHI plant designs). The solvent
desorption heat consumptions are 3.2 and 2.7 MJ/kgCO, captured respectively for the coal plants and 3.7 and 2.7 MJ kg""! for the natural gas
plants.

Data are presented for IGCC plants based on two types of gasifier: the Shell dry feed/heat recovery boiler type and the GE (formerly Texaco)
slurry feed water quench type.

The natural gas pre-combustion capture plant is based on partial oxidation using oxygen.

The oxy-fuel plants include cryogenic removal of some of the impurities from the CO, during compression. Electricity consumption fot
oxygen production by cryogenic distillation of air is 200 kWh/ tO, at atmospheric pressure for the coal plant and 320 kWh/ tO, at 40 bar fot
the natural gas plant. Oxygen production in the IGCC and natural gas pre-combustion capture plants is partially integrated with the gas turbine
compressor, so comparable data cannot be provided for these plants.

The percentage CO, capture is 85-90% for all plants except the natural gas oxy-fuel plant which has an inherently higher percentage capture
of 97%.

a.

The increase in fuel required to produce a kWh of electricity is calculated by comparing the same type of plant with and without capture. The
increase in fuel consumption depends on the type of baseline plant without capture. For example, the increase in energy consumption for a GE
IGCC plant with capture compared to a coal steam cycle baseline plant without capture would be 40% as opposed to the lower value show1
in the figure that was calculated relative to the same type of baseline plant without capture.

The direct energy consumptions for CO, separation are lower for pre-combustion capture than for post-combustion capture, because CO, i
removed from a more concentrated, higher pressure gas, so a physical rather than a chemical solvent can be used.

The ‘Fuel gas processing and related impacts’ category for IGCC includes shift conversion of the fuel gas and the effects on the gas turbine
combined cycle of removal of CO, from the fuel gas and use of hydrogen as a fuel instead of syngas. For natural gas pre-combustion capturc
this category also includes partial oxidation/steam reforming of the natural gas.

The energy consumption for CO, compression is lower in pre-combustion capture than in post-combustion capture because some of the CO
leaves the separation unit at elevated pressure.

The energy consumption for CO, compression in the oxy-fuel processes depends on the composition of the extracted product, namely 75%
by volume in the coal-fired plant and 93% by volume in the gas fired plant. Impurities are cryogenically removed from the CO, durin;
compression, to give a final CO, purity of 96% by volume. The energy consumption of the cryogenic CO, separation unit is included in the
CO, compression power consumption.

The ‘Oxygen production and power plant impacts’ category for oxy-fuel processes includes the power consumption for oxygen productior
and the impacts of CO, capture on the rest of the power plant, that is excluding CO, compression and purification. In the coal-fired oxy-fue
plant, the efficiency of the rest of the power plant increases slightly, for example due to the absence of a flue gas desulphurization (FGD
unit. The efficiency of the rest of the gas fired oxy-fuel plant decreases because of the change of working fluid in the power cycle from air t
recycled flue gas.

of operational problems occurring in conventional solvent
absorption systems (see Section 3.3.2.1) where gas and liquid
flows are in direct contact. Operational problems avoided
include foaming, flooding entrainment and channelling, and
result in the free choice of the gas and liquid flow rates and
a fixed interface for mass transfer in the membrane/solvent

in smaller equipment sizes with capital cost reductions. The

Membrane processes are used commercially for CO, removal
from natural gas at high pressure and at high CO, concentration

difference provides a low driving force for gas separation.
The removal of carbon dioxide using commercially available
polymeric gas separation membranes results in higher energy
penalties on the power generation efficiency compared to a
standard chemical absorption process (Herzog et al., 1991, Van
der Sluijs et al., 1992 and Feron, 1994). Also, the maximum

The membrane option currently receiving the most attention
is a hybrid membrane — absorbent (or solvent) system. These
systems are being developed for flue gas CO, recovery.
Membrane/solvent systems employ membranes to provide
a very high surface area to volume ratio for mass exchange
between a gas stream and a solvent resulting in a very compact
system. This results in a membrane contactor system in which
the membrane forms a gas permeable barrier between a liquid
and a gaseous phase. In general, the membrane is not involved
in the separation process. In the case of porous membranes,
gaseous components diffuse through the pores and are absorbed
by the liquid; in cases of non-porous membranes they dissolve in
the membrane and diffuse through the membrane. The contact
surface area between gas and liquid phase is maintained by the
membrane and is independent of the gas and liquid flow rate.
The selectivity of the partition is primarily determined by the
absorbent (solvent). Absorption in the liquid phase is determined
either by physical partition or by a chemical reaction.

"Research and development efforts have also been reported
in the area of facilitated transport membranes. Facilitated
transport membranes rely on the formation of complexes
or reversible chemical reactions of components present in a
gas stream with compounds present in the membrane. These
complexes or reaction products are then transported through the
membrane. Although solution and diffusion still play a role in
the transport mechanism, the essential element is the specific
chemical interaction of a gas component with a compound in
the membrane, the so-called carrier. Like other pressure driven
membrane processes, the driving force for the separation
comes from a difference in partial pressure of the component
to be transported. An important class of facilitated transport
membranes is the so-called supported liquid membrane in which
the carrier is dissolved into a liquid contained in a membrane.
For CO, separations, carbonates, amines and molten salt
hydrates have been suggested as carriers (Feron, 1992). Porous
membranes and ion-exchange membranes have been employed
as the support. Until now, supported liquid membranes have
only been studied on a laboratory scale. Practical problems
associated with supported liquid membranes are membrane
stability and liquid volatility. Furthermore, the selectivity for a
gas decreases with increasing partial pressure on the feed side.
This is a result of saturation of the carrier in the liquid. Also, as
the total feed pressure is increased, the permeation of unwanted
components is increased. This also results in a decrease in
selectivity. Finally, selectivity is also reduced by a reduction in
membrane thickness. Recent development work has focused on

purposes are sodium and potassium oxides and carbonates (to

Li-based and CaO-based sorbents are suitable candidates. The
use of lithium-containing compounds (lithium, lithium-zirconia
and lithium-silica oxides) in a carbonation-calcination cycle,
was first investigated in Japan (Nakagawa and Ohashi, 1998).
The reported performance of these sorbents is very good, with
very high reactivity in a wide range of temperatures below
700°C, rapid regeneration at higher temperatures and durability
in repeated capture-regeneration cycles. This is essential

because lithium is an intrinsically expensive material.

development of these systems is obviously the sorbent itself,

"The use of CaO as a regenerable CO, sorbent has been
proposed in several processes dating back to the 19"" century.
The carbonation reaction of CaO to separate CO, from hot gases
(T > 600°C) is very fast and the regeneration of the sorbent
by calcining the CaCO, into CaO and pure CO, is favoured
at T > 900°C (at a partial pressure of CO, of 0. 1 MPa). The
basic separation principle using this carbonation- calcination
cycle was successfully tested in a pilot plant (40 tonne d'') for
the development of the Acceptor Coal Gasification Process
(Curran et al., 1967) using two interconnected fluidized beds.
The use of the above cycle for a post-combustion system
was first proposed by Shimizu et al. (1999) and involved the
regeneration of the sorbent in a fluidized bed, firing part of
the fuel with O,/CO, mixtures (see also Section 3.4.2). The
effective capture of CO, by CaO has been demonstrated in
a small pilot fluidized bed (Abanades ef al., 2004a). Other
combustion cycles incorporating capture of CO, with CaO
that might not need O, are being developed, including one that
works at high pressures with simultaneous capture of CO, and

is that natural sorbents (limestones and dolomites) deactivate
rapidly, and a large make-up flow of sorbent (of the order of
the mass flow of fuel entering the plant) is required to maintain
the activity in the capture-regeneration loop (Abanades et al.,

sorbents, may lead to the use of more energy efficient post-
combustion capture systems. However, all these novel concepts
still need to prove their lower costs and reliability of operation
on a commercial scale. The same considerations also apply to
other advanced CO, capture concepts with oxy-fuel combustion
or pre-combustion capture reviewed in the following sections of
this chapter. It is generally not yet clear which of these emerging
technologies, if any, will succeed as the dominant commercial
technology for energy systems incorporating CO, capture.

Although elements of oxy-fuel combustion technologies
are in use in the aluminium, iron and steel and glass melting
industries today, oxy-fuel technologies for CO, capture have
yet to be deployed on a commercial scale. Therefore, the first
classification between existing technologies and emerging
technologies adopted in post-combustion (Section 3.3) and
pre-combustion (Section 3.5) is not followed in this section.
However, it is important to emphasize that the key separation
step in most oxy-fuel capture systems (O, from air) is an
‘existing technology’ (see Section 3.4.5). Current methods
of oxygen production by air separation comprise cryogenic
distillation, adsorption using multi-bed pressure swing units and
polymeric membranes. For oxy-fuel conversions requiring less
than 200 tO, d', the adsorption system will be economic. For
all the larger applications, which include power station boilers,
cryogenic air separation is the economic solution (Wilkinson et
al., 2003a).

For the combustion of pulverized coal, other pilot-scale tests
by Croiset and Thambimuthu (2000) have reported that the flame
temperature and heat capacity of gases to match fuel burning in
air occurs when the feed gas used in oxy-fuel combustion has
a composition of approximately 35% by volume O, and 65%
by volume of dry recycled CO, (c.f. 21% by volume O, and
the rest nitrogen in air). In practice, the presence of inerts such
as ash and inorganic components in the coal, the specific fuel
composition and moisture in the recycled gas stream and the
coal feed will result in minor adjustments to this feed mixture
composition to keep the flame temperature at a value similar to

As noted above for pulverized coal, oil, natural gas and
biomass combustion, fluidized beds could also be fired with
O, instead of air to supply heat for the steam cycle. The
intense solid mixing in a fluidized bed combustion system
can provide very good temperature control even in highly
exothermic conditions, thereby minimizing the need for flue
gas recycling. In principle, a variety of commercial designs for
fluidized combustion boilers exist that could be retrofitted for
oxygen firing. A circulating fluidized bed combustor with O,
firing was proposed by Shimizu er al. (1999) to generate the
heat required for the calcination of CaCO, (see also Section
3.3.3.4). More recently, plans for pilot testing of an oxy-fired
circulating fluidized bed boiler have been published by Nsakala

temperature gas purification step prior to CO, compression

conventional selective catalytic reduction for NO, removal and
flue gas desulphurization to purify the gas, a practice typically
adopted in conventional air-blown combustion processes (see
Figure 3.3). The overall reduction in flow volumes, equipment
scale and simplification of gas purification steps will thus have
the benefit of reducing both capital and operating costs of

At conditions that match O,/CO, recycle combustion to fuel
burning in air, coal burning is reported to be complete (Croiset
and Thambimuthu, 2000), with operation of the process at
excess O, levels in the flue gas as low as 1-3% by volume O,,
producing a flue gas stream of 95-98% by volume dry CO, (the
rest being excess O,, NO,, SO, and argon) when a very high
purity O, stream is used in the combustion process with zero
leakage of ambient air into the system. No differences were
detected in the fly ash formation behaviour in the combustor or
SO, emissions compared to conventional air firing conditions.
For NO, on the other hand, emissions were lower due to zero
thermal NO, formation from the absence of nitrogen in the
feed gas - with the partial recycling of NO, also reducing the
formation and net emissions originating from the fuel bound
nitrogen. Other studies have demonstrated that the level of NO,
reduction is as high as 75% compared to coal burning in air
(Chatel-Pelage er al., 2003). Similar data for natural gas burning
in O,/CO, recycle mixtures report zero thermal NO, emissions
in the absence of air leakage into the boiler, with trace amounts
produced as thermal NO, when residual nitrogen is present in
the natural gas feed (Tan et al., 2002).

The overall heat transfer is improved in oxy-fuel firing

together with the recycle of hot flue gas, increase the boiler

"It has been reported (Wilkinson ef al., 2003b) that the
application of oxy-fuel technology for the retrofit of power
plant boilers and a range of refinery heaters in a refinery
complex (Grangemouth refinery in Scotland) is technically
feasible at a competitive cost compared to other types of
CO, capture technologies. In this case, the existing boiler is
adapted to allow combustion of refinery gas and fuel oil with
highly enriched oxygen and with partial flue gas recycling for
temperature control. Oxy-fuel boiler conversions only needed
minor burner modifications, a new O, injection system and
controls, and a new flue gas recycle line with a separate blower.
These are cheap and relatively simple modifications and result
in an increase in boiler/heater thermal efficiency due to the
recycle of hot gas. Modifications to a coal-fired boiler are more
complex. In this study, it was found to be more economic to
design the air separation units for only 95% O, purity instead
of 99.5% to comply with practical levels of air leakage into
boilers and to separate the associated argon and nitrogen in
the CO, inert gas removal system to produce a purity of CO,
suitable for geological storage. After conversion of the boiler,
the CO, concentration in the flue gas increases from 17 to 60%
while the water content increases from 10 to 30%. Impurities
(SO_, NO,) and gases (excess O,, N,, argon) representing about
10% of the stream are separated from CO, at low temperature
(-55°C). After cooling, compression and drying of the separated
or non-recycled flue gas, the product for storage comprises
96% CO, contaminated with 2% N,, 1% argon and less than
1% O, and SO,. Production of ultra-pure CO, for storage would
also be possible if distillation steps are added to the separation

Possible metal oxides are some oxides of common transition-
state metals, such as iron, nickel, copper and manganese (Zafar
et al., 2005). The metal/metal oxide may be present in various
forms, but most studies so far have assumed the use of particles
with diameter 100-500 tum. In order to move particles between
the two reactors, the particles are fluidized. This method also
ensures efficient heat and mass transfer between the gases and
the particles. A critical issue is the long-term mechanical and
chemical stability of the particles that have to undergo repeated
cycles of oxidation and reduction, to minimize the make-up
requirement. When a chemical looping cycle is used in a gas
turbine cycle, the mechanical strength for crushing and the
filtration system is important to avoid damaging carry-over to
the turbine.

"Oxy-fuel combustion applied to furnaces, process heaters,
boilers and power generation systems is feasible since no
technical barriers for its implementation have been identified.
Early use of this capture technology is likely to address
applications involving indirect heating in power generation and
process heating (Section 3.4.2), since these options involve the
minimal modification of technologies and infrastructure that
have hitherto been already developed for the combustion of
hydrocarbon or carbonaceous fuels in air. However, several novel
applications proposed for direct heating in steam turbine cycles
or gas turbine cycles for power generation (Sections 3.4.3 and
3.4.4) still require the development of new components such as
oxy-fuel combustors, higher temperature tolerant components
such as CO,- and H,O-based turbines with blade cooling, CO,
compressors and high temperature ion transport membranes for
oxygen separation. As for Chemical Looping Combustion, it is
currently still at an early stage of development.

"Originally proposed by Richter and Knoche (1983) and with
subsequent significant contributions by Ishida and Jin (1994), the
main idea of chemical looping combustion is to split combustion
of a hydrocarbon or carbonaceous fuel into separate oxidation
and reduction reactions by introducing a suitable metal oxide
as an oxygen carrier to circulate between two reactors (Figure
3.13). Separation of oxygen from air is accomplished by fixing
the oxygen as a metal oxide. No air separation plant is required.
The reaction between fuel and oxygen is accomplished in a
second reactor by the release of oxygen from the metal oxide in
a reducing atmosphere caused by the presence of a hydrocarbon
or carbonaceous fuel. The recycle rate of the solid material
between the two reactors and the average solids residence time
in each reactor, control the heat balance and the temperature
levels in each reactor. The effect of having combustion in two
reactors compared to conventional combustion in a single stage
is that the CO, is not diluted with nitrogen gas, but is almost pure
after separation from water, without requiring any extra energy
demand and costly external equipment for CO, separation.

The chemical looping principle may be applied either in
a gas turbine cycle with pressurized oxidation and reduction
reactors, or in a steam turbine cycle with atmospheric pressure
in the reactors. In the case of a gas turbine cycle, the oxidation
reactor replaces the combustion chamber of a conventional
gas turbine. The exothermic oxidation reaction provides heat
for increasing the air temperature entering the downstream
expansion turbine. In addition, the reduction reactor exit
stream may also be expanded in a turbine together with steam
production for power generation. The cooled low pressure CO,
stream will then be compressed to pipeline pressure. Another
option is to generate steam using heat transfer surfaces in the
oxidation reactor. Current circulating fluidized bed combustion
technology operating at atmospheric pressure in both the
oxidation and reduction stages necessitates the use of a steam
turbine cycle for power generation. Using natural gas as fuel
in a chemical looping combustion cycle which supplies a
gas turbine combined cycle power plant and delivering CO,
at atmospheric pressure, the potential for natural gas fuel-to-
electricity conversion efficiency is estimated to be in the range
45-50% (Brandvoll and Bolland, 2004). Work on chemical
looping combustion is currently in the pilot plant and materials
research stage.

Then the process is referred to as steam methane reforming
(SMR), but can also be other light hydrocarbons, such as
naphtha. The process begins with the removal of sulphur
compounds from the feed, since these are poisons to the current
nickel-based catalyst and then steam is added. The reforming
reaction (1), which is endothermic, takes place over a catalyst at
high temperature (800°C-900°C). Heat is supplied to the reactor
tubes by burning part of the fuel (secondary fuel). The reformed
gas is cooled in a waste heat boiler which generates the steam

Shift reactors in one or two stages are used to convert most of

Future oxy-fuel demonstration plants could be based on
retrofits to existing equipment such as process heaters and
boilers, in order to minimize development costs and achieve
early market entry. In this respect, power systems of reference
for oxy-fuel combustion capture are mainly the steam-based
pulverized coal and natural gas fired plants that currently
represent up to 1468 GW., or 40% (IEA WEO, 2004) of the
existing global infrastructure (see also Section 3.1.2.3). Several
demonstration units may be expected within the next few years
particularly in Europe, USA, Canada and Australia where
active research initiatives are currently underway. As these
developments proceed and the technologies achieve market
penetration they may become competitive relative to alternate
options based on pre- and post-combustion CO, capture. A
significant incentive to the development of oxy-fuel combustion
technology, as well as for pre- and post-combustion capture
technologies, is the introduction of environmental requirements
and/or fiscal incentives to promote CO, capture and storage.

For large-scale hydrogen production, the oxygen is supplied
from a cryogenic air separation unit (ASU). The high investment
and energy consumption of the ASU is compensated by the
higher efficiency and lower cost of the gasification process and
the absence of N, (from the air) in the syngas, which reduces
the separation costs considerably. However for pre-combustion
de-carbonization applications, in which the hydrogen would be
used as fuel in a gas turbine, it will be necessary to dilute the H,
with either N, or steam to reduce flame temperature in the gas
turbine combustor and to limit NO, emission levels. In this case
the most efficient system will use air as the oxidant and produce

"The conventional two-stage CO conversion reduces the CO
concentration in syngas (or in hydrogen) down to 0.2-0.3%.
High temperature shift reactors operating between 400°C and

can be used at temperatures from 180°C-350°C and leave from
0.2-1% CO in the exhaust. Lower CO content favours higher
CO, recovery. The gas is then cooled and hydrogen is produced
by a CO,/H, separation step. Until about 30 years ago, the CO,
was removed using a chemical (solvent) absorption process
such as an amine or hot potassium carbonate and was rejected
to atmosphere as a pure stream from the top of the regenerator.
There are many of these plants still in use and the CO, could be

"Each of the three syngas generation technologies, SMR, ATR
and POX produce high temperature gas which must be cooled,
producing in each case a steam flow in excess of that required
by the reforming and shift reactions. It is possible to reduce
this excess production by, for example, using preheated air and
a pre-reformer in an SMR plant. Another technique is to use
the hot syngas, leaving the primary reactor, as the shell-side
heating fluid in a tubular steam/hydrocarbon reforming reactor
which can operate in series, or in parallel, with the primary
reactor (Abbott et al., 2002). The addition of a secondary gas
heated reformer will increase the hydrogen production by up
to 33% and eliminate the excess steam production. The overall
efficiency is improved and specific capital cost is typically
reduced by 15%. Again, CO, capture is accomplished as
described previously for steam methane reforming.

"Modern plants, however, use a pressure swing adsorber
(PSA), where gases other than H, are adsorbed in a set of
switching beds containing layers of solid adsorbent such as
activated carbon, alumina and zeolites (see the fuller description
of PSA in Section 3.5.2.9). The H, exiting the PSA (typically
about 2.2 MPa) can have a purity of up to 99.999%, depending
on the market need. The CO, is contained in a stream, from the
regeneration cycle, which contains some methane and H,. The
stream is used as fuel in the reformer where it is combusted
in air and the CO, ends up being vented to atmosphere in the
reformer flue gas. Hence, to capture CO, from modern SMR
plants would require one of the post-combustion processes
described above in Section 3.3. Alternatively, the PSA system
could be designed not only for high recovery of pure H, but also
to recover pure CO, and have a fuel gas as the third product

a ‘wet’ CO, removal plant with an appropriate amine solvent. In
this case the CO,-deficient syngas exiting the amine scrubber is
passed to a PSA unit from which relatively pure H, is recovered

natural gas to provide the needed reformer heat. The CO, is
recovered from the amine solvent by heating and pressurized

The autothermal reforming (ATR) process can be considered
as a combination of the two processes described above. The
heat required in the SMR reactor is generated by the partial
oxidation reaction (2) using air or oxygen, but because steam
is supplied to the reactor as well as excess natural gas, the
endothermic reforming reaction (1) occurs in a catalytic section
of the reactor downstream of the POX burner. The addition of
steam enables a high conversion of fuel to hydrogen at a lower
temperature. Operating temperatures of the autothermal process
are typically 950-1050°C, although this depends on the design
of the process. An advantage of the process, compared to SMR,
is the lower investment cost for the reactor and the absence of
any emissions of CO, since all heat release is internal, although
this is largely offset by investment and operating cost for the
oxygen plant. The range of fuels that can be processed is similar
to the SMR process, but the feed gas must be sulphur free.
CO, capture is accomplished as described above for the steam
methane reforming.

coal-based IGCC plants are not less costly than pulverized

would often be desirable to recover H,S and CO, in the same

Synfuel manufacture involves O,-blown gasification to make
syngas, gas cooling, gas clean-up, water gas shift and acid gas
(H,S/CO,) removal. Subsequently cleaned syngas is converted
catalytically to fuel in a synthesis reactor and unconverted
syngas is separated from the liquid fuel product. At this point
either most unconverted gas is recycled to the synthesis
reactor to generate additional liquid fuel and the remaining
unconverted gas is used to make electricity for onsite needs, or
syngas is passed only once through the synthesis reactor, and all
unconverted syngas is used for other purposes, for example, to
make electricity for sale to the electric grid as well as for onsite
use. The latter once through option is often more competitive
as a technology option (Williams, 2000; Gray and Tomlinson,
2001; Larson and Ren, 2003; Celik et al., 2005).

"New slurry-phase synthesis reactors make the once through
configuration especially attractive for CO-rich (e.g., coal-
derived) syngas by making high once through conversion
possible. For once through systems, a water gas shift reactor
is often placed upstream of the synthesis reactor to generate
the H/CO ratio that maximizes synfuel conversion in the
synthesis reactor. It is desirable to remove most CO, from
shifted syngas to maximize synthetic fuel conversion. Also,
because synthesis catalysts are extremely sensitive to H,S and
various trace contaminants, these must be removed to very low
levels ahead of the synthesis reactor. Most trace metals can
be removed at low-cost using an activated carbon filter. CO,
removal from syngas upstream of the synthesis reactor is a low-
cost, partial de-carbonization option, especially when H,S and
CO, are co-captured and co-stored as an acid gas management
strategy (Larson and Ren, 2003). Further de-carbonization can
be realized in once through systems, at higher incremental cost,
by adding additional shift reactors downstream of the synthesis
reactor, recovering the CO,, and using the CO,-depleted, H,-rich
syngas to make electricity or some mix of electricity plus H, in
a ‘polygeneration’ configuration (see Figure 3.16). The relative
amounts of H, and electricity produced would depend mainly
on relative demands, as there do not seem to be thermodynamic
or cost advantages for particular H,/electricity production ratios
(Chiesa et al., 2005; Kreutz et al., 2005). When syngas is de-
carbonized both upstream and downstream of the synthesis
reactor (see Figure 3.16) it is feasible to capture and store as

"J.J.2./ Hydrogen from coal with CO, capture

Relative to intensively studied coal IGCC technology with CO,
capture, there are few studies in the public domain on making H,
from coal via gasification with CO, capture (NRC, 2004; Parsons
2002a, b; Gray and Tomlinson, 2003; Chiesa et al., 2005; Kreutz
et al., 2005), even though this H, technology is well established
commercially, as noted above. With commercial technology,
H, with CO, capture can be produced via coal gasification in a
system similar to a coal IGCC plant with CO, capture. In line
with the design recommendations for coal IGCC plants described
above (IEA GHG, 2003), what follows is the description from
a design study of a coal H, system that produces, using best
available technology, 1070 MW, of H, from high-sulphur (3.4%)
bituminous coal (Chiesa et al., 2005; Kreutz et al., 2005). In the
base case design, syngas is produced in an entrained flow quench
gasifier operated at 7 MPa. The syngas is cooled, cleaned of
particulate matter, and shifted (to primarily H, and CO,) in sour
water gas shift reactors. After further cooling, H,S is removed
from the syngas using a physical solvent (Selexol). CO, is then
removed from the syngas, again using Selexol. After being
stripped from the solvents, the H,S is converted to elemental S
in a Claus unit and a plant provides tail gas clean-up to remove
residual sulphur emissions; and the CO, is either vented or
dried and compressed to 150 atm for pipeline transport and
underground storage. High purity H, is extracted at 6 MPa from
the H,-rich syngas via a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit.
The PSA purge gas is compressed and burned in a conventional
gas turbine combined cycle, generating 78 MW, and 39 MW, of
electricity in excess of onsite electricity needs in the without and
with CO, capture cases, respectively. For this base case analysis,
the effective efficiency of H, manufacture was estimated to be
64% with CO, vented and 61% with CO, captured, while the
corresponding emission rates are 16.9 kgCO, and 1.4 kgCO,/
kgH,, respectively. For the capture case, the CO, removal rate
was 14.8 kgCO,/kgH.,. Various alternative system configurations
were explored. It was found that there are no thermodynamic or
cost advantages from increasing the electricity/H, output ratio,
so this ratio would tend to be determined by relative market
demands for electricity and H,. One potentially significant
option for reducing the cost of H, with CO, capture to about the
same level as with CO, vented involves H,S/CO, co-capture in a
single Selexol unit, as discussed above.

The use of high sulphur fossil fuels in a pre-combustion
capture process results in syngas with H,S. Acid gas components
must be removed. If transport and storage of mixed CO, and
H,S is possible then both components can be removed together.
Sulphinol was developed to achieve significantly higher
solubilities of acidic components compared to amine solvents,
without added problems of excessive corrosion, foaming, or
solution degradation. It consists of a mixture of sulpholane
(tetrahydrothiophene 1,1-dioxide), an alkanolamine and water

The PSA process is built around adsorptive separations of
cyclic character. The cycles consist of two basic steps: adsorption,
in which the more adsorbable species are selectively removed
from the feed gas and regeneration (desorption), when these
species are removed from the adsorbent so that it can be ready
for the next cycle. It is possible to obtain useful products during
both adsorption and regeneration. The principal characteristic
of PSA processes is the use of a decrease in pressure and/or the
purge by a less adsorbable gas to clean the adsorbent bed. Apart
from adsorption and regeneration, a single commercial PSA
cycle consists of a number of additional steps, including co-
and counter-current pressurization, pressure equalization and
co- and counter-current depressurization. A detailed description
of the PSA technique, along with its practical applications can
be found elsewhere (Ruthven et al., 1994).

Inorganic membranes with operating temperatures up to 1000°C

offer the possibility of combining reaction and separation
of the hydrogen in a single stage at high temperature and
pressure to overcome the equilibrium limitations experienced
in conventional reactor configurations for the production of
hydrogen. The combination of separation and reaction in
membrane steam reforming and/or membrane water gas shift
offers higher conversion of the reforming and/or shift reactions
due to the removal of hydrogen from these equilibrium reactions
as shown in Reactions (1) and (3) respectively. The reforming
reaction is endothermic and can, with this technique, be forced
to completion at lower temperature than normal (typically 500-
600°C). The shift reaction being exothermic can be forced to
completion at higher temperature (500-600°C).

Another reason to incorporate H, separation membranes in
the hydrogen production system is that CO, is also produced
without the need for additional separation equipment. Membrane
reactors allow one-step reforming, or a single intermediate water
gas shift reaction, with hydrogen separation (the permeate)
leaving behind a retentate gas which is predominantly CO, and
asmall amount of non-recovered hydrogen and steam. This CO,
remains at the relatively high pressure of the reacting system (see
Figure 3.17). Condensation of the steam leaves a concentrated
CO, stream at high pressure, reducing the compression energy
for transport and storage. Membrane reforming will benefit from
high-pressure operation due to the increased H, partial pressure
differential across the membrane which is the driving force for
hydrogen permeation. Therefore membrane reactors are also
seen as a good option for pre-combustion de-carbonization
where a low-pressure hydrogen stream for fuel gas and a high-
pressure CO,-rich stream for transport and storage are required.
The use of the membrane reformer reactor in a gas turbine
combined cycle means that the hydrogen needs to be produced
at such pressure that the significant power consumption for
the hydrogen compression is avoided. This could be done by
increasing the operating pressure of the membrane reactor or
by using a sweep gas, for instance steam, at the permeate side
of the membrane (Jordal er al., 2003).

In the plasma cracking process natural gas or other
hydrocarbons are supplied to a plasma reactor where the
hydrocarbons are cracked under pyrolysis conditions (i.e., in
absence of oxides, e.g., steam, which can supply oxygen to
form CO or CO,). The plasma arc, for which electricity is used,
supplies the heat for the cracking reaction. Advantages of the
process are its flexibility with respect to the fuel and the high
quality carbon black which can be produced. Two small-scale
plasma cracking processes for hydrogen/syngas production have
been in development. The Glid Arc process has been developed

second process is the Kvaerner CB&H process. Kvaerner has

"The main advantage of the process is that it can potentially yield
a clean gas (free of carbon oxides) that could be used directly
for power production, but a disadvantage is that the chemical
energy from the oxidation of carbon to CO, is not released. The
cracking reaction is endothermic and so heat has to be supplied to
the reaction. If the natural gas is converted fully, the theoretical
yield of hydrogen corresponds to 60% of the heating value of
the natural gas. The amount of carbon, which can be obtained,
corresponds to 49% of the heating value, with the extra 9% of
the energy in this calculation being provided as endothermic
heat shown by reaction (4) above. Therefore full conversion can
be achieved only if heat is supplied from an external source.
If full conversion of methane is not achieved, the remaining
methane will be combusted to produce heat. There are many
different methods under development for reactors based on this
principle, including thermal catalytic, thermal non-catalytic and
plasma cracking.

"3.5.4.2 Use of de-carbonized fuel in gas turbine systems

There is extensive commercial experience with hydrogen-rich
fuel gas firing in gas turbines. For example, General Electric
reports over 450,000 hours of operating experience with
high hydrogen (52-95% by volume) content fuel gas in gas
turbines (Shilling and Jones, 2003). Unfortunately, most of that
experience is for ‘refinery gas’ where methane is the other main
component of the fuel gas and is utilized in older lower firing
temperature gas turbines, not the state-of-the-art over 1300°C
gas turbines normally considered for large de-carbonization

power plants.

For pre-combustion capture of CO, from coal, oxygen-
blown gasification is usually preferred (IEA GHG, 2003).
Nitrogen dilution of the hydrogen required for firing in modern
gas turbines comes from the cryogenic air separation unit (used
to make the oxygen; see Section 3.4.5.1). The nitrogen is added
to the hydrogen after the gasification, CO shifting and CO,
capture to reduce the equipment sizes and cost. High-pressure
air is usually extracted from the gas turbine to supply a higher
than normal pressure cryogenic air separation unit to reduce
costs plus air, oxygen and nitrogen compression power. An
alternative IGCC scheme that incorporates newly emerging ion
transport membranes for oxygen production is also described
below in Section 3.5.4.3.

For autothermal reforming or the partial oxidation of natural
gas, if the permeate side of the oxygen transport membrane is
exposed to a natural gas plus water vapour stream in the presence
of a reforming catalyst, the oxygen will react as it leaves the
membrane in an exothermic reaction (Dyer et al., 2001; Carolan
et al., 2001), which will provide heat for the endothermic steam/
natural gas reforming reaction. The oxygen partial pressure at
these highly-reducing, high temperature conditions is extremely
low, allowing heated air at close to atmospheric pressure to be
used on the feed side of the membrane while producing a H,
+ CO mixture at high pressure from the permeate side. This
system can be used to produce H, following CO shift reaction
and CO, removal.

For pre-combustion capture of CO, from natural gas,
air-blown gasification or autothermal reforming is usually
preferred (IEA GHG, 2000b; Wilkinson and Clarke, 2002).
Nitrogen dilution of the hydrogen required for firing in modern
gas turbines comes from the gasification air. High-pressure air
is usually extracted from the gas turbine to feed the air-blown
gasifier, or autothermal reformer to reduce costs and avoid a
separate air compressor. The balance between the amount of
air withdrawn from the gas turbine and the amount provided
from a separate air compressor is determined by the particular
characteristics of the gas turbine used. Some gas turbines can
accept a higher ratio of expander to compressor flow, allowing
greater volumes of dilution gas or smaller air-side draw flow
and giving higher power output.

Oxygen required for a coal-fired IGCC process (Section
3.5.2.6) can be generated in an oxygen transport membrane
system by using a heated, high-pressure air stream produced by
heating the discharge air from the compressor section of a gas
turbine (Allam et al., 2002), typically at 1.6 MPa or 420°C, to
the precise inlet temperature of the oxygen transport membrane
module which is above 700°C. The oxygen, which permeates
to the low-pressure side passes through a heat recovery section
and is compressed to the final pressure of use. The O, depleted
air leaving the oxygen transport membrane module then enters
the gas turbine combustor where it is used to burn fuel before
entering the gas turbine expander at the required temperature.
Note that due to the necessity to have excess air in a gas turbine
to limit turbine inlet temperature, removing one mole of oxygen
can be compensated by injection of the equivalent thermal
capacity of steam to maintain gas turbine power output. Studies
have been carried out (Armstrong ef al., 2002) to compare
oxygen transport membrane and cryogenic oxygen production
in an IGCC power plant using coal as fuel. The oxygen plant
projected cost was reduced by 35% and the power consumption
by 37%. An LHV efficiency of 41.8% without CO, capture and
compression is reported for this cycle compared to 40.9% when
a conventional cryogenic oxygen plant is used.

capabilities of the high temperature fuel cells resulting in an
anode off-gas that has a high CO,-content, but also contains

In power systems, pre-combustion CO, capture in natural
gas combined cycles has not been demonstrated. However,
studies show that based on current state of the art gas turbine
combined cycles, pre-combustion CO, capture will reduce the
efficiency from 56% LHV to 48% LHV (IEA, 2000b). In natural
gas combined cycles, the most significant area for efficiency
improvement is the gas turbine and it is expected that by 2020,
the efficiency of a natural gas combined cycle could be as
high as 65% LHV (IEA GHG, 2000d). For such systems the
efficiency with CO, capture would equal the current state-of-

separation of CO, at some point in the conversion process.
The resulting H,-rich fuel can be fed to a hydrogen consuming

The captured CO, stream may contain impurities which
would have practical impacts on CO, transport and storage
systems and also potential health, safety and environmental
impacts. The types and concentrations of impurities depend on
the type of capture process, as shown in Table 3.4, and detailed
plant design. The major impurities in CO, are well known but
there is little published information on the fate of any trace
impurities in the feed gas such as heavy metals. If substances
are captured along with the CO, then their net emissions to the

CO, capture systems require an increase in energy use for their
operation. As defined in this report (see Section 1.5 and Figure

expressed as the additional energy required to produce a unit
of useful product, such as a kilowatt-hour of electricity (for the
case of a power plant). As the energy and resource requirement
for CO, capture (which includes the energy needed to compress

Power plants with co, capture would emit a CO,-depleted
flue gas to the atmosphere. The concentrations of most harmful
substances in the flue gas would be similar to or lower than
in the flue gas from plants without CO, capture, because CO,
capture processes inherently remove some impurities and
some other impurities have to be removed upstream to enable
the CO, capture process to operate effectively. For example,
post-combustion solvent absorption processes require low
concentrations of sulphur compounds in the feed gas to avoid
excessive solvent loss, but the reduction in the concentration
of an impurity may still result in a higher rate of emissions per
kWh of product, depending upon the actual amount removed
upstream and the capture system energy requirements. As
discussed below (Section 3.6.1.2), the latter measure is more
relevant for environmental assessments. In the case of post-
combustion solvent capture, the flue gas may also contain
traces of solvent and ammonia produced by decomposition of
solvent.

"3.6.1.3 Resource and emission impacts for current systems

Only recently have the environmental and resource implications
of CCS energy requirements been discussed and quantified
for a variety of current CCS systems. Table 3.5 displays the
assumptions and results from a recent comparison of three
common fossil fuel power plants employing current technology
to capture 90% of the CO, produced (Rubin er al., 2005).
Increases in specific fuel consumption relative to the reference
plant without CO, capture correspond directly to the AE
values defined above. For these three cases, the plant energy
requirement per kWh increases by 31% for the PC plant, 16%
for the coal-based IGCC plant and 17% for the NGCC plant. For
the specific examples used in Table 3.5, the increase in energy
consumption for the PC and NGCC plants are in the mid-range
of the values for these systems reported later in Tables 3.7 to
3.15 (see also Section 3.6.1.2), whereas the IGCC case is nearer
the low end of the reported range for such systems. As a result
of the increased energy input per kWh of output, additional
resource requirements for the PC plant include proportionally
greater amounts of coal, as well as limestone (consumed by
the FGD system for SO, control) and ammonia (consumed by
the SCR system for NO, control). All three plants additionally
require more sorbent make-up for the CO, capture units. Table
3.5 also shows the resulting increases in solid residues for
these three cases. In contrast, atmospheric emissions of CO,
decrease sharply as a result of the CCS systems, which also
remove residual amounts of other acid gases, especially SO,
in flue gas streams. Thus, the coal combustion system shows a
net reduction in SO, emission rate as a result of CO, capture.
However, because of the reduction in plant efficiency, other air
emission rates per kWh increase relative to the reference plants
without capture. For the PC and NGCC systems, the increased
emissions of ammonia are a result of chemical reactions in
the amine-based capture process. Not included in this analysis
are the incremental impacts of upstream operations such as
mining, processing and transport of fuels and other resources.

other plant emissions, in support of clean air goals. If, however,
the deployment of new CCS plants is delayed significantly,
older existing plants could well be replaced by modern high-

be built to provide additional capacity in regions with high

both exposure and effects is required to characterize the risk for
various situations associated with carbon dioxide processing

sections for established risk management practices. The most
probable routes of human exposure to carbon dioxide are
inhalation or skin contact. The need for a risk-based approach
is clear from the following two descriptions. Carbon dioxide
and its products of degradation are not legally classified as a
toxic substance; is non-hazardous on inhalation, is a non-irritant
and does not sensitize or permeate the skin. However, chronic
effects on humans follow from long-term exposure to airborne
carbon dioxide concentrations of between 0.5 and 1% resulting
in metabolic acidosis and increased calcium deposits in soft
tissues. The substance is toxic to the cardiovascular system and
upper respiratory tract at concentrations above 3%. Sensitive
populations to elevated carbon dioxide levels are described
in Annex I. The product risk assessment process is therefore
necessary as with any other chemical use to determine the risk
and establish the necessary risk management processes.

Because some of these measures are reported in the same units
(e.g., US dollars per tonne of CO,) there is great potential for
misunderstanding. Furthermore, for any given cost measure,
different assumptions about the technical, economic and

rise to large differences in reported capture costs. Section 3.7.2

"Capital cost (also known as investment cost or first cost)
is a widely used, albeit incomplete, metric of the cost of a
technology. It is often reported on a normalized basis (e.g., cost
per kW). For CO, capture systems, the capital cost is generally
assumed to represent the total expenditure required to design,
purchase and install the system of interest. It may also include
the additional costs of other plant components not needed in
the absence of a CO, capture device, such as the costs of an
upstream gas purification system to protect the capture device.
Such costs often arise in complex facilities like a power plant.
Thus, the total incremental cost of CO, capture for a given

between plants with and without CO, capture, producing the

is especially problematic in studies of ‘advanced’ technologies
that are still under development and not currently commercial.
In most cases, studies of advanced technologies assume that
costs apply to an ‘n"" plant’ to be built sometime in the future

expected benefits of technological learning, but may or may
not adequately account for the increased costs that typically

Different organizations employ different systems of accounts
to specify the elements of a capital cost estimate. For electric
power plants, one widely used procedure is that defined by
the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI, 1993). However,
because there is no universally employed nomenclature
or system of accounts, capital costs reported by different
organizations or authors may not always include the same items.
The terms used to report capital costs may further disguise such
differences and lead to misunderstandings about what is and is
not included. For example, power plant cost studies often report
a value of capital cost that does not include the cost of interest
during construction or other so-called ‘owners costs’ that
typically add at least 10-20% (sometimes substantially more)
to the ‘total capital requirement’ of a system. Only if a capital
cost breakdown is reported can such omissions be discovered.
Studies that fail to report the year of a cost estimate introduce
further uncertainty that may affect cost comparisons.

One of the most widely used measures for the cost of CO, capture
and storage is the ‘cost of CO, avoided.’ This value reflects the
average cost of reducing atmospheric CO, mass emissions by
one unit while providing the same amount of useful product as
a ‘reference plant’ without CCS. For an electric power plant the
avoidance cost can be defined as:

"SII NI I OE IID LN I

The choice of the reference plant without CO, capture plays
a key role in determining the CO, avoidance cost. Here the
reference plant is assumed to be a plant of the same type and
design as the plant with CO, capture. This provides a consistent
basis for reporting the incremental cost of CO, capture for a
particular type of facility.

"5 For CO, capture systems with large auxiliary energy requirements, the
magnitude of incremental cost also depends on whether the plant with capture
is assumed to be a larger facility producing the same net output as the reference
plant without capture, or whether the reference plant is simply derated to supply
the auxiliary energy. While the latter assumption is most common, the former
yields a smaller incremental cost due to economy-of-scale effects.

Equation (7) shows that many factors affect this incremental
cost. For example, just as the total capital cost includes many
different items, so too do the fixed and variable costs associated
with plant operation and maintenance (O&M). Similarly, the
fixed charge factor (FCF, also known as the capital recovery
factor) reflects assumptions about the plant lifetime and the
effective interest rate (or discount rate) used to amortize capital
costs.° Assumptions about any of the factors in Equation (7)
can have a pronounced effect on overall cost results. Nor are
these factors all independent of one another. For example, the
design heat rate of a new power plant may affect the total capital
requirement since high-efficiency plants usually are more costly
than lower- “efficiency designs.

Finally, because several of the parameter values in Equation
(7) may change over the operating life of a facility (such as
the capacity factor, unit fuel cost, or variable operating costs),
the value of COE also may vary from year to year. To include
such effects, an economic evaluation would calculate the net
present value (NPV) of discounted costs based on a schedule of
year-to-year cost variations, in lieu of the simpler formulation
of Equation (7). However, most engineering-economic studies
use Equation (7) to calculate a single value of ‘levelized’ COE
over the assumed life of the plant. The levelized COE is the
cost of electricity, which, if sustained over the operating life of
the plant, would produce the same NPV as an assumed stream
of variable year-to-year costs. In most economic studies of CO,
capture, however, all parameter values in Equation (7) are held
constant, reflecting (either implicitly or explicitly) a levelized
COE over the life of the plant.’

Using Equation (8), a cost of CO, avoided can be calculated
for any two plant types, or any two aggregates of plants.
Thus, special care should be taken to ensure that the basis
for a reported cost of CO, avoided is clearly understood or
conveyed. For example, the avoidance cost is sometimes
taken as a measure of the cost to society of reducing GHG
emissions.* In that case, the cost per tonne of CO, avoided
reflects the average cost of moving from one situation (e.g., the
current mix of power generation fuels and technologies) to a
different mix of technologies having lower overall emissions.
Alternatively, some studies compare individual plants with and
without capture (as we do), but assume different types of plants
for the two cases. Such studies, for example, might compare
a coal-fired plant with capture to an NGCC reference plant
without capture. Such cases reflect a different choice of system
boundaries and address very different questions, than those
addressed here. However, the data presented in this section
(comparing the same type of plant with and without capture)
can be used to estimate a cost of CO, avoided for any two of the
systems of interest in a particular situation (see Chapter 8).

As the energy requirement for CCS is substantially larger
than for other emission control systems, it has important
implications for plant economics as well as for resource
requirements and environmental impacts. The energy ‘penalty’
(as it is often called) enters cost calculations in one of two ways.
Most commonly, all energy needed to operate CCS absorbers,
compressors, pumps and other equipment is assumed to be
provided within the plant boundary, thus lowering the net plant
capacity (kW) and output (kWh, in the case of a power plant).
The result, as shown by Equation (7), is a higher unit capital
cost (US$ kW"") and a higher cost of electricity production (US$
kWh’). Effectively, these higher unit costs reflect the expense
of building and operating the incremental capacity needed to
operate the CCS system.

Alternatively, some studies - particularly for industrial
processes such as hydrogen production - assume that some or
all of the energy needed to operate the CCS system is purchased
from outside the plant boundary at some assumed price. Still
other studies assume that new equipment is installed to generate
auxiliary energy on-site. In these cases, the net plant capacity and
output may or may not change and may even increase. However,
the COE in Equation (7) again will rise due to the increases in
VOM costs (for purchased energy) and (if applicable) capital
costs for additional equipment. The assumption of purchased
power, however, does not guarantee a full accounting of the
replacement costs or CO, emissions associated with CCS. In
all cases, however, the larger the CCS energy requirement, the
greater the difference between the costs of CO, captured and
avoided.
"	Text
"Recall that CO, capture, while practiced today in some industrial
applications, is not currently a commercial technology used at
large electric power plants, which are the focus of most CCS
studies. Thus, cost estimates for CO, capture systems rely
mainly on studies of hypothetical plants. Published studies also
differ significantly in the assumptions used for cost estimation.
Equation (7), for example, shows that the plant capacity factor
has a major impact on the cost of electric power generation,
as do the plant lifetime and discount rate used to compute the
fixed charge factor. The COE, in turn, is a key element of CO,
avoidance cost, Equation (8). Thus, a high plant capacity factor
or a low fixed charge rate will lower the cost of CO, capture
per kWh. The choice of other important parameters, such as
the plant size, efficiency, fuel type and CO, removal rate will
similarly affect the CO, capture cost. Less apparent, but often
equally important, are assumptions about parameters such as the
‘contingency cost factors’ embedded in capital cost estimates
to account for unspecified costs anticipated for technologies at
an early stage of development, or for commercial systems that
have not yet been demonstrated for the application, location, or
plant scale under study.

"Because of the variability of assumptions employed in
different studies of CO, capture, a systematic comparison of cost
results is not straightforward (or even possible in most cases).
Moreover, there is no universally ‘correct’ set of assumptions
that apply to all the parameters affecting CO, capture cost. For
example, the quality and cost of natural gas or coal delivered
to power plants in Europe and the United States may differ
markedly. Similarly, the cost of capital for a municipal or
government-owned utility may be significantly lower than for a
privately-owned utility operating in a competitive market. These
and other factors lead to real differences in CO, capture costs
for a given technology or power generation system. Thus, we
seek in this report to elucidate the key assumptions employed
in different studies of similar systems and technologies and
their resulting impact on the cost of CO, capture. Analyses
comparing the costs of alternative systems on an internally
consistent basis (within a particular study) also are highlighted.
Nor are all studies equally credible, considering their vintage,
data sources, level of detail and extent of peer review. Thus,
the approach adopted here is to rely as much as possible on
recent peer-reviewed literature, together with other publicly-
available studies by governmental and private organizations
heavily involved in the field of CO, capture. Later, in Chapter 8,
the range of capture costs reported here are combined with cost
estimates for CO, transport and storage to arrive at estimates

"Most of the world’s electricity is currently generated from
the combustion of fossil fuels, especially coal and (to an
increasing extent) natural gas. Hence, the ability to capture and
store the CO, emitted by such plants has been a major focus
of investigation. This section of the report focuses on the cost
of currently available technology for CO, capture. Because
of the relatively low CO, concentration in power plant flue
gases, chemical absorption systems have been the dominant

Table 3.7 summarizes the key assumptions and results of recent
studies of post-combustion CO, capture at new coal-fired
power plants. Assumed plant sizes with CO, capture range from
approximately 300-700 MW net power output. In all cases,
CO, capture is accomplished using an amine-based absorption
system, typically MEA. Capture efficiencies range from 85-95%
with the most common value being 90%. The studies employ
different assumptions about other key parameters such as the
base power plant efficiency, coal properties, coal cost, plant
capacity factor, CO, product pressure and financial parameters
such as the fixed charge factor. All of these factors have a direct
influence on total plant e¢ cost and the cost of CO, capture.

The sections below review and summarize recent estimates
of CO, capture costs for major systems of interest. Sections
3.7.5 to 3.7.8 focus first on the cost of current CO, capture
technologies, while Sections 3.7.10 to 3.7.12 go on to discuss
improved or ‘advanced’ technologies promising lower costs in
the future. In all cases the system boundary is defined as a single
facility at which CO, is captured and compressed for delivery
to a transport and storage system. To reflect different levels of
confidence (or uncertainty) in cost estimates for technologies
at different stages of development, the qualitative descriptors
shown in Table 3.6 are applied in summarizing published cost
estimates.? The studies reviewed typically report costs in US
dollars for reference years ranging from 2000 to early 2004.
Because inflation effects generally have been small during this
period no adjustments have been made in summarizing ranges
of reported costs.

Table 3.7 summarizes several measures of CO, capture cost,
both in absolute and relative terms. Across the full set of studies,
CO, capture adds 44-87% to the capital cost of the reference
plant (US$ kW'') and 42-81% to the cost of electricity (US$
MWh""), while achieving CO, reductions of approximately
80-90% per net kWh produced. The cost of CO, avoided for
these cases varies from 29-51 US$/tCO,. The absolute values
of capital cost, COE and incremental cost of electricity in
Table 3.7 reflect the different assumptions employed in each
study. The result is an incremental COE of 18-38 US$ MWh""
(or US$ 0.018-0.038 kWh!) for CO, capture. The total COE
for plants with capture ranges from 62-87 US$ MWh’. In all
cases, a significant portion of the total CO, capture cost is due
to the energy requirement for CO, capture and compression. For
the studies in Table 3.7, the plants with CO, capture require
24-42% more fuel input per MWh of plant output relative to
a similar reference plant without capture. Roughly half the
energy is required for solvent regeneration and a third for CO,
compression.

Recent increases in world coal prices, if sustained, also
would affect the levelized COE values reported here. Based on
one recent study (IEA GHG, 2004), each 1.00 US$ GJ"" increase
in coal price would increase the COE by 8.2 US$ MWh"" for a
new PC plant without capture and by 10.1 US$ MWh’ for a

Power plants fuelled by natural gas may include gas-fired
boilers, simple-cycle gas turbines, or natural gas combined cycle
(NGCC) units. The current operating capacity in use globally
is 333 GW, for gas-fired boilers, 214 GW, for simple cycle
gas turbines and 339 GW, for NGCC (IEA WEO, 2004). The
absence of sulphur and other impurities in natural gas reduces
the capital costs associated with auxiliary flue gas clean-up
systems required for amine-based CO, capture technology. On
the other hand, the lower concentration of CO, in gas-fired units
tends to increase the cost per tonne of CO, captured or avoided
relative to coal-fired units.

"CO, capture system energy requirement, power plant efficiency,
fuel type, plant capacity factor and fixed charge rate (Rao and
Rubin, 2002). In this regard, it is useful to note that the lowest-
cost capture systems in Table 3.7 (in terms of COE and cost of
CO, avoided) come from a recent study (IEA GHG, 2004) that
combines an efficient supercritical power plant design using
bituminous coal, with high plant utilization, lowest fixed charge
rate and more energy-efficient amine system designs, as recently
announced by two major vendors (but not yet demonstrated on
coal-fired power plants). In contrast, the highest reported COE
values are for less efficient subcritical plant designs using low
rank coal, combined with lower capacity factors, higher fixed
charge rates and employing amine system designs typical of
units currently in Operation at small power plants.

Also reflected in Table 3.8 is the option of rebuilding
an existing boiler and steam turbine as a supercritical unit
to gain efficiency improvements in conjunction with CO,
capture. One recent study (Gibbins et al., 2005) suggests this
option could be economically attractive in conjunction with
CO, capture since the more efficient unit minimizes the cost
of capture and yields a greater net power output and a lower
COE compared to a simple retrofit. The use of a new and less
energy-intensive capture unit yields further cost reductions
in this study. Another recent study similarly concluded that
the most economical approach to CO, capture for an existing
coal-fired plant was to combine CO, capture with repowering
the unit with an ultra-supercritical steam system (Simbeck,
2004). One additional option, repowering an existing unit
with a coal gasifier, is discussed later in Section 3.7.6.2.

These results indicate that new power plants equipped
with CO, capture are likely to be high-efficiency supercritical
units, which yield lowest overall costs. The worldwide use of
supercritical units (without capture) with current usage at 155
GW, (Section 3.1.2.2), is rapidly increasing in several regions of
the world and, as seen in Table 3.7, the preponderance of recent
studies of CO, capture are based on supercritical units using
bituminous coals. For these plants, Table 3.7 shows that capture
systems increase the capital cost by 44-74% and the COE by
42-66% (18-34 US$ MWh’). The major factors contributing
to these ranges were differences in plant size, capacity factor
and fixed charge factor. New or improved capture systems and
power plant designs that promise to further reduce the costs of
CO, capture are discussed later in Section 3.7.7. First, however,
we examine CO, capture costs at existing plants.
"	Text
"“Table 3.8 further shows that for comparable levels of
about 85% CO, reduction per kWh, the average cost of CO,
avoided for retrofits is about 35% higher than for the new plants
analyzed in Table 3.7. The incremental capital cost and COE
depend strongly on site-specific assumptions, including the
degree of amortization and options for providing process energy
needs. As with new plants, heat and power for CO, capture are
usually assumed to be provided by the base (reference) plant,
resulting in a sizeable (30 to 40%) plant output reduction. Other
studies assume that an auxiliary gas-fired boiler is constructed
to provide the CO, capture steam requirements and (in some
cases) additional power. Low natural gas prices can make this
option more attractive than plant output reduction (based on
COE), but such systems yield lower CO, reductions (around
60%) since the emissions from natural gas combustion are
typically not captured. For this reason, the avoided cost values
for this option are not directly comparable to those with higher

CO, reductions.

"Compared to the study of new plants, CO, capture options for
existing power plants have received relatively little study to date.
Table 3.8 summarizes the assumptions and results of several
studies estimating the cost of retrofitting an amine-based CO,
capture system to an existing coal-fired power plant. Several
factors significantly affect the economics of retrofits, especially
the age, smaller sizes and lower efficiencies typical of existing
plants relative to new builds. The energy requirement for CO,
capture also is usually higher because of less efficient heat
integration for sorbent regeneration. All of these factors lead to
higher overall costs. Existing plants not yet equipped with a flue
gas desulphurization (FGD) system for SO, control also must
be retrofitted or upgraded for high-efficiency sulphur capture in
addition to the CO, capture device. For plants with high NO,
levels, a NO, removal system also may be required to minimize
solvent loss from reactions with acid gases. Finally, site-specific
difficulties, such as land availability, access to plant areas and
the need for special ductwork, tend to further increase the
capital cost of any retrofit project relative to an equivalent new

Studies of commercial post-combustion CO, capture

applied to simple-cycle gas turbines have been conducted for
the special case of retrofitting an auxiliary power generator in
a remote location (CCP, 2005). This study reported a relatively
high cost of 88 US$/tCO, avoided. Studies of post-combustion
capture for gas-fired boilers have been limited to industrial
applications, as discussed later in Section 3.7.8.

"In countries like the US, higher gas prices have also resulted
in lower utilization rates (averaging 30-50%) for plants originally
designed for base-load operation, but where lower-cost coal
plants are available for dispatch. This further raises the average
cost of electricity and CO, capture for those NGCC plants, as
reflected in one case in Table 3.9 with a capacity factor of 50%.
In other parts of the world, however, lower-cost coal plants may
not be available, or gas supply contracts might limit the ability
to curtail gas use. Such situations again illustrate that options
for power generation with or without CO, capture should be

evaluated in the context of a particular situation or scenario.

"Studies of pre-combustion capture for electric power plants
have focused mainly on IGCC systems using coal or other
solid fuels such as petroleum coke. This section of the report
focuses on currently available technology for CO, capture at
such plants. As before, the cost of CO, capture depends not
only on the choice of capture technology, but more importantly
on the characteristics and design of the overall power plant,
including the fuel type and choice of gasifier. Because IGCC
is not widely used for electric power generation at the present
time, economic studies of IGCC power plants typically employ
design assumptions based on the limited utility experience
with IGCC systems and the more extensive experience with
gasification in industrial sectors such as petroleum refining and
petrochemicals. For oxygen-blown gasifiers, the high operating
pressure and relatively high CO, concentrations achievable in
IGCC systems makes physical solvent absorption systems the
predominant technology of interest for pre-combustion CO,
capture (see Section 3.5.2.11). For purposes of cost reporting,
we again distinguish between new plant designs and the
retrofitting of existing facilities.

"The most important factor affecting the economics of biomass
use is the cost of the biomass. This can range from a negative
value, as in the case of some biomass wastes, to costs substantially
higher than coal, as in the case of some purposely-grown biomass
fuels, or wastes that have to be collected from diffuse sources.
Power plants that use only biomass are typically smaller than
coal-fired plants because local availability of biomass is often
limited and biomass is more bulky and hence more expensive
to transport than coal. The smaller sizes of biomass-fired plants
would normally result in lower energy efficiencies and higher
costs of CO, capture. Biomass can be co-fired with coal in
larger plants (Robinson ef al., 2003). In such circumstances the
incremental costs of capturing biomass-derived CO, should be
similar to costs of capturing coal-derived CO,. Another option is
to convert biomass into pellets or refined liquid fuels to reduce
the cost of transporting it over long distances. However, there are
costs and emissions associated with production of these refined
fuels. Information on costs of CO, capture at biomass-fired
plants is sparse but some information is given in Section 3.7.8.4.
The overall economics of CCS with biomass combustion will
depend very much on local circumstances, especially biomass
availability and cost and (as with fossil fuels) proximity to
potential CO, storage sites.
"	Text
"As seen earlier in Equations (7) to (9), assumptions about
the plant fuel cost have an especially important influence on the
COE for gas-fired plants because the contribution of capital costs
is relatively low compared to coal plants. The studies in Table
3.9 assume stable gas prices of 2.82-4.44 US$ GJ! (LHV basis)
over the life of the plant, together with high capacity factors
(65-95%) representing base load operation. These assumptions
result in relatively low values of COE for both the reference
plant and capture plant. Since about 2002, however, natural gas
prices have increased significantly in many parts of the world,
which has also affected the outlook for future prices. Based
on the assumptions of one recent study (IEA GHG, 2004), the
COE for an NGCC plant without capture would increase by
6.8 US$ MWh' for each 1.00 US$ GJ"" increase in natural gas
price (assuming no change in plant utilization or other factors
of production). An NGCC plant with CCS would see a slightly
higher increase of 7.3 US$ MWh"". The price of natural gas,
and its relation to the price of competing fuels like coal, is
an important determinant of which type of power plant will
provide the lowest cost electricity in the context of a particular
situation. However, across a twofold increase in gas price (from
3-6 US$ GJ""), the incremental cost of CO, capture changed by
only 2 US$ MWh""! (US$ 0.002 kWh"") with all other factors
held constant.

smaller gas volume treated in oxygen-blown gasifier systems,

"3.7.6.2 Repowering of existing coal-fired plants with IGCC
For some existing coal-fired power plants, an alternative to the
post-combustion capture systems discussed earlier is repowering
with an IGCC system. In this case - depending on site-specific
circumstances - some existing plant components, such as the
steam turbine, might be refurbished and utilized as part of an
IGCC plant. Alternatively, the entire combustion plant might be
replaced with a new IGCC system while preserving other site
facilities and infrastructure.

The costs in Table 3.10 also reflect efforts in some studies
to identify least-cost CO, capture options. For example, one
recent study (IEA GHG, 2003) found that capture and disposal
of hydrogen sulphide (H,S) along with CO, can reduce overall
capture costs by about 20% (although this may increase
transport and storage costs, as discussed in Chapters 4 and

applicable regulatory and permitting requirements. Advanced

"substantially higher COE values result from high financing costs
and lower plant utilization. Similarly, the type and properties
of coal assumed has a major impact on the COE, as seen in
a recent Canadian Clean Power Coalition study, which found
substantially higher costs for low-rank coals using a Texaco-
based IGCC system (Stobbs and Clark, 2005, Table 3.10).
EPRI also reports higher IGCC costs for low-rank coals (Holt
et al., 2003). On the other hand, where plant-level assumptions
and designs are similar across studies, there is relatively little
difference in the estimated costs of CO, capture based on current
commercial technology. Similarly, the several studies in Tables
3.7 and 3.10 that estimate costs for both IGCC and PC plants
on an internally consistent basis, all find that IGCC plants with
capture have a lower COE than PC plants with capture. There
is not yet a high degree of confidence in these cost estimates,
however (see Table 3.6).

Section 3.5 discussed the potential role of hydrogen as an
energy carrier and the technological options for its production.
Here we examine the cost of capturing CO, normally released
during the production of hydrogen from fossil fuels. Table 3.11
shows the key assumptions and cost results of recent studies of
CO, capture costs for plants with hydrogen production rates of
155,000-510,000 Nm* h' (466-1531 MW,), employing either
natural gas or coal as a feedstock. The CO, capture efficiency
for the hydrogen plant ranges from 87-95% using commercially
available chemical and physical absorption systems. The CO,
reduction per unit of product is lower, however, because of the
process energy requirements and because of additional CO,
emitted by an offsite power plant assumed in some of these
studies. As hydrogen production requires the separation of H,
from CO,, the incremental cost of capture is mainly the cost of
CO, compression.

"Although repowering has been widely studied as an option to
improve plant performance and increase plant output, there are
relatively few studies of repowering motivated by CO, capture.
Table 3.8 shows results from one recent study (Chen et al.,
2003) which reports CO, capture costs for IGCC repowering of
a 250 MW coal-fired unit that is assumed to be a fully amortized
(hence, a low COE of 21 US$ MWh’). IGCC repowering
yielded a net plant capacity of 600 MW with CO, capture and
a COE of 62-67 US$ MWh‘! depending on whether or not the
existing steam turbine can be reused. The cost of CO, avoided
was 46-51 US$/tCO,. Compared to the option of retrofitting
the existing PC unit with an amine-based capture system and
retaining the existing boiler (Table 3.8), the COE for IGCC
repowering was estimated to be 10-30% lower. These findings
are in general agreement with earlier studies by Simbeck (1999).
Because the addition of gas turbines roughly triples the gross
plant capacity of a steam-electric plant, candidates for IGCC
repowering are generally limited to smaller existing units (e.g.,
100-300 MW). Taken together with the post-combustion retrofit

Integrated steel mills are some of the world’s largest emitters
of CO,, as described in Chapter 2. About 70% of the carbon
introduced into an integrated steel mill is contained in the blast
furnace gas in the form of CO, and CO, each of which comprise
about 20% by volume of the gas. The cost of capturing CO,
from blast furnace gas was estimated to be 35 US$/tCO, avoided
(Farla et al., 1995) or 18 US$/tCO, captured (Gielen, 2003)

The main large point sources of biomass-derived CO, are
currently wood pulp mills, which emit CO, from black liquor
recovery boilers and bark-fired boilers, and sugar/ethanol mills,
which emit CO, from bagasse-fired boilers. Black liquor is a
byproduct of pulping that contains lignin and chemicals used
in the pulping process. The cost of post-combustion capture
was estimated to be 34 US$/tCO, avoided in a plant that
captures about 1 MtCO, yr! (Millersten et al., 2003). Biomass
gasification is under development as an alternative to boilers.

Iron ore can be reacted with. synthesis gas or : hydrogen
to produce iron by direct reduction (Cheeley, 2000). Direct
reduction processes are already used commercially but further
development work would be needed to reduce their costs so as
to make them more widely competitive with conventional iron
production processes. The cost of capturing CO, from a direct
reduction iron (DRI) production processes was estimated to be
10 US$tCO, (Gielen, 2003). CO, also could be captured from
other gases in iron and steel mills but costs would probably be
higher as they are more dilute or smaller in scale.

"CO, can be captured in other industrial processes using the
techniques described earlier for power generation. While the
costs of capture may vary considerably with the size, type and
location of industrial processes, such costs will be lowest for
processes or plants having: streams with relatively high CO,
concentrations; process plants that normally operate at high load
factors; plants with large CO, emission rates; and, processes
that can utilize waste heat to satisfy the energy requirements
of CO, capture systems. Despite these potential advantages,
little detailed work has been carried out to estimate costs of
CO, capture at industrial plants, with most work focused on
oil refineries and petrochemical plants. A summary of currently
available cost studies appears in Table 3.12.

As noted in Chapter 2, cement plants are the largest industrial
source of CO, apart from power plants. Cement plants normally
burn lower cost high-carbon fuels such as coal, petroleum coke
and various wastes. The flue gas typically has aCO,, concentration
of 14-33% by volume, significantly higher than at power plants,
because CO, is produced in cement kilns by decomposition of
carbonate minerals as well as by fuel combustion. The high CO,
concentration would tend to reduce the specific cost of CO,
capture from flue gas. Pre-combustion capture, if used, would
only capture the fuel-related CO,, so would be only a partial
solution to CO, emissions. Oxy-fuel combustion and capture
using calcium sorbents are other options, which are described
in Sections 3.2.4 and 3.7.11.

Gas-fired process heaters and steam boilers are responsible
for the bulk of the CO, emitted from typical oil refineries and
petrochemical plants. Although refineries and petrochemical
plants emit large quantities of CO,, they include multiple
emission sources often dispersed over a large area. Economies
of scale can be achieved by using centralized CO, absorbers or
amine regenerators but some of the benefits are offset by the cost
of pipes and ducts. Based on Table 3.14, the cost of capturing
and compressing CO, from refinery and petrochemical plant
heaters using current technology is estimated to be 50-60 US$/
tCO, captured. Because of the complexity of these industrial
facilities, along with proprietary concerns, the incremental cost
of plant products is not normally reported.

"producing liquid fuels plus electricity. In these cases the
amounts of electricity produced are sizeable compared to the
liquid products, so the assumed selling price of electricity has
a major influence on the product cost results. So too does the
assumption in two of the cases of co-disposal of H,S with CO,
(as described above). For these reasons, the incremental cost
of CO, capture ranges from a 13% decrease to a 13% increase
in fuel product cost relative to the no-capture case. Note too
that the overall level of CO, reductions per unit of product is
only 27-56%. This is because a significant portion of carbon
in the coal feedstock is exported with the liquid fuel products.
Nonetheless, an important benefit of these fuel-processing
schemes is a reduction (of 30-38%) in the carbon content per
unit of fuel energy relative to the feedstock fuel. To the extent
these liquid fuels displace other fuels with higher carbon per unit
of energy, there is a net benefit in end-use CO, emissions when
the fuels are burned. However, no credit for such reductions is
taken in Table 3.11 because the system boundary considered is
confined to the fuel production plant.

CO, could be captured at steam-generating plants or power
plants that use other biomass byproducts and/or purpose-grown
biomass. At present most biomass plants are relatively small.
The cost of capturing 0.19 MtCO, yr! in a 24 MW biomass-
powered IGCC plant, compared to a biomass IGCC plant
without capture, is estimated to be about 70 US$/tCO, (Audus
and Freund, 2005). Larger plants using purpose-grown biomass
may be built in the future and biomass can be co-fired with
fossil fuels to give economies of scale, as discussed in Chapter
2. Biomass fuels produce similar or slightly greater quantities
of CO, per unit of fuel energy as bituminous coals; thus, the
CO, concentration of flue gases from these fuels will be broadly
similar. This implies that the cost of capturing CO, at large
power plants using biomass may be broadly similar to the cost
of capturing CO, in large fossil fuel power plants in cases where
plant size, efficiency, load factor and other key parameters are
similar. The costs of avoiding CO, emissions in power plants
that use biomass are discussed in more detail in Chapter 8.

"uncertain,"" and that cost estimates for technologies at the early
stages of development are often unreliable and overly optimistic
(Merrow et al., 1981). Qualitative descriptions of cost trends
for advanced technologies and energy systems typically show
costs increasing from the research stage through full-scale
demonstration; only after one or more full-scale commercial
plants are deployed do costs begin to decline for subsequent
units (EPRI, 1993; NRC, 2003). Case studies of the SO, and
NO, capture systems noted above showed similar behaviour,
with large (factor of two or more) increases in the cost of early
full-scale FGD and SCR installations before costs subsequently
declined (Rubin er al., 2004b). Thus, cost estimates for CO,
capture systems should be viewed in the context of their current
stage of development. Here we try to provide a perspective on
potential future costs that combines qualitative judgments with
the quantitative cost estimates offered by technology developers
and analysts. The sections below revisit the areas of power
generation and other industrial processes to highlight some of
the major prospects for CO, capture cost reductions.

It is first important to distinguish between two types of oxy-fuel
systems: an oxy-fuel boiler (either a retrofit or new design) and
oxy-fuel combustion-based gas turbine cycles. The former are
close to demonstration at a commercial scale, while the latter
(such as chemical looping combustion systems and novel power
cycles using CO,/water as working fluid) are still at the design
stage. Table 3.13 summarizes the key assumptions and cost
results of several recent studies of CO, capture costs for oxy-
fuel combustion systems applied to new or existing coal-fired
units. As discussed earlier in Section 3.4, oxygen combustion
produces a flue gas stream consisting primarily of CO, and
water vapour, along with smaller amounts of SO,, nitrogen and
other trace impurities. These designs eliminate the capital and
operating costs of a post-combustion CO, capture system, but
new costs are incurred for the oxygen plant and other system
design modifications. Because oxy-fuel combustion is still under
development and has not yet been utilized or demonstrated for
large-scale power generation, the design basis and cost estimates
for such systems remain highly variable and uncertain. This is
reflected in the wide range of oxy-fuel cost estimates in Table
3.13. Note, however, that cost estimates for advanced design

"The following sections focus on ‘advanced’ technologies that
are not yet commercial available, but which promise to lower
CO, capture costs based on preliminary data and design studies.
Earlier sections of Chapter 3 discussed some of the efforts
underway worldwide to develop lower-cost options for CO,
capture. Some of these developments are based on new process
concepts, while others represent improvements to current
commercial processes. Indeed, the history of technology
innovation indicates that incremental technological change,
sustained over many years (often decades), is often the most
successful path to substantial long-term improvements in
performance and reductions in cost of a technology (Alic et al.,
2003). Such trends are commonly represented and quantified
in the form of a ‘learning curve’ or “experience curve’ showing
cost reductions as a function of the cumulative adoption of a
particular technology (McDonald and Schrattenholzer, 2001).
One recent study relevant to CO, capture systems found that
over the past 25 years, capital costs for sulphur dioxide (SO,)
and nitrogen oxides (NO,) capture systems at US coal-fired
power plants have decreased by an average of 12% for each
doubling of installed worldwide capacity (a surrogate for
cumulative experience, including investments in R&D) (Rubin
et al., 2004a). These capture technologies bear a number of
similarities to current systems for CO, capture. Another recent
study (IEA, 2004) suggests a 20% cost reduction for a doubling
of the unit capacity of engineered processes due to technological
learning. For CCS systems the importance of costs related to
energy requirements is emphasized, since reductions in such
costs are required to significantly reduce the overall cost of CO,

capture.

Compared to the current commercial plants in Table 3.11,
the advanced single-product systems with CO, capture have
hydrogen cost reductions of 16% (for natural gas feedstock) to
26% (for coal feedstock). Additional cases in Table 3.14 show

Improvements to current amine-based systems for post-
combustion CO, capture are being pursued by a number of
process developers (Mimura ef al., 2003; Muramatsu and
lijima, 2003; Reddy er al., 2003) and may offer the nearest-
term potential for cost reductions over the systems currently
in use. The newest systems summarized earlier in Table 3.7
reportedly reduce the cost of CO, avoided by approximately
20-30% (IEA GHG, 2004). Table 3.13 indicates that additional
advances in plant heat integration could further reduce the COE
of capture plants by about 5%. These results are consistent with

and a plant simulation model to quantify the improvements
likely achievable by 2015 for four key process parameters:
sorbent concentration, regeneration energy requirements,
sorbent loss and sorbent cost. The ‘most likely’ improvement
was an 18% reduction in COE, while the ‘optimistic’ estimates
yielded a 36% cost reduction from improvements in just these
four parameters. The cost of CO, avoided was reduced by
similar amounts. Advances in more efficient heat integration
(for sorbent regeneration) and higher power plant efficiency
could lead to even greater reductions in CO, capture cost.

For new plant applications, the data in Table 3.13 indicate
that oxy-fuel combustion adds about 30-90% to the capital cost
and 30-150% to the COE of a conventional plant, while reducing
CO, emissions per kWh by 75-100%. Retrofit applications
exhibit higher relative costs in cases where the existing plant is
wholly or partially amortized. The lowest-cost oxy-fuel system
in Table 3.13 is one that employs chemical looping to achieve
nearly a 100% reduction in CO, emissions. While this concept
thus appears promising (see Section 3.4.6), it has yet to be tested
and verified at a meaningful scale. Thus cost estimates based on

conceptual designs remain highly uncertain at this time.

"J3./.10.5 Advanced systems with pre-combustion capture

The cost of gasification-based systems with CO, capture also
can be expected to fall as a result of continued improvements
in gas turbine technology, gasifier designs, oxygen production
systems, carbon capture technology, energy management and
optimization of the overall facility. One recent study (IEA
GHG, 2003) estimates a 20% reduction in the cost of electricity
generation from a coal-based IGCC plant with CO, capture by
2020. This takes into account improvements in gasification,
oxygen production, physical solvent scrubbing and combined
cycle processes, but does not take into account any possible
radical innovations in CO, separation technology. The additional
IGCC cases shown in Table 3.13, including recent results of the
CO, Capture Project (CCP, 2005), foresee similar reductions in
the COE of advanced IGCC systems compared to the systems
in Table 3.10.
"	Text
"To judge the potential cost savings of oxy-fuels relative to
current CO, capture systems, it is useful to compare the costs
of alternative technologies evaluated within a particular study
based on a particular set of premises. In this regard, the COE
for the oxy-fuel retrofit system reported by Alstom et al. (2001)
in Table 3.13 is 20% lower than the cost of an amine system
retrofit (Table 3.13) for the same 255 MW plant, while the cost
of CO, avoided is 26% lower. In contrast, a recent study by
the Canadian Clean Power Coalition (Stobbs and Clark, 2005)
reports that the COE for an oxy-fuel system at a large lignite-
fired plant (Table 3.13) is 36% higher than for an amine CO,
capture system, while the cost of CO, avoided is more than
twice as great. The major source of that cost difference was a
specification in the CCPC study that the oxy-fuelled unit also
be capable of full air firing. This resulted in a much higher
capital cost than for a new unit designed solely for oxy-fuel
operation. A more recent study sponsored by IEA GHG (Dillon
et al., 2005) found that a large new supercritical coal-fired
boiler with oxy-fuel combustion had a COE slightly (2-3%)
lower than a state-of-the-art coal plant with post-combustion
analyzed in a separate study employing similar assumptions
(IEA GHG, 2004). Further cost reductions could be achieved
with the successful development of new lower-cost oxygen
production technology (see Section 3.4.5). At the current time,
the optimum designs of oxy-fuel combustion systems are not
yet well established and costs of proposed commercial designs
remain uncertain. This is especially true for advanced design
concepts that employ components which are not yet available
or still in the development stage, such as CO, gas turbines or
high temperature ceramic membranes for oxygen production.

In contrast to new plants, CO, capture options and costs for
existing power plants have not been extensively studied. Current
studies indicate that these costs are extremely site-specific and
fall into two categories (see Table 3.8). One is the retrofitting of
a post-combustion capture system to the existing unit.

Table 3.15 also shows that the lowest CO, capture costs with
current technology (as low as 2 US$/tCO, captured or avoided)
were found for industrial processes such as coal-based hydrogen
production plants that produce concentrated CO, streams as
part of the production process. Such industrial processes may
Tepresent some of the earliest opportunities for CCS.

"As noted earlier, CO, capture for industrial processes has not
been widely studied. The most extensive analyses have focused
on petroleum refineries, especially CO, capture options for
heaters and other combustion-based processes (see Table 3.12).
The use of oxy-fuel combustion offers potential cost savings in
several industrial applications. The CO, Capture Project reports
the cost of capturing CO, in refinery heaters and boilers, with
an ion transport membrane oxygen plant, to be 31 US$/tCO,
avoided. The cost of pre-combustion capture based on shift and
membrane gas separation was predicted to be 41 US$/tCO,
avoided (CCP, 2005).

"It also may be possible to apply oxy-fuel combustion to
cement plants, but the CO, partial pressure in the cement kiln
would be higher than normal and the effects of this on the
calcination reactions and the quality of the cement product
would need to be investigated. The quantity of oxygen required
per tonne of CO, captured in a cement plant would be only about
half as much as in a power plant, because only about half of the
CO, is produced by fuel combustion. This implies that the cost
of CO, capture by oxy-fuel combustion at large cement plants
would be lower than at power plants, but a detailed engineering
cost study is lacking. Emerging technologies that capture CO,
using calcium-based sorbents, described in Section 3.3.3.4, may
be cost competitive in cement plants in the future.
"	Text
"Table 3.15 summarizes the range of current CO, capture costs
for the major electric power systems analyzed in this report.
These costs apply to case studies of large new plants employing
current commercial technologies. For the PC and IGCC systems,
the data in Table 3.15 apply only to plants using bituminous
coals and the PC plants are for supercritical units only. The cost
ranges for each of the three systems reflect differences in the
technical, economic and operating assumptions employed in
different studies. While some differences in reported costs can
be attributed to differences in the CO, capture system design,
the major sources of variability are differences in the assumed
design, operation and financing of the reference plant to which
the capture technology is applied (i.e., factors such as plant size,
location, efficiency, fuel type, fuel cost, capacity factor and cost
of capital). Because no single set of assumptions applies to all
situations or all parts of the world, we display the ranges of cost
represented by the studies in Tables 3.8, 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12.

Figure 3.20 displays the normalized power plant cost and
emissions data from Table 3.15 in graphical form. On this
graph, the cost of CO, avoided corresponds to the slope of a line
connecting any two plants (or points) of interest. While Table
3.15 compares a given capture plant to a similar plant without
capture, in some cases comparisons may be sought between
a given capture plant and a different type of reference plant.
Several cases are illustrated in Figure 3.20 based on either a
PC or NGCC reference plant. In each case, the COE and CO,
emission rate are highly dependent upon technical, economic
and financial factors related to the design and operation of the
power systems of interest at a particular location. The cost of
CO, avoided is especially sensitive to these site-specific factors
and can vary by an order of magnitude or more when different
types of plants are compared. Comparisons of different plant
types, therefore, require a specific context and geographical
location to be meaningful and should be based on the full COE
including CO, transport and storage costs. Later, Chapter 8
presents examples of full CCS costs for different plant types
and storage options.

"capture. The cost of electricity production attributed to CO,
capture increases by 35-70% for a natural gas combined cycle
plant, 40-85% for a new pulverized coal plant and 20-55% for an
integrated gasification combined cycle plant. Overall, the COE
for fossil fuel plants with capture ranges from 43-86 US$ MWh
‘as compared to 31-61 US$ MWh"" for similar plants without
capture. These costs include CO, compression but not transport
and storage costs. In most studies to date, NGCC systems
typically have a lower COE than new PC and IGCC plants (with
or without capture) for large base load plants with high capacity
factors (75% or more) and gas prices below about 4 US$ GJ!
over the life of the plant. However, for higher gas prices and/
or lower capacity factors, NGCC plants typically have higher
COEs than coal-based plants, with or without capture. Recent
studies also found that IGCC plants were on average slightly
more costly without capture and slightly less costly with capture
than similarly sized PC plants. However, the difference in cost
between PC and IGCC plants with or without CO, capture can
vary significantly with coal type and other local factors, such
as the cost of capital. Since neither PC nor IGCC systems have
yet been demonstrated with CO, capture and storage for a large
modern power plant (e.g., 500 MW), neither the absolute or
relative costs of these systems (nor comparably sized NGCC
systems with capture and storage) can be stated with a high degree

of confidence at this time, based on the criteria of Table 3.6.

effective. However, further site-specific studies are required

New or improved methods of CO, capture, combined with
advanced power systems and industrial process designs, promise
to significantly reduce CO, capture costs and associated energy
requirements. Tables 3.12 to 3.14 summarize the results from
recent studies that examine future options. As discussed earlier,
there is considerable uncertainty about the magnitude and
timing of future cost reductions, as well as the potential for costs
to rise above current estimates, especially for technologies still
in the early stages of research and development. The current
assessment is based on studies of the specific technologies

"Figure 3.20 Cost of electricity (excluding transport and storage costs) compared to CO, emission rate for different reference and capture plants
based on current technology. The shaded areas show the Table 3.15 ranges of CO, emission rates and levelized cost of electricity (COE) for new
PC, IGCC and NGCC plants with and without CO, capture. All coal plant data are for bituminous coals only. PC plants are supercritical units only
(see Tables 3.7, 3.9, 3.10 and 3.15 for additional assumptions). The cost of CO, avoided corresponds to the slope of a line connecting a plant with
capture and a reference plant without capture (i.e., the change in electricity cost divided by the change in emission rate). Avoidance costs for the
same type of plant with and without capture plant are given in Table 3.15. When comparing different plant types, the reference plant represents
the least-cost plant that would ‘normally’ be built at a particular location in the absence of a carbon constraint. In many regions today, this would
be either a PC plant or an NGCC plant. The cost per tonne of CO, avoided can be highly variable and depends strongly on the costs and emissions
of new plants being considered in a particular situation. See Chapter 8 for the full COE and full cost of CO, avoided for different plant types.

With reference to the development of novel CO, capture
and/or other enabling technologies, a wide range of options
are currently being investigated worldwide. However, many
technical details of the specific processes proposed or under
development for these emerging technologies are still not well
understood. This makes the assessment of their performance
and cost highly uncertain. This is where intense R&D is needed
to develop and bring to pilot scale testing the most promising
concepts for commercial application. Membranes for H,, CO,
or O, separation, new sorbents, O, or CO, solid carriers and
materials for advanced combustors, boilers and turbines all
require extensive performance testing. Multi-pollutant emission
controls in these novel systems and the impact of fuel impurities
and temperature on the functional materials, should also be an
area of future work.

In an ongoing search to implement existing, new or improved
methods of CO, capture, most capture systems also rely on the
application of a range of enabling technologies that influence the
attractiveness of a given system. These enabling technologies
have their own critical gaps of knowledge. For example,
improved processes for the effective removal of sulphur,
nitrogen, chlorine, mercury and other pollutants are needed for
the effective performance of unit operations for CO, separation
in post- and pre-combustion capture systems, especially when
coal is used as the primary fuel. Improved gasification reactors
for coals and biomass, the availability of hydrogen-burning gas
turbines and fuel cells for stationary power generation also need
further development in the pre-combustion route. Combustors
and boilers operating at higher temperatures, or a new class of
CO, turbines and compressors, are important requirements for
oxy-fuel systems.

Although many of the component and/or enabling
technologies required for CO, capture in post-combustion,
pre-combustion and oxy-fuel combustion are well known,
gaps in knowledge are in the practical and/or commercial
demonstration of integrated systems. This demonstration is
essential to prove the cost of CO, capture and its use on a large
scale, particularly in power generation applications, but also for
cement, steel and other large industries. Operating experience
is also needed to test system reliability, improved methods of
system integration, methods to reduce the energy requirements
for CO, capture, improved process control strategies and the
use of optimized functional materials for the implementation
of capture processes with advanced, higher efficiency power
cycles. As such developments are realized, environmental
issues associated with the capture of CO, and other deleterious
pollutants in these systems should also be re-assessed from
a perspective involving the whole capture-transport-storage
operation.

Dry carbon dioxide does not corrode the carbon-manganese

Gas transported at close to atmospheric pressure occupies
such a large volume that very large facilities are needed. Gas
occupies less volume if it is compressed, and compressed
gas is transported by pipeline. Volume can be further reduced
by liquefaction, solidification or hydration. Liquefaction is

This existing technology and experience can be transferred to
liquid CO, transport. Solidification needs much more energy

is currently used to transport carbon dioxide.

Research and development on a natural gas hydrate carrying
system intended to replace LNG systems is in progress, and the
results might be applied to CO, ship transport in the future. In
pipeline transportation, the volume is reduced by transporting
at a high pressure: this is routinely done in gas pipelines, where
operating pressures are between 10 and 80 MPa.

not necessarily apply to a CO, storage project. A low nitrogen
content is important for EOR, but would not be so significant
for CCS. A CO, pipeline through populated areas might have a
lower specified maximum H,S content.

"A transportation infrastructure that carries carbon dioxide
in large enough quantities to make a significant contribution
to climate change mitigation will require a large network of
pipelines. As growth continues it may become more difficult
to secure rights-of-way for the pipelines, particularly in highly
populated zones that produce large amounts of carbon dioxide.
Existing experience has been in zones with low population
densities, and safety issues will become more complex in

The most economical carbon dioxide capture systems
appear to favour CO, capture, first, from pure stream sources
such as hydrogen reformers and chemical plants, and then from
centralized power and synfuel plants: Chapter 2 discusses this
issue in detail. The producers of natural gas speak of ‘stranded’
reserves from which transport to market is uneconomical. A
movement towards a decentralized power supply grid may make
CO, capture and transport much more costly, and it is easy to
envision stranded CO, at sites where capture is uneconomic.

Liquefied natural gas and petroleum gases such as propane
and butane are routinely transported by marine tankers; this
trade already takes place on a very large scale. Carbon dioxide
is transported in the same way, but on a small scale because of
limited demand. The properties of liquefied carbon dioxide are
not greatly different from those of liquefied petroleum gases,
and the technology can be scaled up to large carbon dioxide
carriers. A design study discussed later has estimated costs
for marine transport of 1 MtCO, yr' by one 22,000 m? marine
tanker over a distance of 1100 km, along with the associated
liquefaction, loading and unloading systems.

"Transport is that stage of carbon capture and storage that links
sources and storage sites. The beginning and end of ‘transport’
may be defined administratively. “Transport’ is covered by
the regulatory framework concerned for public safety that
governs pipelines and shipping. In the context of long-distance
movement of large quantities of carbon dioxide, pipeline
transport is part of current practice. Pipelines routinely carry
large volumes of natural gas, oil, condensate and water over
distances of thousands of kilometres, both on land and in the
sea. Pipelines are laid in deserts, mountain ranges, heavily-
populated areas, farmland and the open range, in the Arctic and
sub-Arctic, and in seas and oceans up to 2200 m deep.

Carbon dioxide pipelines are not new: they now extend
over more than 2500 km in the western USA, where they carry
50 MtCO, yr! from natural sources to enhanced oil recovery
projects in the west Texas and elsewhere. The carbon dioxide
stream ought preferably to be dry and free of hydrogen sulphide,
because corrosion is then minimal, and it would be desirable to
establish a minimum specification for ‘pipeline quality’ carbon
dioxide. However, it would be possible to design a corrosion-
resistant pipeline that would operate safely with a gas that
contained water, hydrogen sulphide and other contaminants.
Pipeline transport of carbon dioxide through populated areas
requires attention be paid to design factors, to overpressure
protection, and to leak detection. There is no indication that the
problems for carbon dioxide pipelines are any more challenging
than those set by hydrocarbon pipelines in similar areas, or that
they cannot be resolved.

Corrosion rates are much higher if free water is present;
hydrates might also form. Seiersten (2001) measured a corrosion
rate of 0.7 mm yr' corrosion rate in 150 to 300 hours exposure
at 40°C in water equilibrated with CO, at 95 bar, and higher
rates at lower pressures. She found little difference between
carbon-manganese steel (American Petroleum Institute grade
X65) and 0.5 chromium corrosion-resistant alloy. It is unlikely
to be practicable to transport wet CO, in low-alloy carbon
steel pipelines because of this high corrosion rate. If the CO,
cannot be dried, it may be necessary to build the pipeline of a
corrosion-resistant alloy (‘stainless steel’). This is an established
technology. However the cost of steel has greatly increased

recently and this may not be economical.

"The physical, environmental and social factors that determine
the design of a pipeline are summarized in a design basis, which
then forms the input for the conceptual design. This includes a
system definition for the preliminary route and design aspects
for cost-estimating and concept-definition purposes. It is also
necessary to consider the process data defining the physical
characteristics of product mixture transported, the optimal
sizing and pressures for the pipeline, and the mechanical
design, such as operating, valves, pumps, compressors, seals,
etc. The topography of the pipeline right-of-way must be
examined. Topography may include mountains, deserts, river
and stream crossings, and for offshore pipelines, the differing
challenges of very deep or shallow water, and uneven seabed.
It is also important to include geotechnical considerations.
For example, is this pipeline to be constructed on thin soil
overlaying granite? The local environmental data need to be
included, as well as the annual variation in temperature during
operation and during construction, potentially unstable slopes,
frost heave and seismic activity. Also included are water depth,
sea currents, permafrost, ice gouging in Arctic seas, biological
growth, aquifers, and other environmental considerations such
as protected habitats. The next set of challenges is how the
pipeline will accommodate existing and future infrastructure —
road, rail, pipeline crossings, military/governmental restrictions
and the possible impact of other activities — as well as shipping
lanes, rural or urban settings, fishing restrictions, and conflicting
uses such as dredging. Finally, this integrated study will serve
as the basis for a safety review.

If the design requires that the pipeline be trenched, that is
usually done after it has been laid on the seabed, by a jetting
sled, a plough or a mechanical cutting device that is pulled
along the line. On the other hand, in shore crossings and in very
shallow water the trench is often excavated before the pipeline
is laid, and that is done by dredgers, backhoes or draglines in
soft sediments, or in rock by blasting followed by clamshell
excavators. Many shore crossings are drilled horizontally
from the shore; this procedure eliminates many uncertainties
associated with the surf zone, and reduces the environmental

method, in which 12 or 24 m lengths of pipe are brought to a
dynamically positioned or anchored barge, and welded one by

and the pipeline leaves the barge over the stern, and passes first
over a support structure (‘stinger’) and then down through the
water in a suspended span, until it reaches the seabed. Some
lines up to 450 mm diameter are constructed by the reel method,
in which the pipeline is welded together onshore, wound onto
a reel on a ship, and then unwound from the reel into its final
position. Some short lines and lines for shore crossings in

Annex I to this report includes the CO, phase diagram. At
atmospheric pressure, CO, is in gas or solid phase, depending
on the temperature. Lowering the temperature at atmospheric
pressure cannot by itself cause CO, to liquefy, but only to make
so-called ‘dry ice’ or solid CO,. Liquid CO, can only exist at
a combination of low temperature and pressures well above
atmospheric pressure. Hence, a CO, cargo tank should be of the
pressure-type or semi-refrigerated. The semi-refrigerated type
is preferred by ship designers, and the design point of the cargo
tank would be around —54 °C per 6 bar to -50°C per 7 bar, which
is near the point of CO,,. In a standard design, semi-refrigerated
type LPG carriers operate at a design point of -50°C and 7 bar,
when transporting a volume of 22,000 m*.

There are three types of tank structure for liquid gas transport
ships: pressure type, low temperature type and semi-refrigerated
type. The pressure type is designed to prevent the cargo gas from
boiling under ambient air conditions. On the other hand, the
low temperature type is designed to operate at a sufficiently low
temperature to keep cargo gas as a liquid under the atmospheric
pressure. Most small gas carriers are pressure type, and large
LPG and LNG carriers are of the low temperature type. The
low temperature type is suitable for mass transport because
the tank size restriction is not severe. The semi-refrigerated
type, including the existing CO, carriers, is designed taking
into consideration the combined conditions of temperature and
pressure necessary for cargo gas to be kept as a liquid. Some
tankers such as semi-refrigerated LPG carriers are designed for
applicability to the range of cargo conditions between normal
temperature/high pressure and low temperature/atmospheric
pressure.

Carbon dioxide leaking from a pipeline forms a potential
physiological hazard for humans and animals. The consequences
of CO, incidents can be modelled and assessed on a site-specific

local topography, meteorological conditions, population density
and other local conditions. A study by Vendrig et al. (2003)

A property of CO, that needs to be considered when selecting

Tankers can be seen to have higher standards than ships in
general. Stranding is the source of most of the tanker incidents
that have led to public concern. It can be controlled by careful
navigation along prescribed routes, and by rigorous standards
of operation. LNG tankers are potentially dangerous, but are
carefully designed and appear to be operated to very high
standards. There have been no accidental losses of cargo from
LNG ships. The LNG tanker E/ Paso Paul Kaiser ran aground
at 17 knots in 1979, and incurred substantial hull damage, but
the LNG tanks were not penetrated and no cargo was lost. There

incidents, with property damage totalling US$ 469,000, and no

However, unlike oil and gas, CO, does not form flammable or
explosive mixtures with air. Existing CO, pipelines are mainly
in areas of low population density, which would also tend to
result in lower average impacts. The reasons for the incidents
at CO, pipelines were relief valve failure (4 failures), weld/

force (1). In contrast, the principal cause of incidents for natural
gas pipelines is outside force, such as damage by excavator
buckets. Penetration by excavators can lead to loss of pipeline
fluid and sometimes to fractures that propagate great distances.
Preventative measures such as increasing the depth of cover
and use of concrete barriers above a pipeline and warning tape
can greatly reduce the risk. For example, increasing cover from
1 m to 2 m reduces the damage frequency by a factor of 10 in

harm. Pipelines are subject to environmental assessment. The
most significant aspect of the Convention is that it lays down
the general obligation of states to notify and consult each other
if a project under consideration is likely to have a significant
environmental impact across boundaries. In some cases the
acceptability of CO, storage under these conventions could
depend on the method of transportation to the storage site.
Conventions that are primarily concerned with discharge and
placement rather than transport are discussed in detail in the
chapters on ocean and geological storage.

In addition to the provisions of the Basel Convention, any
transport of CO, would have to comply with international
transport regulations. There are numerous specific agreements,
some of which are conventions and others protocols of other
conventions that apply depending on the mode of transport.
There are also a variety of regional agreements dealing with
transport of goods. International transport codes and agreements
adhere to the UN Recommendations on the Transport of
Dangerous Goods: Model Regulations published by the United
Nations (2001). CO, in gaseous and refrigerated liquid forms
is classified as a non-flammable, non-toxic gas; while solid
CO, (dry ice) is classified under the heading of miscellaneous
dangerous substances and articles. Any transportation of
CO, adhering to the Recommendations on the Transport of
Dangerous Goods: Model Regulations can be expected to meet
all relevant agreements and conventions covering transportation
by whatever means. Nothing in these recommendations would
imply that transportation of CO, would be prevented by
international transport agreements and conventions (IEA GHG,
2003a).

The cost of marine transport systems is not known in detail
at present, since no system has been implemented on a scale
required for CCS projects (i.e. in the range of several million
tonnes of carbon dioxide handling per year). Designs have been
submitted for tender, so a reasonable amount of knowledge is
available. Nevertheless, cost estimates vary widely, because
CO, shipping chains of this size have never been built and
economies of scale may be anticipated to have a major impact
on the costs.

It is cheaper to collect CO, from several sources into a single
pipeline than to transport smaller amounts separately. Early and
smaller projects will face relatively high transport costs, and
therefore be sensitive to transport distance, whereas an evolution
towards higher capacities (large and wide-spread application)
may result in a decrease in transport costs. Implementation of
a ‘backbone’ transport structure may facilitate access to large
remote storage reservoirs, but infrastructure of this kind will
require large initial upfront investment decisions. Further study
is required to determine the possible advantages of such pipeline
system.

A ship designed for carrying CO, from harbour to harbour
may cost about 30-50% more than a similar size semi-
refrigerated LPG ship (Statoil, 2004). However, since the
density of liquid CO, is about 1100 kg m*, CO, ships will carry
more mass than an equivalent LNG or LPG ship, where the
cargo density is about 500 kg m°. The estimated cost of ships
of 20 to 30 kt capacity is between 50 and 70 M$ (Statoil, 2004).
Another source (IEA GHG, 2004) estimates ship construction
costs at US$ 34 million for 10 kt-sized ship, US$ 60 million
with a capacity of 30 kt, or US$ 85 million with a capacity of
50 kt. A time charter rate of about 25,000 US$ day"" covering
capital charges, manning and maintenance is not unreasonable
for a ship in the 20 kt carrying capacity range.

"Public concern could highlight the issue of leakage of CO,
from transportation systems, either by rupture or minor leaks,
as discussed in Section 4.4. It is possible that standards may be
changed in future to address specific public concerns. Odorants
are often added to domestic low-pressure gas distribution
systems, but not to gas in long-distance pipelines; they could,
in principle, be added to CO, in pipelines. Mercaptans,
naturally present in the Weyburn pipeline system, are the
most effective odorants but are not generally suitable for this
application because they are degraded by O,, even at very low
concentrations (Katz, 1959). Disulphides, thioethers and ring
compounds containing sulphur are alternatives. The value and

the number of wells needed for injection and whether the
project is onshore or offshore — but costs for storage, including
monitoring, appear to lie in the range of 0.6-8.3 US$/tCO,

While there are uncertainties, the global capacity to store
CO, deep underground is large. Depleted oil and gas reservoirs
are estimated to have a storage capacity of 675-900 GtCO,.
Deep saline formations are very likely to have a storage capacity
of at least 1000 GtCO, and some studies suggest it may be an
order of magnitude greater than this, but quantification of the
upper range is difficult until additional studies are undertaken.
Capacity of unminable coal formations is uncertain, with
estimates ranging from as little as 3 GtCO, up to 200 GtCO,,.
Potential storage sites are likely to be broadly distributed in
many of the world’s sedimentary basins, located in the same
region as many of the world’s emission sources and are likely to
be adequate to store a significant proportion of those emissions
well into the future.

"In areas with suitable hydrocarbon accumulations, CO,-
EOR may be implemented because of the added economic
benefit of incremental oil production, which may offset some
of the costs of CO, capture, transport and injection. Storage
of CO, in coal beds, in conjunction with enhanced coal bed
methane (ECBM) production, is potentially attractive because
of the prospect of enhanced production of methane, the
cleanest of the fossil fuels. This technology, however, is not
well developed and a better understanding of injection and
storage processes in coals is needed. Carbon dioxide storage
in depleted oil and gas reservoirs is very promising in some
areas, because these structures are well known and significant
infrastructures are already in place. Nevertheless, relatively
few hydrocarbon reservoirs are currently depleted or near
depletion and CO, storage will have to be staged to fit the time
of reservoir availability. Deep saline formations are believed to
have by far the largest capacity for CO, storage and are much
more widespread than other options.

Injection of CO, in deep geological formations uses
technologies that have been developed for and applied by,
the oil and gas industry. Well-drilling technology, injection
technology, computer simulation of storage reservoir dynamics
and monitoring methods can potentially be adapted from
existing applications to meet the needs of geological storage.
Beyond conventional oil and gas technology, other successful
underground injection practices — including natural gas storage,
acid gas disposal and deep injection of liquid wastes — as well as
the industry’s extensive experience with subsurface disposal of
oil-field brines, can provide useful information about designing
programmes for long-term storage of CO,. Geological storage
of CO, is in practice today beneath the North Sea, where nearly
1 MtCO, has been successfully injected annually at Sleipner
since 1996 and in Algeria at the In-Salah gas field. Carbon
dioxide is also injected underground to recover oil. About 30
Mt of non-anthropogenic CO, are injected annually, mostly
in west Texas, to recover oil from over 50 individual projects,
some of which started in the early 1970s. The Weyburn Project

"Underground accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO,) is a
widespread geological phenomenon, with natural trapping of CO,
in underground reservoirs. Information and experience gained
from the injection and/or storage of CO, from a large number
of existing enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and acid gas projects,
as well as from the Sleipner, Weyburn and In Salah projects,
indicate that it is feasible to store CO, in geological formations
as a CO, mitigation option. Industrial analogues, including
underground natural gas storage projects around the world and
acid gas injection projects, provide additional indications that
CO, can be safely injected and stored at well-characterized and
properly managed sites. While there are differences between
natural accumulations and engineered storage, injecting CO, into
deep geological formations at carefully selected sites can store
it underground for long periods of time: it is considered likely
that 99% or more of the injected CO, will be retained for 1000
years. Depleted oil and gas reservoirs, possibly coal formations
and particularly saline formations (deep underground porous
reservoir rocks saturated with brackish water or brine), can
be used for storage of CO,. At depths below about 800-1000
m, supercritical CO, has a liquid-like density that provides the
potential for efficient utilization of underground storage space
in the pores of sedimentary rocks. Carbon dioxide can remain
trapped underground by virtue of a number of mechanisms, such
as: trapping below an impermeable, confining layer (caprock);
retention as an immobile phase trapped in the pore spaces
of the storage formation; dissolution in the in situ formation
fluids; and/or adsorption onto organic matter in coal and shale.
Additionally, it may be trapped by reacting with the minerals
in the storage formation and caprock to produce carbonate
minerals. Models are available to predict what happens when
CO, is injected underground. Also, by avoiding deteriorated
wells or open fractures or faults, injected CO, will be retained
for very long periods of time. Moreover, CO, becomes less
mobile over time as a result of multiple trapping mechanisms,
further lowering the prospect of leakage.

responsibility for storage. A number of international laws that
predate any consideration of CO, storage are relevant to offshore
geological storage; consideration of whether these laws do or
do not permit offshore geological storage is under way.

The subsurface is the Earth’s largest carbon reservoir, where
the vast majority of the world’s carbon is held in coals, oil, gas
organic-rich shales and carbonate rocks. Geological storage of
CO, has been a natural process in the Earth’s upper crust for
hundreds of millions of years. Carbon dioxide derived from
biological activity, igneous activity and chemical reactions
between rocks and fluids accumulates in the natural subsurface
environment as carbonate minerals, in solution or in a gaseous
or supercritical form, either as a gas mixture or as pure CO,.
The engineered injection of CO, into subsurface geological
formations was first undertaken in Texas, USA, in the early
1970s, as part of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects and has
been ongoing there and at many other locations ever since.

of geological settings in sedimentary basins. Within these
basins, oil fields, depleted gas fields, deep coal seams and saline

To geologically store CO,, it must first be compressed,
usually to a dense fluid state known as ‘supercritical’ (see
Glossary). Depending on the rate that temperature increases
with depth (the geothermal gradient), the density of CO, will
increase with depth, until at about 800 m or greater, the injected
CO, will be in a dense supercritical state (Figure 5.2).

In this chapter, we primarily consider storage of pure
or nearly pure, CO,. It has been suggested that it may be
economically favourable to co-store CO, along with H,S, SO,
or NO,,. Since only a few scientific studies have evaluated the
impacts of these added constituents on storage performance or
risks, they are not addressed comprehensively here. Moreover,
the limited information gained from practical experience with
acid gas injection in Canada is insufficient to assess the impacts
of the added components on storage security.

It is also important to know how securely and for how long
stored CO, will be retained — for decades, centuries, millennia or
for geological time? To assure public safety, storage sites must
be designed and operated to minimize the possibility of leakage.
Consequently, potential leakage pathways must be identified
and procedures must be established, to set appropriate design
and operational standards as well as monitoring, measurement
and verification requirements. Sections 5.4, 5.6 and 5.7 consider
these issues.

Subsurface geological storage is possible both onshore
and offshore, with offshore sites accessed through pipelines
from the shore or from offshore platforms. The continental
shelf and some adjacent deep-marine sedimentary basins are
potential offshore storage sites, but the majority of sediments
of the abyssal deep ocean floor are too thin and impermeable
to be suitable for geological storage (Cook and Carleton,
2000). In addition to storage in sedimentary formations, some
consideration has been given to storage in caverns, basalt and
organic-rich shales (Section 5.3. 5).

But what is the world’s geological storage capacity and
does it occur where we need it? These questions were first
raised in Chapter 2, but Section 5.3.8 of this chapter considers
geographical matching of CO, sources to geological storage
sites in detail. Not all sedimentary basins are suitable for CO,
storage; some are too shallow and others are dominated by
rocks with low permeability or poor confining characteristics.
Basins suitable for CO, storage have characteristics such as
thick accumulations of sediments, permeable rock formations
saturated with saline water (saline formations), extensive covers
of low porosity rocks (acting as seals) and structural simplicity.

"grown from a concept of limited interest to one that is quite
widely regarded as a potentially important mitigation option
(Figure 5.1). There are several reasons for this. First, as research
has progressed and as demonstration and commercial projects
have been successfully undertaken, the level of confidence
in the technology has increased. Second, there is consensus
that a broad portfolio of mitigation options is needed. Third,
geological storage (in conjunction with CO, capture) could help
to make deep cuts to atmospheric CO, emissions. However,
if that potential is to be realized, the technique must be safe,
environmentally sustainable, cost-effective and capable of
being broadly applied. This chapter explores these issues.

"Fluids have been injected on a massive scale into the deep
subsurface for many years to dispose of unwanted chemicals,
pollutants or by-products of petroleum production, to enhance
the production of oil and gas or to recharge depleted formations
(Wilson et al., 2003). The principles involved in such activities
are well established and in most countries there are regulations
governing these activities. Natural gas has also been injected
and stored in the subsurface on a large scale in many parts of the
world for many years. Injection of CO, to date has been done at
arelatively small scale, but if it were to be used to significantly
decrease emissions from existing stationary sources, then the
injection rates would have to be at a scale similar to other
injection operations under way at present.

Is there likely to be sufficient storage capacity to meet the
world’s needs in the years ahead? To consider this issue, itis useful
to draw parallels with the terms ‘resources’ and ‘reserves’ used
for mineral deposits (McKelvey, 1972). Deposits of minerals or
fossil fuels are often cited with very large resource figures, but
the ‘proven’ reserve is only some fraction of the resource. The
resource figures are based on the selling price of the commodity,
the cost of exploiting the commodity, the availability of
appropriate technologies, proof that the commodity exists
and whether the environmental or social impact of exploiting
the commodity is acceptable to the community. Similarly, to
turn technical geological storage capacity into economical
storage capacity, the storage project must be economically
viable, technically feasible, safe, environmentally and socially
sustainable and acceptable to the community. Given these
constraints, it is inevitable that the storage capacity that will
actually be used will be significantly less than the technical
potential. Section 5.3 explores this issue. It is likely that usable
storage capacity will exist in many areas where people live and
where CO, is generated from large stationary sources. This
geographical congruence of storage-need and storage-capacity
should not come as a surprise, because much of the world’s
population is concentrated in regions underlain by sedimentary
basins (Gunter et al., 2004).

is separated, then injected into a large, deep, saline formation 800 m below the seabed of the North Sea. The Saline Aquifer
CO, Storage (SACS) project was established to monitor and research the storage of CO,. From 1995, the IEA Greenhouse
Gas R&D Programme has worked with Statoil to arrange the monitoring and research activities. Approximately 1 MtCO, is
removed from the produced natural gas and injected underground annually in the field. The CO, injection operation started
in October 1996 and, by early 2005, more than 7 MtCO, had been injected at a rate of approximately 2700 t day"". Over the
lifetime of the project, a total of 20 MtCO, is expected to be stored. A simplified diagram of the Sleipner scheme is given in

At the northern limit of the reservoir, the carbonate thins against a regional unconformity. The basal seal is also anhydrite, but

controlled by the contrast in mobility of CO, and the in situ

"The rate of fluid flow depends on the number and properties of
the fluid phases present in the formation. When two or more
fluids mix in any proportion, they are referred to as miscible
fluids. If they do not mix, they are referred to as immiscible.
The presence of several different phases may decrease the
permeability and slow the rate of migration. If CO, is injected
into a gas reservoir, a single miscible fluid phase consisting of
natural gas and CO, is formed locally. When CO, is injected into
a deep saline formation in a liquid or liquid-like supercritical
dense phase, it is immiscible in water. Carbon dioxide injected
into an oil reservoir may be miscible or immiscible, depending
on the oil composition and the pressure and temperature of the

In saline formations and oil reservoirs, the buoyant plume of
injected CO, migrates upwards, but not evenly. This is because
a lower permeability layer acts as a barrier and causes the
CO, to migrate laterally, filling any stratigraphic or structural
trap it encounters. The shape of the CO, plume rising through
the rock matrix (Figure 5.6) is strongly affected by formation
heterogeneity, such as low-permeability shale lenses (Flett er al.,
2005). Low-permeability layers within the storage formation
therefore have the effect of slowing the upward migration of
CO,, which would otherwise cause CO, to bypass deeper parts
of the storage formation (Doughty et al., 2001).

As CO, migrates through a formation, some of it is retained
in the pore space by capillary forces (Figure 5.6), commonly
referred to as ‘residual CO, trapping’, which may immobilize
significant amounts of CO, (Obdam er al., 2003; Kumar er al.,
2005). Figure 5.8 illustrates that when the degree of trapping
is high and CO, is injected at the bottom of a thick formation,
all of the CO, may be trapped by this mechanism, even before
it reaches the caprock at the top of the formation. While this
effect is formation-specific, Holtz (2002) has demonstrated
that residual CO, saturations may be as high as 15-25% for
many typical storage formations. Over time, much of the

As CO, migrates through the formation, some of it will
dissolve into the formation water. In systems with slowly
flowing water, reservoir-scale numerical simulations show
that, over tens of years, a significant amount, up to 30% of the
injected CO,, will dissolve in formation water (Doughty er al.,
2001). Basin-scale simulations suggest that over centuries, the
entire CO, plume dissolves in formation water (McPherson
and Cole, 2000; Ennis-King ef al., 2003). If the injected
CO, is contained in a closed structure (no flow of formation
water), it will take much longer for CO, to completely dissolve
because of reduced contact with unsaturated formation water.
Once CO, is dissolved in the formation fluid, it migrates along
with the regional groundwater flow. For deep sedimentary
basins characterized by low permeability and high salinity,
groundwater flow velocities are very low, typically on the order

"Water saturated with CO, is slightly denser (approximately
1%) than the original formation water, depending on salinity
(Enick and Klara, 1990; Bachu and Adams, 2003). With
high vertical permeability, this may lead to free convection,
replacing the CO,-saturated water from the plume vicinity with
unsaturated water, producing faster rates of CO, dissolution
(Lindeberg and Wessel-Berg, 1997; Ennis-King and Paterson,
2003). Figure 5.7 illustrates the formation of convection cells
and dissolution of CO, over several thousand years. The
solubility of CO, in brine decreases with increasing pressure,
decreasing temperature and increasing salinity (Annex 1).
Calculations indicate that, depending on the salinity and depth,
20-60 kgCO, can dissolve in 1 m° of formation fluid (Holt et
al., 1995; Koide et al., 1995). With the use of a homogeneous
model rather than a heterogeneous one, the time required for

complete CO, dissolution may be underestimated.

In the longer term, significant quantities of CO, dissolve in
the formation water and then migrate with the groundwater.

"J.2.4.f Fhysical trapping: siratigrapnic and structurat
Initially, physical trapping of CO, below low-permeability seals
(caprocks), such as very-low-permeability shale or salt beds,
is the principal means to store CO, in geological formations
(Figure 5.3). In some high latitude areas, shallow gas hydrates
may conceivably act as a seal. Sedimentary basins have such
closed, physically bound traps or structures, which are occupied
mainly by saline water, oil and gas. Structural traps include
those formed by folded or fractured rocks. Faults can act as
permeability barriers in some circumstances and as preferential
pathways for fluid flow in other circumstances (Salvieral.,2000).
Stratigraphic traps are formed by changes in rock type caused
by variation in the setting where the rocks were deposited. Both
of these types of traps are suitable for CO, storage, although,
as discussed in Section 5.5, care must be taken not to exceed
the allowable overpressure to avoid fracturing the caprock or
re-activating faults (Streit et al., 2005).

Carbon dioxide in the subsurface can undergo a sequence of
geochemical interactions with the rock and formation water that
will further increase storage capacity and effectiveness. First,
when CO, dissolves in formation water, a process commonly
called solubility trapping occurs. The primary benefit of
solubility trapping is that once CO, is dissolved, it no longer
exists as a separate phase, thereby eliminating the buoyant
forces that drive it upwards. Next, it will form ionic species as
the rock dissolves, accompanied by a rise in the pH. Finally,
some fraction may be converted to stable carbonate minerals
(mineral trapping), the most permanent form of geological
storage (Gunter ef al., 1993). Mineral trapping is believed to
be comparatively slow, potentially taking a thousand years
or longer. Nevertheless, the permanence of mineral storage,
combined with the potentially large storage capacity present in
some geological settings, makes this a desirable feature of long-
term storage.

Underground natural gas storage projects that offer experience
relevant to CO, storage (Lippmann and Benson, 2003; Perry,
2005) have operated successfully for almost 100 years and in
many parts of the world (Figure 5.12). These projects provide for
peak loads and balance seasonal fluctuations in gas supply and
demand. The Berlin Natural Gas Storage Project is an example
of this (Box 5.5). The majority of gas storage projects are in
depleted oil and gas reservoirs and saline formations, although
caverns in salt have also been used extensively. A number of
factors are critical to the success of these projects, including
a suitable and adequately characterized site (permeability,
thickness and extent of storage reservoir, tightness of caprock,
geological structure, lithology, etc.). Injection wells must be
properly designed, installed, monitored and maintained and
abandoned wells in and near the project must be located and
plugged. Finally, taking into account a range of solubility,
density and trapping conditions, overpressuring the storage

Conversely, some systems, typically spas and
volcanic systems, are leaky and not useful analogues for
geological storage. The Kileaua Volcano emits on average
4 MtCO, yr'. More than 1200 tCO, day-' (438,000 tCO, yr')
leaked into the Mammoth Mountain area, California, between
1990 and 1995, with flux variations linked to seismicity (USGS,

observed near Matraderecske, Hungary, but along faults, the
flux density can reach approximately 6600 t m® yr! (Pearce et
al., 2003). These high seepage rates result from release of CO,
from faulted volcanic systems, whereas a normal baseline CO,
flux is of the order of 10-100 gCO, m® day under temperate
climate conditions (Pizzino er al., 2002). Seepage of CO, into
Lake Nyos (Cameroon) resulted in CO, saturation of water
deep in the lake, which in 1987 produced a very large-scale and
(for more than 1700 persons) ultimately fatal release of CO,
when the lake overturned (Kling ef al., 1987). The overturn of
Lake Nyos (a deep, stratified tropical lake) and release of CO,
are not representative of the seepage through wells or fractures
that may occur from underground geological storage sites.
Engineered CO, storage sites will be chosen to minimize the
prospect of leakage. Natural storage and events such as Lake
Nyos are not representative of geological storage for predicting
seepage from engineered sites, but can be useful for studying
the health, safety and environmental effects of CO, leakage
(Section 5.7.4).

For enhanced CO, storage in EOR operations, oil reservoirs

Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) through CO, flooding (by
injection) offers potential economic gain from incremental
oil production. Of the original oil in place, 540% is usually
recovered by conventional primary production (Holt et al.,
1995). An additional 10-20% of oil in place is produced by
secondary recovery that uses water flooding (Bondor, 1992).
Various miscible agents, among them CO,, have been used for
enhanced (tertiary) oil recovery or EOR, with an incremental
oil recovery of 7-23% (average 13.2%) of the original oil in

Many CO, injection schemes have been suggested,
including continuous CO, injection or alternate water and CO,
gas injection (Klins and Farougq Ali, 1982; Klins, 1984). Oil
displacement by CO, injection relies on the phase behaviour
of CO, and crude oil mixtures that are strongly dependent on
reservoir temperature, pressure and crude oil composition. These
mechanisms range from oil swelling and viscosity reduction for
injection of immiscible fluids (at low pressures) to completely
miscible displacement in high-pressure applications. In these
applications, more than 50% and up to 67% of the injected
CO, returns with the produced oil (Bondor, 1992) and is
usually separated and re-injected into the reservoir to minimize
operating costs. The remainder is trapped in the oil reservoir by
various means, such as irreducible saturation and dissolution in
reservoir oil that it is not produced and in pore space that is not
connected to the flow path for the producing wells.

The possible presence e of fossil fuels and the exploration
and production maturity of a basin are additional considerations
for selection of storage sites (Bachu, 2000). Basins with little
exploration for hydrocarbons may be uncertain targets for CO,
storage because of limited availability of geological information
or potential for contamination of as-yet-undiscovered
hydrocarbon resources. Mature sedimentary basins may be
prime targets for CO, storage because: (1) they have well-known
characteristics; (2) hydrocarbon pools and/or coal beds have
been discovered and produced; (3) some petroleum reservoirs
might be already depleted, nearing depletion or abandoned as
uneconomic; (4) the infrastructure needed for CO, transport
and injection may already be in place. The presence of wells
penetrating the subsurface in mature sedimentary basins can
create potential CO, leakage pathways that may compromise the
security of a storage site (Celia and Bachu, 2003). Nevertheless,

wells, after four years of CO, injection there has been no

Reservoir heterogeneity also affects CO, storage efficiency.

The density difference between the lighter co, and the reservoir
oil and water leads to movement of the CO, along the top of the
reservoir, particularly if the reservoir is relatively homogeneous
and has high permeability, negatively affecting the CO, storage
and oil recovery. Consequently, reservoir heterogeneity may
have a positive effect, slowing down the rise of CO, to the top
of the reservoir and forcing it to spread laterally, giving more
complete invasion of the formation and greater storage potential

The fate and transport of the Sleipner CO, plume has been
successfully monitored (Figure 5.16) by seismic time-lapse
surveys (Section 5.6). These surveys have helped improve
the conceptual model for the fate and transport of stored CO,.
The vertical cross-section of the plume shown in Figure 5.16
indicates both the upward migration of CO, (due to buoyancy
forces) and the role of lower permeability strata within the
formation, diverting some of the CO, laterally, thus spreading
out the plume over a larger area. The survey also shows that the
caprock prevents migration out of the storage formation. The
seismic data shown in Figure 5.16 illustrate the gradual growth of
the plume. Today, the footprint of the plume at Sleipner extends
over approximately 5 km’. Reservoir studies and simulations
(Section 5.4.2) have shown that the CO,-saturated brine will
eventually become denser and sink, eliminating the potential
for long-term leakage (Lindeberg and Bergmo, 2003).

"Saline formations are deep sedimentary rocks saturated with
formation waters or brines containing high concentrations of
dissolved salts. These formations are widespread and contain
enormous quantities of water, but are unsuitable for agriculture
or human consumption. Saline brines are used locally by the
chemical industry and formation waters of varying salinity are
used in health spas and for producing low-enthalpy geothermal
energy. Because the use of geothermal energy is likely to
increase, potential geothermal areas may not be suitable for CO,
storage. It has been suggested that combined geological storage
and geothermal energy may be feasible, but regions with good
geothermal energy potential are generally less favourable for
CO, geological storage because of the high degree of faulting
and fracturing and the sharp increase of temperature with depth.
In very arid regions, deep saline formations may be considered

for future water desalinization.

The process of CO, trapping in coals for temperatures
and pressures above the critical point is not well understood
(Larsen, 2003). It seems that adsorption is gradually replaced by
absorption and the CO, diffuses or ‘dissolves’ in coal. Carbon
dioxide is a ‘plasticizer’ for coal, lowering the temperature
required to cause the transition from a glassy, brittle structure
to a rubbery, plastic structure (coal softening). In one case, the
transition temperature was interpreted to drop from about 400°C
at 3 MPa to <30°C at 5.5 MPa CO, pressure (Larsen, 2003). The
transition temperature is dependent on the maturity of the coal,
the maceral content, the ash content and the confining stress
and is not easily extrapolated to the field. Coal plasticization
or softening, may adversely affect the permeability that
would allow CO, injection. Furthermore, coal swells as CO,
is adsorbed and/or absorbed, which reduces permeability and
injectivity by orders of magnitude or more (Shi and Durucan,
2005) and which may be counteracted by increasing the injection
pressures (Clarkson and Bustin, 1997; Palmer and Mansoori,
1998; Krooss et al., 2002; Larsen, 2003). Some studies suggest
that the injected CO, may react with coal (Zhang et al., 1993),
further highlighting the difficulty in injecting CO, into low-
permeability coal.

Deposits of oil or gas shale or organic-rich shale, occur in many
parts of the world. The trapping mechanism for oil shale is
similar to that for coal beds, namely CO, adsorption onto organic
material. Carbon dioxide-enhanced shale-gas production (like
ECBM) has the potential to reduce storage costs. The potential
for storage of CO, in oil or gas shale is currently unknown, but
the large volumes of shale suggest that storage capacity may be
significant. If site-selection criteria, such as minimum depth, are

This study provides evidence of significant coal-permeability reduction with CO, injection. This permeability reduction
resulted in a two-fold reduction in injectivity. This effect compromised incremental methane recovery and project economics.
Finding ways to overcome and/or prevent this effect is therefore an important topic for future research. The injection of CO,
at the Allison Unit has resulted in an increase in methane recovery from an estimated 77% of original gas in place to 95% of
the original gas in place within the project area. The recovery of methane was in a proportion of approximately one volume of

In EOR operations, impurities affect the oil recovery
because they change the solubility of CO, in oil and the ability
of CO, to vaporize oil components (Metcalfe, 1982). Methane
and nitrogen decrease oil recovery, whereas hydrogen sulphide,
propane and heavier hydrocarbons have the opposite effect
(Alston et al., 1985; Sebastian et al., 1985). The presence of
SO, may improve oil recovery, whereas the presence of NO,
can retard miscibility and thus reduce oil recovery (Bryant

In the case of CO, storage in coal seams, impurities may also

a higher affinity to coal than CO,, thus reducing the storage
capacity for CO, (Chikatamarla and Bustin, 2003). If oxygen
is present, it will react irreversibly with the coal, reducing the
sorption surface and, hence, the adsorption capacity. On the
other hand, some impure CO, waste streams, such as coal-fired

suggest that SO, injection with CO, produces substantially
different chemical, mobilization and mineral reactions. Clarity
is needed about the range of gas compositions that industry

The suitability of mines for CO, storage depends on the nature
and sealing capacity of the rock in which mining occurs.
Heavily fractured rock, typical of igneous and metamorphic
terrains, would be difficult to seal. Mines in sedimentary rocks
may offer some CO,-storage opportunities (e.g., potash and
salt mines or stratabound lead and zinc deposits). Abandoned
coal mines offer the opportunity to store CO,, with the added
benefit of adsorption of CO, onto coal remaining in the mined-
out area (Piessens and Dusar, 2004). However, the rocks above
coal mines are strongly fractured, which increases the risk
of gas leakage. In addition, long-term, safe, high-pressure,
CO,-resistant shaft seals have not been developed and any
shaft failure could result in release of large quantities of CO,.
Nevertheless, in Colorado, USA, there is a natural gas storage
facility in an abandoned coal mine.

"Storage of CO, in salt caverns created by solution mining could
use the technology developed for the storage of liquid natural
gas and petroleum products in salt beds and domes in Western
Canada and the Gulf of Mexico (Dusseault et al., 2004). A single
salt cavern can reach more than 500,000 m*. Storage of CO, in
salt caverns differs from natural gas and compressed air storage
because in the latter case, the caverns are cyclically pressurized
and depressurized on a daily-to-annual time scale, whereas
CO, storage must be effective on a centuries-to-millennia time
scale. Owing to the creep properties of salt, a cavern filled with
supercritical CO, will decrease in volume, until the pressure
inside the cavern equalizes the external stress in the salt bed
(Bachu and Dusseault, 2005). Although a single cavern 100 m
in diameter may hold only about 0.5 Mt of high density CO,,
arrays of caverns could be built for large-scale storage. Cavern
sealing is important in preventing leakage and collapse of cavern
roofs, which could release large quantities of gas (Katzung et al.,
1996). Advantages of CO, storage in salt caverns include high
capacity per unit volume (kgCO, mr*), efficiency and injection
flow rate. Disadvantages are the potential for CO, release in
the case of system failure, the relatively small capacity of most
individual caverns and the environmental problems of disposing
of brine from a solution cavity. Salt caverns can also be used for
temporary storage of CO, in collector and distributor systems
between sources and sinks of CO,,.

Many storage-capacity estimates for oil and gas fields do

to be produced and that will become available in future years.
In some global assessments, estimates also attribute capacity
to undiscovered oil and gas fields that might be discovered in
future years. There is uncertainty about when oil and gas fields
will be depleted and become available for CO, storage. The
depletion of oil and gas fields is mostly affected by economic
rather than technical considerations, particularly oil and gas
prices. It is possible that production from near-depleted fields
will be extended if future economic considerations allow more
hydrocarbons to be recovered, thus delaying access to such
fields for CO, storage. Currently few of the world’s large oil

Carbon dioxide density was calculated from the depth, pressure
and temperature of fields in most cases; where these were not
available, a density of 700 kg m> was used. No assumption was
made about the amount of oil recovered from the fields before
CO, storage was initiated and tertiary recovery by EOR was not
included. In Western Canada, the practical CO, storage potential

reservoirs and about 4 GtCO, in gas reservoirs. The capacity in
all discovered oil and gas reservoirs is approximately 10 GtCO,
(Bachu et al., 2004; Bachu and Shaw, 2005). For Canada, the
CO, density was calculated for each reservoir from the pressure
and temperature. The oil and gas recovery was that provided
in the reserves databases or was based on actual production.
For reservoirs suitable for EOR, an analytical method was
developed to estimate how much would be produced and how
much CO, would be stored (Shaw and Bachu, 2002). In the
United States, the total storage capacity in discovered oil and
gas fields is estimated to be approximately 98 GtCO, (Winter

To date, most of the estimates of CO, storage capacity
in deep saline formations focus on physical trapping and/or
dissolution. These estimates make the simplifying assumption
that no geochemical reactions take place concurrent with CO,
injection, flow and dissolution. Some recent work suggests that
it can take several thousand years for geochemical reactions to
have a significant impact (Xu er al., 2003). The CO, storage
capacity from mineral trapping can be comparable to the
capacity in solution per unit volume of sedimentary rock when
formation porosity is taken into account (Bachu and Adams,
2003; Perkins et al., 2005), although the rates and time frames
of these two processes are different.

Within these wide ranges, the lower figure is generally the
estimated storage capacity of volumetric traps within the deep
saline formations, where free-phase CO, would accumulate. The
larger figure is based on additional storage mechanisms, mainly
dissolution but also mineral trapping. The various methods and
data used in these capacity estimates demonstrate a high degree
of uncertainty in estimating regional or global storage capacity
in deep saline formations. In the examples from Europe and
Japan, the maximum estimate is 15 to 50 times larger than the
low estimate. Similarly, global estimates of storage capacity
show a wide range, 100—200,000 GtCO,, reflecting different
methodologies, levels of uncertainties and considerations of
effective trapping mechanisms.

The assessment of this report is that it is very likely that
global storage capacity in deep saline formations is at least 1000
GtCO,. Confidence in this assessment comes from the fact that
oil and gas fields ‘discovered’ have a global storage capacity
of approximately 675-900 GtCO, and that they occupy only
a small fraction of the pore volume in sedimentary basins, the
rest being occupied by brackish water and brine. Moreover,
oil and gas reservoirs occur only in about half of the world’s
sedimentary basins. Additionally, regional estimates suggest
that significant storage capacity is available. Significantly
more storage capacity is likely to be available in deep saline
formations. The literature is not adequate to support a robust
estimate of the maximum geological storage capacity. Some
studies suggest that it might be little more than 1000 GtCO,,
while others indicate that the upper figure could be an order
of magnitude higher. More detailed regional and local capacity
assessments are required to resolve this issue.

"More than 14 global assessments of capacity have been
made by using these types of approaches (IEA-GHG, 2004).
The range of estimates from these studies is large (200-56,000
GtCO,), reflecting both the different assumptions used to make
these estimates and the uncertainty in the parameters. Most of
the estimates are in the range of several hundred Gtonnes of
CO,. Volumetric capacity estimates that are based on local,
reservoir-scale numerical simulations of CO, injection suggest
occupancy of the pore space by CO, on the order of a few percent
as a result of gravity segregation and viscous fingering (van
der Meer, 1992, 1995; Krom et al., 1993; Ispen and Jacobsen,
1996). Koide et al. (1992) used the areal method of projecting
natural resources reserves and assumed that 1% of the total area
of the world’s sedimentary basins can be used for CO, storage.
Other studies considered that 2-6% of formation area can be
used for CO, storage. However, Bradshaw and Dance (2005)
have shown there is no correlation between geographic area of a
sedimentary basin and its capacity for either hydrocarbons (oil
and gas reserves) or CO, storage.

assumed to be proportional to the total pore volume, which
may not necessarily be correct. Early estimates of the total US
storage capacity in deep saline formations suggested a total of
up to 500 GtCO, (Bergman and Winter, 1995). A more recent
estimate of the capacity of a single deep formation in the United
States, the Mount Simon Sandstone, is 160-800 GtCO, (Gupta
et al., 1999), suggesting that the total US storage capacity
may be higher than earlier estimates. Assuming that CO, will
dissolve to saturation in all deep formations, Bachu and Adams
(2003) estimated the storage capacity of the Alberta basin in
Western Canada to be approximately 4000 GtCO,, which is a
theoretical maximum assuming that all the pore water in the
Alberta Basin could become saturated with CO,, which is not
likely. An Australian storage capacity estimate of 740 GtCO,
was determined by a cumulative risked-capacity approach for
65 potentially viable sites from 48 basins (Bradshaw et al.,
2003). The total capacity in Japan has been estimated as 1.5—-80
GtCO,, mostly in offshore formations (Tanaka et al., 1995).

Matching sources of CO, to potential storage sites, taking into
account projections for future socio-economic development,
will be particularly important for some of the rapidly
developing economies. Assessment of sources and storage
sites, together with numerical simulations, emissions mapping
and identification of transport routes, has been undertaken for
a number of regions in Europe (Holloway, 1996; Larsen et
al., 2005). In Japan, studies have modelled and optimized the
linkages between 20 onshore emission regions and 20 offshore
storage regions, including both ocean storage and geological
storage (Akimoto ef al., 2003). Preliminary studies have also
begun in India (Garg ef al., 2005) and Argentina (Amadeo et
al., 2005). For the United States, a study that used a Geographic
Information System (GIS) and a broad-based economic analysis
(Dooley et al., 2005) shows that about two-thirds of power
stations are adjacent to potential geological storage locations,
but a number would require transportation of hundreds of

"Assuming that bituminous coals can adsorb twice as much
CO, as methane, a preliminary analysis of the theoretical CO,
storage potential for ECBM recovery projects suggests that
approximately 60-200 GtCO, could be stored worldwide
in bituminous coal seams (IEA-GHG, 1998). More recent
estimates for North America range from 60 to 90 GtCO, (Reeves,
2003b; Dooley et al., 2005), by including sub-bituminous
coals and lignites. Technical and economic considerations
suggest a practical storage potential of approximately 7 GtCO,
for bituminous coals (Gale and Freund, 2001; Gale, 2004).
Assuming that CO, would not be stored in coal seams without
recovering the CBM, a storage capacity of 3-15 GtCO, is
calculated, for a US annual production of CBM in 2003 of
approximately 0.04 trillion m? and projected global production
levels of 0.20 trillion m® in the future. This calculation assumes
that 0.1 GtCO, can be stored for every Tcf of produced CBM

checks to large storage-capacity estimates and indicate which

mechanism and the geological medium in which storage is
proposed (e.g., deep saline formation, depleted oil or gas field or

each of these options (Table 5.3). In many cases, oil and gas
fields will be better characterized than deep saline formations
because a relevant data set was collected during hydrocarbon

storage formation and caprock also need to be assessed because

in the opening of fractures or failure along a fault plane.

Methods have been described for making field-scale
measurements of the permeability of caprocks for formation
gas storage projects, based on theoretical developments in the
1950s and 1960s (Hantush and Jacobs, 1955; Hantush, 1960).
These use water-pumping tests to measure the rate of leakage
across the caprock (Witherspoon et al., 1968). A related type
of test, called a pressure ‘leak-off’ test, can be used to measure
caprock permeability and in situ stress. The capacity of a seal
rock to hold back fluids can also be estimated from core samples
by mercury injection capillary pressure (MICP) analysis, a
method widely used in the oil and gas industry (Vavra et al.,
1992). MICP analysis measures the pressures required to move
mercury through the pore network system of a seal rock. The
resulting data can be used to derive the height of a column of
reservoir rock saturated by a particular fluid (e.g., CO,) that the
sealing strata would be capable of holding back (Gibson-Poole
et al., 2002).

"The efficacy of an oil or gas field seal rock can be
characterized by examining its capillary entry pressure and the
potential hydrocarbon column height that it can sustain (see
above). However, Jimenez and Chalaturnyk (2003) suggest that
the geomechanical processes, during depletion and subsequent
CO, injection, may affect the hydraulic integrity of the seal
rock in hydrocarbon fields. Movement along faults can be
produced in a hydrocarbon field by induced changes in the pre-
production stress regime. This can happen when fluid pressures
are substantially depleted during hydrocarbon production
(Streit and Hillis, 2003). Determining whether the induced
stress changes result in compaction or pore collapse is critical
in assessment of a depleted field. If pore collapse occurs, then
it might not be possible to return a pressure-depleted field to
its original pore pressure without the risk of induced failure.
By having a reduced maximum pore fluid pressure, the total
volume of CO, that can be stored in a depleted field could be
substantially less than otherwise estimated.

the condition of abandoned and active wells is an important
component of site characterization. It is possible to locate
abandoned wells with airborne magnetometer surveys. In
most cases, abandoned wells will have metal casings, but this
may not be the case for wells drilled long ago or those never
completed for oil or gas production. Countries with oil and gas
production will have at least some records of the more recently
drilled wells, depth of wells and other information stored in
a geographic database. The consistency and quality of record
keeping of drilled wells (oil and gas, mining exploration and
water) varies considerably, from excellent for recent wells
to nonexistent, particularly for older wells (Stenhouse ef al.,
2004).

"A carbonate mineral formation effectively traps stored CO,
as an immobile solid phase (Section 5.2). If the mineralogical
composition of the rock matrix is strongly dominated by quartz,
geochemical reactions will be dominated by simple dissolution
into the brine and CO,-water-rock reactions can be neglected.
In this case, complex geochemical simulations of rock-water
interactions will not be needed. However, for more complex
mineralogies, sophisticated simulations, based on laboratory
experimental data that use reservoir and caprock samples and
native pore fluids, may be necessary to fully assess the potential
effects of such reactions in more complex systems (Bachu et al.,
1994; Czernichowski-Lauriol et al., 1996; Rochelle et al., 1999,
2004; Gunter et al., 2000). Studies of rock samples recovered
from natural systems rich in CO, can provide indications of
what reactions might occur in the very long term (Pearce et al.,
1996). Reactions in boreholes are considered by Crolet (1983),
Rochelle et al. (2004) and Schremp and Roberson (1975).
Natural CO, reservoirs also allow sampling of solid and fluid
reactants and reaction products, thus allowing formulation
of geochemical models that can be verified with numerical
simulations, further facilitating quantitative predictions of
water-CO,-rock reactions (May, 1998).

Another, similar intercomparison study was conducted
for simulation of storage of CO, in coal beds, considering
both pure CO, injection and injection of flue gases (Law et
al., 2003). Again, there was good agreement between the
simulation results from different codes. Code intercomparisons
are useful for checking mathematical methods and numerical
approximations and to provide insight into relevant phenomena
by using the different descriptions of the physics (or chemistry)
implemented. However, establishing the realism and accuracy
of physical and chemical process models is a more demanding
task, one that requires carefully controlled and monitored field

been shown to be capable of adequately representing real-world

The principal difficulty is that the complex geological
models on which the simulation models are based are subject
to considerable uncertainties, resulting both from uncertainties
in data interpretation and, in some cases, sparse data sets.
Measurements taken at wells provide information on rock
and fluid properties at that location, but statistical techniques
must be used to estimate properties away from the wells. When
simulating a field in which injection or production is already
occurring, a standard approach in the oil and gas industry is
to adjust some parameters of the geological model to match
selected field observations. This does not prove that the model is
correct, but it does provide additional constraints on the model
parameters. In the case of saline formation storage, history
matching is generally not feasible for constraining uncertainties,
due to a lack of underground data for comparison. Systematic
parameter variation routines and statistical functions should
be included in future coupled simulators to allow uncertainty
estimates for numerical reservoir simulation results.

take hundreds to thousands of years. However, the simulation
of important mechanisms, such as the convective mixing
of dissolved CO,, can be tested by comparison to laboratory
analogues (Ennis-King and Paterson, 2003). Another possible
route is to match simulations to the geochemical changes
that have occurred in appropriate natural underground
accumulations of CO,, such as the precipitation of carbonate
minerals, since these provide evidence for the slow processes
that affect the long-term distribution of CO, (Johnson er al.,
2005). It is also important to have reliable and accurate data
regarding the thermophysical properties of CO, and mixtures
of CO, with methane, water and potential contaminants such
as H,S and SO,. Similarly, it is important to have data on
relative permeability and capillary pressure under drainage
and imbibition conditions. Code comparison studies show that
the largest discrepancies between different simulators can be
traced to uncertainties in these parameters (Pruess et al., 2004).
For sites where few, if any, CO,-water-rock interactions occur,
reactive chemical transport modelling may not be needed and
simpler simulations that consider only CO,-water reactions will
suffice.

"The number of wells required for a storage project will
depend on a number of factors, including total injection
rate, permeability and thickness of the formation, maximum
injection pressures and availability of land-surface area for
the injection wells. In general, fewer wells will be needed for
high-permeability sediments in thick storage formations and for
those projects with horizontal wells for injection. For example,
the Sleipner Project, which injects CO, into a high-permeability,
200-m-thick formation uses only one well to inject | MtCO, yr!
(Korbol and Kaddour, 1994). In contrast, at the In Salah Project
in Algeria, CO, is injected into a 20-m-thick formation with
much lower permeability (Riddiford et al., 2003). Here, three
long-reach horizontal wells with slotted intervals over 1 km
are used to inject 1 MtCO, yr! (Figure 5.5). Cost will depend,
to some degree, on the number and completion techniques for
these wells. Therefore, careful design and optimization of the
number and slotted intervals is important for cost-effective
storage projects.

An injection well and a wellhead are depicted in Figure
5.20. Injection wells commonly are equipped with two valves
for well control, one for regular use and one reserved for safety
shutoff. In acid gas injection wells, a downhole safety valve
is incorporated in the tubing, so that if equipment fails at the
surface, the well is automatically shut down to prevent back
flow. Jarrell et al. (2002) recommend an automatic shutoff valve
on all CO, wells to ensure that no release occurs and to prevent
CO, from inadvertently flowing back into the injection system.
A typical downhole configuration for an injection well includes
a double-grip packer, an on-off tool and a downhole shutoff
valve. Annular pressure monitors help detect leaks in packers
and tubing, which is important for taking rapid corrective
action. To prevent dangerous high-pressure buildup on surface
equipment and avoid CO, releases into the atmosphere, CO,

"A theoretical case study of the Petrel Sub-basin offshore
northwest Australia examined the basin-wide storage potential
of a combined hydrodynamic and solution trapping mechanism
and identified how sensitive a reservoir simulation will be to
the collected data and models built during the characterization
of a storage site (Gibson-Poole er al., 2002; Ennis-King et al.,
2003). As at Sleipner, the Petrel study identified that vertical
permeability and shale beds within the reservoir interval of
the geological model strongly influenced the vertical CO,
migration rate. In the reservoir simulation, use of coarser grids
overestimated the dissolution rate of CO, during the injection
period, but underestimated it during the long-term migration
period. Lower values of residual CO, saturation led to faster
dissolution during the long-term migration period and the rate
of complete dissolution depended on the vertical permeability.
Migration distance depended on the rate of dissolution and
residual CO, trapping. The conclusion of the characterization
and performance prediction studies is that the Petrel Sub-
basin has a regionally extensive reservoir-seal pair suitable for
hydrodynamic trapping (Section 5.2). While the characterization
was performed on the basis of only a few wells with limited
data, analogue studies helped define the characteristics of the
formation. Although this is not the ideal situation, performing a
reservoir simulation by using geological analogues may often be
the only option. However, understanding which elements will
be the most sensitive in the simulation will help geoscientists
to understand where to prioritize their efforts in data collection
and interpretation.

effectively, a baseline survey must be taken. This survey
provides the point of comparison for subsequent surveys.
This is particularly true of seismic and other remote-sensing
technologies, where the identification of saturation of fluids with
CO, is based on comparative analysis. Baseline monitoring is also
a prerequisite for geochemical monitoring, where anomalies are
identified relative to background concentrations. Additionally,
establishing a baseline of CO, fluxes resulting from ecosystem
cycling of CO,, both on diurnal and annual cycles, are useful
for distinguishing natural fluxes from potential storage-related

releases.

"5.6.3.1 Direct techniques for monitoring CO, migration
Direct techniques for monitoring are limited in availability at
present. During CO, injection for EOR, the injected CO, spreads
through the reservoir in a heterogeneous manner, because of
permeability variations in the reservoir (Moberg et al., 2003). In
the case of CO,-EOR, once the CO, reaches a production well,
its produced volume can be readily determined. In the case of
Weyburn, the carbon in the injected CO, has a different isotopic
composition from the carbon in the reservoir (Emberley et al.,
2002), so the distribution of the CO, can be determined on a
gross basis by evaluating the arrival of the introduced CO, at
different production wells. With multiple injection wells in
any producing area, the arrival of CO, can give only a general
indication of distribution in the reservoir.

"Measurements of CO, injection rates are a common oil
field practice and instruments for this purpose are available
commercially. Measurements are made by gauges either at
the injection wellhead or near distribution manifolds. Typical
systems use orifice meters or other devices that relate the
pressure drop across the device to the flow rate. The accuracy of
the measurements depends on a number of factors that have been
described in general by Morrow et al. (2003) and specifically
for CO, by Wright and Majek (1998). For CO,, accurate
estimation of the density is most important for improving
measurement accuracy. Small changes in temperature, pressure
and composition can have large effects on density. Wright and
Majek (1998) developed an oil field CO, flow rate system by
combining pressure, temperature and differential pressure
measurements with gas chromatography. The improved system
had an accuracy of 0.6%, compared to 8% for the conventional
system. Standards for measurement accuracy vary and are
usually established by governments or industrial associations.
For example, in the United States, current auditing practices for
CO,-EOR accept flow meter precision of +4%.

A wide variety of pressure sensors are available and suitable
for monitoring pressures at the wellhead or in the formation.
Continuous data are available and typically transmitted to
a central control room. Surface pressure gauges are often
connected to shut-off valves that will stop or curtail injection
if the pressure exceeds a predetermined safe threshold or if
there is a drop in pressure as a result of a leak. In effect, surface
pressures can be used to ensure that downhole pressures do not

For CO, that has migrated even shallower in the subsurface,
its gas-like properties will vastly increase the detection limit;
hence, even smaller threshold levels of resolution are expected.
To date, no quantitative studies have been performed to establish

CO, gas, combined with its low density, indicate that much
lower levels of detection should be possible.

The use of passive seismic (microseismic) techniques
also has potential value. Passive seismic monitoring detects
microseismic events induced in the reservoir by dynamic
responses to the modification of pore pressures or the
reactivation or creation of small fractures. These discrete
microearthquakes, with magnitudes on the order of -4 to 0 on
the Richter scale (Wilson and Monea, 2005), are picked up by
static arrays of sensors, often cemented into abandoned wells.
These microseismic events are extremely small, but monitoring

For deep accumulations of CO, in the subsurface, where
CO, density approaches the density of fluids in the storage
formation, the sensitivity of surface seismic profiles would
suggest that resolution on the order of 2500—10,000 t of free-
phase CO, can be identified (Myer er al., 2003; White et al.,
2004; Arts et al., 2005). At Weyburn, areas with low injection
rates (<2% hydrocarbon pore volume) demonstrate little or no
visible seismic response. In areas with high injection rates (3—
13% hydrocarbon pore volume), significant seismic anomalies
are observed. Work at Sleipner shows that the CO, plume
comprises several distinct layers of CO,, each up to about 10
m thick. These are mostly beneath the strict limit of seismic
resolution, but amplitude studies suggest that layer thicknesses
as low as | m can be mapped (Arts ef al., 2005; Chadwick et
al., 2005). Seismic resolution will decrease with depth and

resolution will not apply uniformly in all storage scenarios. One

Non-seismic geophysical techniques include the use of
electrical and electromagnetic and self-potential techniques
(Benson et al., 2004; Hoversten and Gasperikova, 2005). In
addition, gravity techniques (ground or air-based) can be used
to determine the migration of the CO, plume in the subsurface.
Finally, tiltmeters or remote methods (geospatial surveys from
aircraft or satellites) for measuring ground distortion may be
used in some environments to assess subsurface movement of
the plume. Tiltmeters and other techniques are most applicable
in areas where natural variations in the surface, such as frost
heave or wetting-drying cycles, do not mask the changes that
occur from pressure changes. Gravity measurements will
respond to changes in the subsurface brought on by density
changes caused by the displacement of one fluid by another of
different density (e.g., CO, replacing water). Gravity is used
with numerical modelling to infer those changes in density
that best fit the observed data. The estimations of Benson et
al. (2004) suggest that gravity will not have the same level of
resolution as seismic, with minimum levels of CO, needed for
detection on the order of several hundred thousand tonnes (an
order of magnitude greater than seismic). This may be adequate
for plume movement, but not for the early definition of possible
leaks. A seabed gravity survey was acquired at Sleipner in 2002
and a repeat survey is planned for 2005. Results from these

"9.0.5.2 indirect techniques jor monitoring CU, migration
Indirect techniques for measuring CO, distribution in the
subsurface include a variety of seismic and non-seismic
geophysical and geochemical techniques (Benson et al., 2004;
Arts and Winthaegen, 2005; Hoversten and Gasperikova, 2005).
Seismic techniques basically measure the velocity and energy
absorption of waves, generated artificially or naturally, through
rocks. The transmission is modified by the nature of the rock
and its contained fluids. In general, energy waves are generated
artificially by explosions or ground vibration. Wave generators
and sensors may be on the surface (conventional seismic) or
modified with the sensors in wells within the subsurface and
the source on the surface (vertical seismic profiling). It is also
possible to place both sensors and sources in the subsurface
to transmit the wave pulses horizontally through the reservoir
(inter-well or cross-well tomography). By taking a series of
surveys over time, it is possible to trace the distribution of
the CO, in the reservoir, assuming the free-phase CO, volume
at the site is sufficiently high to identify from the processed
data. A baseline survey with no CO, present provides the basis
against which comparisons can be made. It would appear that
relatively low volumes of free-phase CO, (approximately 5%
or more) may be identified by these seismic techniques; at
present, attempts are being made to quantify the amount of CO,
in the pore space of the rocks and the distribution within the
reservoir (Hoversten et al., 2003). A number of techniques have
been actively tested at Weyburn (Section 5.6.3.3), including
time-lapse surface three-dimensional seismic (both 3- and 9-
component), at one-year intervals (baseline and baseline plus
one and two years), vertical seismic profiling and cross-well
(horizontal and vertical) tomography between pairs of wells.

leakage shortly after it leaks and long before the CO, enters
the groundwater aquifer, so that measures can be taken to

stable isotopes (e.g., °C, 'C, '8O, 7H) and gases, including
hydrocarbon gases, CO, and its associated isotopes (Gunter et

occurs, samples could be analyzed for trace elements such as
arsenic and lead, which are mobilized by acidic water (Section
5.5). Methods such as atomic absorption and inductively
coupled plasma mass spectroscopy self-potential can be used
to accurately measure water quality. Less sensitive field tests
or other analytical methods are also available (Clesceri et al.,

Miles et al. (2005) concluded that eddy covariance is
promising for the monitoring of CO, storage projects, both for
hazardous leaks and for leaks that would damage the economic
viability of geological storage. For a storage project of 100 Mt,
Miles et al. (2005) estimate that, for leakage rates of 0.01%
yr', fluxes will range from 1 to 10‘ times the magnitude of
typical ecological fluxes (depending on the size of the area
over which CO, is leaking). Note that a leakage rate of 0.01%
yr! is equivalent to a fraction retained of 90% over 1000 years.
This should easily be detectable if background ecological
fluxes are measured in advance to determine diurnal and annual
cycles. However, with the technology currently available to us,
quantifying leakage rates for tracking returns to the atmosphere
is likely to be more of a challenge than identifying leaks in the
storage reservoir.

of CO, that may lead to releases that could impact long-term
storage security and safety, as well as trigger the need for
remedial action. Long-term monitoring can be accomplished
with the same suite of monitoring technologies used during
the injection phase. However, at the present time, there are
no established protocols for the kind of monitoring that will
be required, by whom, for how long and with what purpose.
Geological storage of CO, may persist over many millions
of years. The long duration of storage raises some questions
about long-term monitoring — an issue that is also addressed in

Current projects, in particular Sleipner and Weyburn, are
testing a variety of techniques to determine those that are most
effective and least costly. In Western Canada, acid-gas injection
wells use pressure monitoring and set maximum wellhead
injection pressures to ensure that reservoir fracture pressures are
not exceeded. No subsurface monitoring is currently required
for these projects. Chalaturnyk and Gunter (2005) suggest that
an effectively designed monitoring programme should allow
decisions to be made in the future that are based on ongoing
interpretation of the data. The data from the programme should
also provide the information necessary to decrease uncertainties
over time or increase monitoring demand if things develop
unexpectedly. The corollary to this is that unexpected changes
may result in the requirement of increased monitoring until new
uncertainties are resolved.

"Several studies have attempted to address these issues. Keith
and Wilson (2002) have proposed that governments assume
responsibility for monitoring after the active phase of the storage
project is over, as long as all regulatory requirements have been
met during operation. This study did not, however, specify long-
term requirements for monitoring. Though perhaps somewhat
impractical in terms of implementation, White et al. (2003)
suggested that monitoring might be required for thousands of
years. An alternative point of view is presented by Chow et al.
(2003) and Benson et al. (2004), who suggest that once it has
been demonstrated that the plume of CO, is no longer moving,
further monitoring should not be required. The rationale for this
point of view is that long-term monitoring provides little value
if the plume is no longer migrating or the cessation of migration
can be accurately predicted and verified by a combination of

modelling and short- to mid-term monitoring.

"There are currently no standard protocols or established network
designs for monitoring leakage of CO,. Monitoring network
design will depend on the objectives and requirements of the
monitoring programme, which will be determined by regulatory
requirements and perceived risks posed by the site (Chalaturnyk
and Gunter, 2005). For example, current monitoring for EOR
is designed to assess the sweep efficiency of the solvent flood
and to deal with health and safety issues. In this regard, the
monitoring designed for the Weyburn Project uses seismic
surveys to determine the lateral migration of CO, over time.
This is compared with the simulations undertaken to design the
operational practices of the CO, flood. For health and safety, the
programme is designed to test groundwater for contamination
and to monitor for gas buildup in working areas of the field to
ensure worker safety. The surface procedure also uses pressure
monitoring to ensure that the fracture pressure of the formation
is not exceeded (Chalaturnyk and Gunter, 2005).

The Weyburn Project is designed to assess the integrity of an
oil reservoir for long-term storage of CO, (Wilson and Monea,
2005). In this regard, the demonstrated ability of seismic
surveys to measure migration of CO, within the formation is
important, but in the long term it may be more important to
detect CO, that has leaked out of the storage reservoir. In this
case, the monitoring programme should be designed to achieve
the resolution and sensitivity needed to detect CO, that has
leaked out of the reservoir and is migrating vertically. The use of
geochemical monitoring will determine the rate of dissolution
of the CO, into fluids and the capacity of the minerals within
the reservoir to react with the CO, and permanently store it.
For identification of potential CO, leaks, monitoring includes
soil gas and groundwater surveys. The soil gas surveys use a
grid pattern superimposed on the field to evaluate any change
in gas chemistry. Because grid patterns may miss narrow, linear
anomalies, the study also looks at the pattern of linear anomalies
on the surface that may reflect deeper fault and fracture systems,
which could become natural migration pathways.

If and when long-te -term monitoring is required, cost-effective,
easily deployed methods for monitoring will be preferred.
Methods that do not require wells that penetrate the plume will
be desirable, because they will not increase the risk of leakage
up the monitoring well itself. Technologies are available today,
such as 3D seismic imaging, that can provide satisfactory images
of CO, plume location. While seismic surveys are perceived to
be costly, a recent study by Benson et al. (2004) suggests that
this may be a misconception and indicates that monitoring costs
on a discounted basis (10% discount rate) are likely to be no
higher than 0.10 US$/tCO, stored. However, seismic imaging
has its limitations, as is evidenced by continued drilling of
non-productive hydrocarbon wells, but confidence in its ability
to meet most, but not all, of the needs of monitoring CO,
storage projects is growing. Less expensive and more passive
alternatives that could be deployed remotely, such as satellite-
based systems, may be desirable, but are not currently able to
track underground migration. However, if CO, has seeped to
the surface, associated vegetative stress can be detected readily
in some ecosystems (Martini a and Silver, 2002).

Risks are proportional to the magnitude of the potential
hazards and the probability that these hazards will occur. For
hazards that arise from locally elevated CO, concentrations — in
the near-surface atmosphere, soil gas or in aqueous solution
— the risks depend on the probability of leakage from the deep
storage site to the surface. Thus, most of the hazards described
in Section 5.7.4 should be weighted by the probability of release
described in Section 5.7.3. Regarding those risks associated
with routine operation of the facility and well maintenance, such
risks are expected to be comparable to CO,-EOR operations.

There are two important exceptions to the rule that risk is
proportional to the probability of release. First, local impacts
will be strongly dependent on the spatial and temporal
distribution of fluxes and the resulting CO, concentrations.
Episodic and localized seepage will likely tend to have more
significant impacts per unit of CO, released than will seepage
that is continuous and or spatially dispersed. Global impacts
arising from release of CO, to the atmosphere depend only on
the average quantity released over time scales of decades to
centuries. Second, the hazards arising from displacement, such
as the risk of induced seismicity, are roughly independent of the
probability of release.

No standard protocols have been developed specifically
for verification of geological storage. However, experience at
the Weyburn and Sleipner projects has demonstrated the utility
of various techniques for most if not all aspects of verification
(Wilson and Monea, 2005; Sleipner Best Practice Manual,
2004). At the very least, verification will require measurement
of the quantity of CO, stored. Demonstrating that it remains
within the storage site, from both a lateral and vertical migration
perspective, is likely to require some combination of models
and monitoring. Requirements may be site-specific, depending
on the regulatory environment, requirements for economic
instruments and the degree of risk of leakage. The oversight
for verification may be handled by regulators, either directly

The vadose zone is only partly saturated with water; the
rest of the pore space is filled with soil gas (air). Because it is
heavier than air, CO, will displace ambient soil gas, leading to
concentrations that locally may potentially approach 100% in
parts of the vadose zone, even for small leakage fluxes. The
dissipating effects of seepage into the surface layer are controlled
mostly by pressure-driven flow and diffusion (Oldenburg and
Unger, 2003). These occur predominantly in most shallow
parts of the vadose zone, leaving the deeper part of the vadose
zone potentially subject to accumulation of leaking CO,. The
processes of CO, migration in the vadose zone can be modelled,
subject to limitations in the characterization of actual complex

Once through the vadose zone, escaping CO, reaches the
surface layer of the atmosphere and the surface environment,
where humans and other animals can be exposed to it. Carbon
dioxide dispersion and mixing result from surface winds and
associated turbulence and eddies. As a result, CO, concentrations
diminish rapidly with elevation, meaning that ground-dwelling
animals are more likely to be affected by exposure than are
humans (Oldenburg and Unger, 2004). Calm conditions and
local topography capable of containing the dense gas will tend
to prevent mixing. But such conditions are the exception and in
general, the surface layer can be counted on to strongly dilute
seeping CO,,. Nevertheless, potential concerns related to buildup
of CO, concentrations on calm days must be carefully considered
in any risk assessment of a CO, storage site. Additionally, high
subsurface CO, concentrations may accumulate in basements,
subsurface vaults and other subsurface infrastructures where

humans may be exposed t to risk.

The risk of leakage through abandoned wells is proportional
to the number of wells intersected by the CO, plume, their depth
and the abandonment method used. For mature sedimentary
basins, the number of wells in proximity to a possible injection
well can be large, on the order of many hundreds. For example,
in the Alberta Basin in western Canada, more than 350,000 wells
have been drilled. Currently, drilling continues at the rate of
approximately 20,000 wells per year. The wells are distributed
spatially in clusters, with densities that average around four
wells per km? (Gasda et al., 2004). Worldwide well densities
are provided in Figure 5.27 and illustrate that many areas have
much lower well density. Nevertheless, the data provided in

present), thereby reducing the risk of leakage. Perhaps the only
respect in which gas storage systems present lower risks is that

storage facilities are currently operating in the United States

significant leakage: five were related to wellbore integrity, each
of which was resolved by reworking the wells; three arose from
leaks in caprocks, two of which were remediated and one of
which led to project abandonment. The final incident involved
early project abandonment owing to poor site selection (Perry,

relatively well understood (AI.3.3). At concentrations above
about 2%, CO, has a strong effect on respiratory physiology and

air will be strongly influenced by surface topography and
atmospheric conditions. Because CO, is 50% denser than air,

In saline formations or oil and gas reservoirs with significant

The time scale for dissolution is typically short compared to
the time for CO, to migrate out of the storage formation by
other processes (Ennis-King and Paterson, 2003; Lindeberg and
Bergmo, 2003; Walton et al., 2005). It is expected that many
storage projects could be selected and operated so that a very
large fraction of the injected CO, will dissolve. Once dissolved,
CO, can eventually be transported out of the injection site by
basin-scale circulation or upward migration, but the time scales
(millions of years) of such transport are typically sufficiently
long that they can (arguably) be ignored in assessing the risk of
leakage.

Simulations designed to explore the possible release of stored
CO, to the biosphere by multiple routes, including abandoned
wells and other disturbances, have recently become available
as a component of more general risk assessment activities
(Section 5.7.5). Two studies of the Weyburn site, for example,
assessed the probability of release to the biosphere. Walton et
al. (2005) used a fully probabilistic model, with a simplified
representation of CO, transport, to compute a probability
distribution for the cumulative fraction released to the biosphere.
Walton et al. found that after 5000 years, the probability was
equal that the cumulative amount released would be larger or
smaller than 0.1% (the median release fraction) and found a
95% probability that <1% of the total amount stored would be
released. Using a deterministic model of CO, transport in the
subsurface, Zhou et al. (2005) found no release to the biosphere
in 5000 years. While using a probabilistic model of transport
through abandoned wells, they found a statistical mean release
of 0.001% and a maximum release of 0.14% (expressed as the
cumulative fraction of stored CO, released over 5000 years).

Natural and engineered analogues show that it is possible,

releases of natural accumulations of CO, have occurred,
associated with volcanism or subsurface mining activities. Thus,
they are of limited relevance to understanding risks arising from

Wang and Jaffé (2004) used a chemical transport model to
investigate the effect of releasing CO, from a point source at
100 m depth into a shallow water formation that contained a
high concentration of mineralized lead (galena). They found
that in weakly buffered formations, the escaping CO, could
mobilize sufficient dissolved lead to pose a health hazard
over a radius of a few hundred metres from the CO, source.
This analysis represents an extreme upper bound to the risk
of metal leaching, since few natural formations have mineral
composition so susceptible to the effects of CO,-mediated
leaching and one of the expressed requirements of a storage
site is to avoid compromising other potential resources, such as
mineral deposits.

CO, in natural formations

The lifetime of CO, in natural formations (>10 million yr in some cases)
suggests an average release fraction <10” yr! for CO, trapped in sedimentary
basins. In highly fractured volcanic systems, rate of release can be many
orders of magnitude faster.

Stevens et al., 2001a; Baines

Oil and gas

The presence of buoyant fluids trapped for geological timescales
demonstrates the widespread presence of geological systems (seals and
caprock) that are capable of confining gasses with release rates <10” yr'.

Natural gas storage

The cumulative experience of natural gas storage systems exceeds 10,000
facility-years and demonstrates that operational engineered storage systems
can contain methane with release rates of 10“ to 10° yr'.

Enhanced oil recovery

More than 100 MtCO, has been injected for EOR. Data from the few sites
where surface fluxes have been measured suggest that fractional release rates
are near zero.

Moritis, 2002; Klusman,
2003

 

Models of flow through the
undisturbed subsurface

Numerical models show that release of CO, by subsurface flow through
undisturbed geological media (excluding wells) may be near zero at
appropriately selected storage sites and is very likely <10° in the few studies
that attempted probabilistic estimates.

Walton et al., 2005; Zhou

Bergmo, 2003; Cawley et al.,

Models of flow through
wells

Evidence from a small number of risk assessment studies suggests that
average release of CO, can be 10° to 10” yr! even in existing oil fields with
many abandoned wells, such as Weyburn. Simulations with idealized systems
with ‘open’ wells show that release rates can exceed 10°, though in practice
such wells would presumably be closed as soon as CO, was detected.

The main characteristic of long-term elevated CO, zones
at the surface is the lack of vegetation. New CO, releases into
vegetated areas cause noticeable die-off. In those areas where
significant impacts to vegetation have occurred, CO, makes up
about 20-95% of the soil gas, whereas normal soil gas usually
contains about 0.2-4% CO,. Carbon dioxide concentrations
above 5% may be dangerous for vegetation and as concentration
approach 20%, CO, becomes phytotoxic. Carbon dioxide can
cause death of plants through ‘root anoxia’, together with low
oxygen concentration (Leone et al., 1977; Flower et al., 1981).

Should CO, leak from the storage formation and find its way
to the surface, it will enter a much more biologically active area.
While elevated CO, concentrations in ambient air can accelerate
plant growth, such fertilization will generally be overwhelmed
by the detrimental effects of elevated CO, in soils, because CO,
fluxes large enough to significantly increase concentrations
in the free air will typically be associated with much higher
CO, concentrations in soils. The effects of elevated CO,
concentrations would be mediated by several factors: the type
and density of vegetation; the exposure to other environmental

In the last three decades, microbes dubbed ‘extremophiles’,
living in environments where life was previously considered
impossible, have been identified in many underground habitats.
These microorganisms have limited nutrient supply and exhibit
very low metabolic rates (D’Hondt et al., 2002). Recent studies
have described populations in deep saline formations (Haveman
and Pedersen, 2001), oil and gas reservoirs (Orphan et al., 2000)
and sediments up to 850 m below the sea floor (Parkes et al.,
2000). The mass of subsurface microbes may well exceed the
mass of biota on the Earth’s surface (Whitman et al., 2001). The
working assumption may be that unless there are conditions
preventing it, microbes can be found everywhere at the depths
being considered for CO, storage and consequently CO, storage
sites may generally contain microbes that could be affected by
injected CO,.

As is the case for induced seismicity, the experience with
injection of different fluids provides an empirical basis for
assessing the likelihood that groundwater contamination will
occur by brine displacement. As discussed in Section 5.5 and
shown in Figure 5.22, the current site-specific injection rates
of fluids into the deep subsurface are roughly comparable to
the rates at which CO, would be injected if geological storage
were adopted for storage of CO, from large-scale power plants.
Contamination of eroundwaterby brines displaced from injection
wells is rare and it is therefore expected that contamination
arising from large-scale CO, storage activities would also be
rare. Density differences between CO, and other fluids with
which we have extensive experience do not compromise this
conclusion, because brine displacement is driven primarily by
the pressure/hydraulic head differential of the injected CO,, not
by buoyancy forces.

One example of plant die-off occurred at Mammoth
Mountain, California, USA, where a resurgence of volcanic
activity resulted in high CO, fluxes. In 1989, a series of small
earthquakes occurred near Mammoth Mountain. A year later, 4
ha of pine trees were discovered to be losing their needles and
by 1997, the area of dead and dying trees had expanded to 40
ha (Farrar et al., 1999). Soil CO, levels above 10-20% inhibit
root development and decrease water and nutrient uptake; soil
oil-gas testing at Mammoth Mountain in 1994 discovered soil
gas readings of up to 95% CO, by volume. Total CO, flux in the
affected areas averaged about 530 t day“! in 1996. Measurements
in 2001 showed soil CO, levels of 15-90%, with flux rates at
the largest affected area (Horseshoe Lake) averaging 90-100
tCO, day""! (Gerlach et al., 1999; Rogie er al., 2001). A study of
the impact of elevated CO, on soils found there was a lower pH
and higher moisture content in summer. Wells in the high CO,
area showed higher levels of silicon, aluminum, magnesium
and iron, consistent with enhanced weathering of the soils.
Tree-ring data show that CO, releases have occurred prior to
1990 (Cook et al., 2001). Data from airborne remote sensing
are now being used to map tree health and measure anomalous
CO, levels, which may help determine how CO, affects forest
ecosystems (Martini and Silver, 2002).

a CO, storage facility: the annual flow of CO, at the Mammoth

The monitoring of microseismic events, especially in the
vicinity of injection wells, can indicate whether pore fluid
pressures have locally exceeded the strength of faults, fractures
or intact rock. Acoustic transducers that record microseismic
events in monitoring wells of CO, storage sites can be used
to provide real-time control to keep injection pressures below
the levels that induce seismicity. Together with the modelling
techniques mentioned above, monitoring can reduce the chance
of damage to top seals and fault seals (at CO, storage sites)
caused by injection-related pore-pressure increases.

geomechanical methods have been identified for assessing the
stability of faults and estimating maximum sustainable pore-

pose a hazard to benthic environments and organisms as the
CO, moves from deep geological structures through benthic
sediments to the ocean. While leaking CO, might be hazardous
to the benthic environment, the seabed and overlying seawater
can also provide a barrier, reducing the escape of seeping CO,
to the atmosphere. These hazards are distinctly different from

permeability, thus providing pathways for unwanted CO,

quantitative risk assessment are directly applicable. Assessment

Under some circumstances, H,S, SO,, NO, and other trace
gases may be stored along with co, (Bryant and Lake, 2005;
Knauss et al., 2005) and this may affect the level of risk. For
example, H,S is considerably more toxic than CO, and well
blow-outs containing H,S may present higher risks than well
blow-outs from storage sites that contain only CO,. Similarly,
dissolution of SO, in groundwater creates a far stronger acid
than does dissolution of CO,; hence, the mobilization of metals
in groundwater and soils may be higher, leading to greater risk
of exposure to hazardous levels of trace metals. While there has
not been a systematic and comprehensive assessment of how
these additional constituents would affect the risks associated
with CO, storage, it is worth noting that at Weyburn, one of
the most carefully monitored CO, injection projects and one for
which a considerable effort has been devoted to risk assessment,
the injected gas contains approximately 2% H,S (Wilson

have assumed that only CO, is stored; therefore, insufficient
information is available to assess the risks associated with gas
impurities at the present time.

the processes included or excluded) will both be, in general,
uncertain. Risk analysis may or may not treat this uncertainty
explicitly. When risks are assessed deterministically, fixed
parameter values are chosen to represent the (often unknown)
probability distributions. Often the parameter values are
selected ‘conservatively’; that is, they are selected so that risks
are overestimated, although in practice such selections are
problematic because the relationship between the parameter
value and the risk may itself be uncertain.

Studies of natural and engineered analogues provide a strong
basis for understanding and quantifying the health, safety and
environmental risks that arise from CO, that seeps from the
shallow subsurface to the atmosphere. Natural analogues are
of less utility in assessing the likelihood of various processes
that transport CO, from the storage reservoir to the near-surface
environment. This is because the geological character of such
analogues (e.g., CO, transport and seepage in highly fractured
zones shaped by volcanism) will typically be very different
from sites chosen for geological storage. Engineered analogues
such as natural gas storage and CO,-EOR can provide a
basis for deriving quantitative probabilistic models of well
performance.

Description and status

 

Weyburn/ECOMatters

New model, CQUESTRA, developed to enable probabilistic risk assessment. A simple box model is used
with explicit representation of transport between boxes caused by failure of wells.

 

Weyburn/Monitor Scientific

Scenario-based modelling that uses an industry standard reservoir simulation tool (Eclipse3000) based on
a realistic model of known reservoir conditions. Initial treatment of wells involves assigning a uniform
permeability.

 

NGCAS/ECL technology

Probabilistic risk assessment using fault tree and FEP (features, events and processes) database. Initial study
focused on the Forties oil and gas field located offshore in the North Sea. Concluded that flow through
caprock transport by advection in formation waters not important, work on assessing leakage due to well
failures ongoing.

 

SAMARCADS (safety
aspects of CO, storage)

Methods and tools for HSE risk assessment applied to two storage systems an onshore gas storage facility
and an offshore formation.

 

RITE

Scenario-based analysis of leakage risks in a large offshore formation. Will assess scenarios involving rapid
release through faults activated by seismic events.

 

 

 

 

Battelle Probabilistic risk assessment of an onshore formation storage site that is intended to represent the
Mountaineer site.

GEODISC Completed a quantitative risk assessment for four sites in Australia: the Petrel Sub-basin; the Dongra

Leakage up

and spill points

¢ Lower injection pressure by injecting at a lower rate or through more wells (Buschbach and Bond, 1974);

¢ Lower reservoir pressure by removing water or other fluids from the storage structure;

¢ Intersect the leakage with extraction wells in the vicinity of the leak;

¢ Create a hydraulic barrier by increasing the reservoir pressure upstream of the leak;

¢ Lower the reservoir pressure by creating a pathway to access new compartments in the storage reservoir;

¢ Stop injection to stabilize the project;

* Stop injection, produce the CO, from the storage reservoir and reinject it back into a more suitable storage structure.

 

Leakage through
active or
abandoned wells

¢ Repair leaking injection wells with standard well recompletion techniques such as replacing the injection tubing and
packers;

¢ Repair leaking injection wells by squeezing cement behind the well casing to plug leaks behind the casing;

¢ Plug and abandon injection wells that cannot be repaired by the methods listed above;

¢ Stop blow-outs from injection or abandoned wells with standard techniques to ‘kill’ a well such as injecting a heavy
mud into the well casing. After control of the well is re-established, the recompletion or abandonment practices
described above can be used. If the wellhead is not accessible, a nearby well can be drilled to intercept the casing
below the ground surface and ‘kill’ the well by pumping mud down the interception well (DOGGR, 1974).

 

Accumulation
of CO, in the
vadose zone and
soil gas

¢ Accumulations of gaseous CO, in groundwater can be removed or at least made immobile, by drilling wells that
intersect the accumulations and extracting the CO,. The extracted CO, could be vented to the atmosphere or reinject
back into a suitable storage site;

* Residual CO, that is trapped as an immobile gas phase can be removed by dissolving it in water and extracting it as
dissolved phase through groundwater extraction well;

¢ CO, that has dissolved in the shallow groundwater could be removed, if needed, by pumping to the surface and
aerating it to remove the CO,. The groundwater could then either be used directly or reinjected back into the
groundwate;

¢ If metals or other trace contaminants have been mobilized by acidification of the groundwater, ‘pump-and-treat’
methods can be used to remove them. Alternatively, hydraulic barriers can be created to immobilize and contain
the contaminants by appropriately placed injection and extraction wells. In addition to these active methods of
remediation, passive methods that rely on natural biogeochemical processes may also be used.

 

Leakage into the
vadose zone and
accumulation in
soil gas (Looney
and Falta, 2000)

 

* CO, can be extracted from the vadose zone and soil gas by standard vapor extraction techniques from horizontal or
vertical wells;

¢ Fluxes from the vadose zone to the ground surface could be decreased or stopped by caps or gas vapour barriers.
Pumping below the cap or vapour barrier could be used to deplete the accumulation of CO, in the vadose zone;

* Since CO, is a dense gas, it could be collected in subsurface trenches. Accumulated gas could be pumped from the
trenches and released to the atmosphere or reinjected back underground;

¢ Passive remediation techniques that rely only on diffusion and ‘barometric pumping’ could be used to slowly deplet«
one-time releases of CO, into the vadose zone. This method will not be effective for managing ongoing releases
because it is relatively slow;

¢ Acidification of the soils from contact with CO, could be remediated by irrigation and drainage. Alternatively,
agricultural supplements such as lime could be used to neutralize the soil;

 

Large releases
of CO, to the

¢ For releases inside a building or confined space, large fans could be used to rapidly dilute CO, to safe levels;
¢ For large releases spread out over a large area, dilution from natural atmospheric mixing (wind) will be the only

 

atmosphere practical method for diluting the CO,;

+ For ongoing leakage in established areas, risks of exposure to high concentrations of CO, in confined spaces (e.g.
cellar around a wellhead) or during periods of very low wind, fans could be used to keep the rate of air circulation
high enough to ensure adequate dilution.

Accumulation + Slow releases into structures can be eliminated by using techniques that have been developed for controlling release
of CO, in indoor of radon and volatile organic compounds into buildings. The two primary methods for managing indoor releases are
environments basement/substructure venting or pressurization. Both would have the effect of diluting the CO, before it enters the

level leakage

  

indoor environment (Gadgil et al., 1994; Fischer et al., 1996).

 

 

Accumulation in
surface water

 

¢ Shallow surface water bodies that have significant turnover (shallow lakes) or turbulence (streams) will quickly
release dissolved CO, back into the atmosphere;

¢ For deep, stably stratified lakes, active systems for venting gas accumulations have been developed and applied at
Lake Nyos and Monoun in Cameroon (http://perso.wanadoo.fr/mhalb/nyos/).

storage are permitted under the UNFCCC/KP, which allows

Presently, CO, is injected into the subsurface for EOR and
for disposal of acid gas (Section 5.2.4). Most of these recovery
or disposal activities inject relatively small quantities of CO,
into reasonably well-characterized formations. Generally, the
longevity of CO, storage underground and the extent of long-
term monitoring of the injected fluids are not specified in the
regulation of these activities, which are generally regulated
under the larger umbrella of upstream oil and gas production
and waste disposal regulations that do not specify storage time

The long-term storage of CO, amounts to ‘dumping’ under
the conventions (Purdy and Macrory, 2004); if CO, were to

not be considered dumping of waste and would be allowed
under the LC (Wall et al., 2005);

Onshore CO, geological storage would fall under provincial

Wells injecting hazardous wastes require the additional
development of a no-migration petition to be submitted to the
regulators. These petitions place the onus of proof on the project
proponent that injected fluid will not migrate from the disposal
site for 10,000 years or more. The fluids can exhibit buoyancy
effects, as disposed fluids can be less dense than the connate
fluids of the receiving formation. Operators are required to
use models to demonstrate they can satisfy the ‘no-migration’
requirement over 10,000 years. Wilson et al. (2003) suggests
that this process of proving containment could provide a model
for long-term storage of CO,. While detailed requirements exist
for siting, constructing and monitoring injection well operation,
there are no federal requirements for monitoring or verification
of the actual movement of fluids within the injection zone, nor
are there general requirements for monitoring in overlying zones
to detect leakage. However, there are requirements for ambient
monitoring in deep hazardous and industrial waste wells, with
the degree of rigour varying from state to state.

"Scale is also an important issue. Simulations have shown
that the areal extent of a plume of CO, injected from a 1 GW
coal-fired power plant over 30 years into a 100-m-thick zone
will be approximately 100 km? (Rutqvist and Tsang, 2002)
and may grow after injection ceases. The approach to dealing
with this issue will vary, depending on the legal framework for
ownership of subsurface pore space. In Europe, for example,
pore space is owned by the State and, therefore, utilization is
addressed in the licensing process. In the United States, on the
other hand, the determination of subsurface property rights on
non-federal lands will vary according to state jurisdiction. In
most jurisdictions, the surface owner is entitled to exclusive
possession of the space formerly occupied by the subsurface
minerals when the minerals are exhausted, that is, the ‘pore
space’. In other jurisdictions, however, no such precedent exists

of (1) the relatively technical and ‘remote’ nature of the issue,

"Acceptance of the three conditions does not imply support
for CO, capture and storage. The technology may still be rejected
by some as too ‘end of pipe’, treating the symptoms not the
cause, delaying the point at which the decision to move away
from the use of fossil fuels is taken, diverting attention from the
development of renewable energy options and holding potential
long-term risks that are too difficult to assess with certainty.
Conversely, there may be little realization of the practical
difficulties in meeting existing and future energy needs from
renewables. Acceptance of CO, capture and storage, where it
occurs, is frequently ‘reluctant’ rather than ‘enthusiastic’ and in
some cases reflects the perception that CO, capture and storage
might be required because of failure to reduce CO, emissions in
other ways. Furthermore, several of the studies above indicate
that an ‘in principle’ acceptance of the technology can be very

Focus-group research on CO, capture and storage was conducted
in the UK in 2001 and 2003 (Gough et al., 2002; Shackley et
al., 2004). Initial reactions tended to be sceptical; only within
the context of the broader discussion of climate change and the
need for large cuts in CO, emissions, did opinions become more
receptive. Typically, participants in these groups were clear that
other approaches such as energy efficiency, demand-reduction
measures and renewable energy should be pursued as a priority
and that CO, geological storage should be developed alongside
and not as a straight alternative to, these other options. There
was general support for use of CO, capture and storage as a
‘bridging measure’ while other zero or low carbon energy
technologies are developed or as an emergency stop-gap
option if such technologies are not developed in time. There
was a moderate level of scepticism among participants towards
both government and industry and what may motivate their
promotion of CO, storage, but there was also some distrust of
messages promoted by environmental groups. Levels of trust
in key institutions and the role of the media were perceived to
have a major influence on how CO, capture and storage would
be received by the public, a point also made by Huijts (2003).

"From this limited research, it appears that at least three
conditions may have to be met before CO, capture and storage
is considered by the public as a credible technology, alongside
other better known options: (1) anthropogenic global climate
change has to be regarded as a relatively serious problem; (2)
there must be acceptance of the need for large reductions in
CO, emissions to reduce the threat of global climate change;
(3) the public has to accept this technology as a non-harmful
and effective option that will contribute to the resolution of (1)
and (2). As noted above, many existing surveys have indicated
fairly widespread concern over the problem of global climate
change and a prevailing feeling that the negative impact
outweighs any positive effects (e.g., Kempton et al., 1995;
Poortinga and Pidgeon, 2003). On the other hand, some survey
and focus-group research suggests that widespread acceptance
of the above factors amongst the public — in particular the need
for large reduction in CO, emissions — is sporadic and variable
within and between national populations. Lack of knowledge
and uncertainty regarding the economic and environmental
characteristics of other principal mitigation options have also
been identified as an impediment to evaluating the CO, capture
and storage option (Curry et al., 2005).

Onshore storage costs depend on the location, terrain and

affect the number, spacing and cost of wells, as well as the

depth. Well costs depend on the specific technology, the location,

wells is a major component; however, the cost of individual
wells ranges from about US$ 200,000 for some onshore sites
(Bock et al., 2003) to US$ 25 million for offshore horizontal
wells (Table 5.10; Kaarstad, 2002). Increasing storage costs
with depth have been demonstrated (Hendriks et al., 2002). The
geological characteristics of the injection formation are another
major cost driver, that is, the reservoir thickness, permeability
and effective radius that affect the amount and rate of CO,
injection and therefore the number of wells needed. It is more
costly to inject and store other gases (NO,, SO, H,S) with CO,
because of their corrosive and hazardous nature, although the

enhanced oil, gas and coal bed methane options, additional
facilities may be required to handle produced oil and gas. Reuse

It has been shown that storage costs in disused oil and gas fields

by reusing existing wells in these fields, but remediation of

comprising a horizontal well to inject 1 MtCO, yr' was US$
15 million (Torp and Brown, 2005). Note that at Sleipner, CO,
had to be removed from the natural gas to ready it for sale on

at least in part driven by a 40 US$/tCO, tax on offshore CO,

America are well documented (Klins, 1984; Jarrell et al., 2002).
Carbon dioxide EOR projects are business ventures to increase
oil recovery. Although CO, is injected and stored, this is not
the primary driver and EOR projects are not optimized for CO,
storage.

CO,-enhanced gas recovery is a less mature technology than
EOR and it is not in commercial use. Issues are the cost of
CO, and infrastructure, concerns about excessive mixing and
the high primary recovery rates of many gas reservoirs. Cost
estimates show that CO,-EGR (enhanced gas recovery) can
provide a benefit of 4-16 US$/tCO,, depending on the price of
gas and the effectiveness of recovery (Oldenburg et al., 2002).

Experience from field operations across North America
provides information about how much of the injected CO,
remains in the oil reservoir during EOR. An average of 170
standard m* CO, of new CO, is required for each barrel of
enhanced oil production, with a range of 85 (0.15 tCO,) to 227
(0.4 tCO,) standard m? (Bock et al., 2003). Typically, produced
CO, is separated from the oil and reinjected back underground,
which reduces the cost of co purchases.

The commercial basis of conventional CO,-EOR operations
is that the revenues from incremental oil compensate for the
additional costs incurred (including purchase of CO,) and
provide a return on the investment. The costs differ from project
to project. The capital investment components are compressors,
separation equipment and H,S removal, well drilling and well
conversions and completions. New wells are not required for
some projects. Operating costs are the CO, purchase price, fuel

costs and field operating costs.

"5.9.4.2 Cost of CO, storage with enhanced oil recovery
Recent studies have estimated the cost of CO, storage in EOR
sites (Bock er al., 2003; Hendriks et al., 2002). Estimates of
CO, storage costs for onshore EOR options in North America
have been made by Bock et al. (2003). Estimates for a 2-MtCO,
yr storage scenario are based on assumptions and parameters
from existing EOR operations and industry cost data. These
include estimates of the effectiveness of CO,-EOR, in terms of
CO, injected for each additional barrel of oil. The methodology
for these estimates of storage costs is to calculate the break-
even CO, price (0.3 tCO,).

"The potential benefit of EOR can be deduced from the CO,
purchase price and the net storage costs for CO,-EOR storage
case studies. The indicative value of the potential benefit from
enhanced oil production to CO, storage is usually in the range
of 0-16 US$/tCO,. In some cases, there is no benefit from EOR.
The maximum estimate of the benefit ranges up to $92 per tonne
of CO, for a single case study involving favourable parameters.
In general, higher benefits will occur at high-oil-price scenarios
similar to those that have occurred since 2003 and for highly
favourable sites, as shown above. At 50 US$ per barrel of oil,
the range may increase up to 30 US$/tCO,.
"	Text
" 

At present, there are no > commercial offshore EOR
operations and limited information is available on CO, storage
costs for EOR options in offshore settings. Indicative storage
cost estimates for offshore EOR are presented by Hendriks
et al. (2002). Their range is —10.5 to +21.0 US$/CO, stored.
For the North Sea Forties Field, it has been shown that CO,-
flooding EOR is technically attractive and could increase oil
recovery, although at present it is not economically attractive as
a stand-alone EOR project (Espie et al., 2003). Impediments are
the large capital requirement for adapting facilities, wells and
flowlines, as well as tax costs and CO, supply. It is noted that
the economics will change with additional value for storage of
CO.

Well costs are a major factor in ECBM because many
wells are required. In one recent study for an ECBM project
(Schreurs, 2002), the cost per production well was given as
approximately US$750,000 per well, plus 1500 US$ m of in-
seam drilling. The cost of each injection well was approximately
US$430,000.

"Repeated use of seismic surveys was found to be an
effective monitoring technology at Sleipner. Its applicability
will vary between options and sites. Seismic survey costs are
highly variable, according to the technology used, location
and terrain and complexity. Seismic monitoring costs have
been reviewed for an onshore storage project for a 1000 MW
power plant with a 30-year life (Myer et al., 2003). Assuming
repeat surveys at five-year intervals during the injection period,
monitoring costs are estimated as 0.03 US$/tCO,, suggesting
that seismic monitoring may represent only a small fraction of
overall storage costs. No discounting was used to develop this
estimate.

Only one industrial-scale CO,-ECBM demonstration project

the Allison project, which has extremely favourable geological

be commercial, with high gas prices about 4 US$ per GJ) and

detailed modelling and economic analysis to show a break-even

"The IEA-GHG (1998) developed a global cost curve for CO,-
ECBM, with storage costs ranging from —20 to +150 US$/tCO,.
It concluded that only the most favourable sites, representing
less than 10% of global capacity, could have negative costs.
Estimates of onshore CO,-ECBM storage costs in the United
States have been made by using the approach described for
EOR (Bock et al., 2003). They estimate the effectiveness of
ECBM in terms of CO, injected for incremental gas produced,
ranging from 1.5 to 10 units (base case value of 2) of CO, per
unit of enhanced methane. Other key inputs are the gas well
production rate, the ratio of producers to injectors, well depth
and the number of wells. The base case, storing 2.1 MtCO, per
year for a representative reservoir at 610 m depth in a newly
built facility, requires 270 wells. The assumed gas price is
US$1.90 per GJ (US$2.00 per Mbtu). It has a net storage cost of
-8.1 US$/tCO, stored. Low- and high-cost cases representing
a range of parameters are —26.4 and +11.1 US$/tCO, stored.
The range of these estimates is comparable to other estimates
— for example, those for Canada (Wong et al., 2001) and Europe
(Hendriks et al., 2002), 0 to +31.5 US$/tCO,. Enhanced CBM

"Benson et al. (2005) have estimated life-cycle monitoring
costs for two scenarios: (1) storage in an oil field with EOR and
(2) storage in a saline formation. For these scenarios, no explicit
leakage was considered. If leakage were to occur, the ‘enhanced’
monitoring programme should be sufficient to detect and locate
the leakage and may be sufficient to quantify leakage rates as
well. For each scenario, cost estimates were developed for the
‘basic’ and ‘enhanced’ monitoring package. The basic monitoring
package included periodic seismic surveys, microseismicity,
wellhead pressure and injection-rate monitoring. The enhanced
package included all of the elements of the ‘basic’ package and
added periodic well logging, surface CO, flux monitoring and
other advanced technologies. For the basic monitoring package,
costs for both scenarios are 0.05 US$ACO,, based on a discount
rate of 10% (0.16-0.19 US$/tCO, undiscounted). The cost for
the enhanced monitoring package is 0.069-0.085 US$/tCO,
(0.27-0.30 US$/tCO, undiscounted). The assumed duration of
monitoring includes the 30-year period of injection, as well as
further monitoring after site closure of 20 years for EOR sites
and 50 years for saline formations. Increasing the duration of
monitoring to 1000 years increased the discounted cost by 10%.
These calculations are made assuming a discount rate of 10%
for the first 30 years and a discount rate of 1% thereafter.

1.

Current storage capacity estimates are imperfect:

¢ There is need for more development and agreement on
assessment methodologies.

¢ There are many gaps in capacity estimates at the global,
regional and local levels.

¢ The knowledge base for geological storage is for the most
part based on Australian, Japanese, North American and
west European data.

¢ There is a need to obtain much more information on
storage capacity in other areas, particularly in areas
likely to experience the greatest growth in energy use,
such as China, Southeast Asia, India, Russia/Former
Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and parts
of South America and southern Africa.

Overall, storage science is understood, but there is need for

greater knowledge of particular mechanisms, including:

¢ The kinetics of geochemical trapping and the long-term

impact of CO, on reservoir fluids and rocks.

¢ The fundamental processes of CO, adsorption and CH,
desorption on coal during storage operations.

 

Available information indicates that geological storage

operations can be conducted without presenting any greater

risks for health and the local environment than similar

operations in the oil and gas industry, when carried out

at high-quality and well-characterized sites. However,

confidence would be further enhanced by increased

knowledge and assessment ability, particularly regarding:

e Risks of leakage from abandoned wells caused by
material and cement degradation.

e The temporal variability and spatial distribution of leaks
that might arise from inadequate storage sites.

e Microbial impacts in the deep subsurface.

e Environmental impact of CO, on the marine seafloor.

e Methods to conduct end-to-end quantitative assessment
of risks to human health and the local environment.

"¢ Furtherknowledge of the history of natural accumulations

¢ Effective and demonstrated protocols for achieving
desirable storage duration and local safety.

. Monitoring technology is available for determining the

behaviour of CO, at the surface or in the subsurface;

however, there is scope for improvement in the following

areas:

* Quantification and resolution of location and forms of
CO, in the subsurface, by geophysical techniques.

¢ Detection and monitoring of subaquatic CO, seepage.

¢ Remote-sensing and cost-effective surface methods for
temporally variable leak detection and quantification,
especially for dispersed leaks.

¢ Fracture detection and characterization of leakage
potential.

¢ Development of appropriate long-term monitoring
approaches and strategies.

. Mitigation and remediation options and technologies are
available, but there is no track record of remediation for
leaked CO,. While this could be seen as positive, some
stakeholders suggest it might be valuable to have an
engineered (and controlled) leakage event that could be
used as a learning experience.

. The potential cost of geological storage is known reasonably

well, but:

¢ There are only a few experience-based cost data from
non-EOR CO, storage projects.

¢ There is little knowledge of regulatory compliance
costs.

¢ There is inadequate information on monitoring strategies
and requirements, which affect costs.

. The regulatory and responsibility or liability framework for

CO, storage is yet to be established or unclear. The following

issues need to be considered:

¢  Therole of pilot and demonstration projects in developing
regulations.

¢ Approaches for verification of CO, storage for accounting
purposes.

¢ Approaches to regulatory oversight for selecting,
operating and monitoring CO, storage sites, both in the
short and long term.

¢ Clarity on the need for and approaches to long-term
stewardship.

CO, lakes on the sea floor, and increasing CO, solubility by, for
example, dissolving mineral carbonates. Over centuries, ocean
mixing results in loss of isolation of injected CO, and exchange
with the atmosphere. This would be gradual from large regions
of the ocean. There are no known mechanisms for sudden or
catastrophic release of injected CO,,.

The increase in atmospheric CO, concentrations due to
anthropogenic emissions has resulted in the oceans taking
up CO, at a rate of about 7 GtCO,yr! (2 GtCyr'). Over the
past 200 years the oceans have taken up 500 GtCO, from the
atmosphere out of 1300 GtCO, total anthropogenic emissions.
Anthropogenic CO, resides primarily in the upper ocean and
has thus far resulted in a decrease of pH of about 0.1 at the
ocean surface with virtually no change in pH deep in the oceans.
Models predict that the oceans will take up most CO, released
to the atmosphere over several centuries as CO, is dissolved at

the ocean surface and mixed with deep ocean waters.

The Earth's oceans cover over 70% of the Earth's surface
with an average depth of about 3,800 metres; hence, there is
no practical physical limit to the amount of anthropogenic CO,
that could be placed in the ocean. However, the amount that
is stored in the ocean on the millennial time scale depends on
oceanic equilibration with the atmosphere. Over millennia,
CO, injected into the oceans at great depth will approach
approximately the same equilibrium as if it were released to the
atmosphere. Sustained atmospheric CO, concentrations in the
range of 350 to 1000 ppmv imply that 2,300 + 260 to 10,700
+ 1,000 Gt of anthropogenic CO, will eventually reside in the

Ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO, has led to a perturbation
of the chemical environment primarily i in ocean surface waters.
Increasing oceanCO, concentration leads to decreasing carbonate
ion concentration and increasing hydrogen ion activity (Box
6.1). The increase in atmospheric CO, from about 280 ppm in
1800 to 380 ppm in 2004 has caused an average decrease across
the surface of the oceans of about 0.1 pH units (ApH ~ —0.1)
from an initial average surface ocean pH of about 8.2. Further
increase in atmospheric CO, will result in a further change in
the chemistry of ocean surface waters that will eventually reach
the deep ocean (Figure 6.4). The anthropogenic perturbation of
ocean chemistry is greatest in the upper ocean where biological
activity is high.

The capacity of the oceans to absorb CO, in equilibrium
with the atmosphere is a function of the chemistry of sea water.
The rate at which this capacity can be brought into play is a
function of the rate of ocean mixing. Over time scales of decades
to centuries, exchange of dissolved inorganic carbon between
ocean surface waters and the deep ocean is the primary barrier
limiting the rate of ocean uptake of increased atmospheric CO,.
Over many centuries (Kheshgi, 2004a), changes in dissolved
inorganic carbon will mix throughout the ocean volume with
the oceans containing most of the cumulative CO, emissions
to the atmosphere/ocean system (Table 6.1; Figure 6.3). Over
longer times (millennia), dissolution of CaCO, causes an even
greater fraction of released CO, (85-92%) to reside in the ocean

CO, plume dynamics depend on the way in which CO, is
released into the ocean water column. CO, can be initially in the
form of a gas, liquid, solid or solid hydrate. All of these forms of
CO, would dissolve in sea water, given enough time (Box 6.1).
The dissolution rate of CO, in sea water is quite variable and
depends on the form (gas, liquid, solid, or hydrate), the depth
and temperature of disposal, and the local water velocities.
Higher flow rates increase the dissolution rate.

Gas. CO, could potentially be released as a gas above
roughly 500 m depth (Figure 6.8). Below this depth, pressures
are too great for CO, to exist as a gas. The gas bubbles would
be less dense than the surrounding sea water so tend to rise
towards the surface, dissolving at a radial speed of about 0.1
cm hr! (0.26 to 1.1 pmol cm s*; Teng et al., 1996). In waters
colder than about 9°C, a CO, hydrate film could form on the
bubble wall. CO, diffusers could produce gaseous CO, bubbles
that are small enough to dissolve completely before reaching

Depending on the details of the release and local sea floor
topography, the CO, stream could be engineered to dissolve in
the ocean or sink to form a lake on the sea floor. CO,, dissolved
in sea water at high concentrations can form a dense plume or
sinking current along an inclined sea floor. If release is at a great
enough depth, CO, liquid will sink and could accumulate on the
sea floor as a pool containing a mixture of liquid and hydrate.
In the short-term, fixed or towed pipes appear to be the most
viable methods for oceanic CO, release, relying on technology
that is already largely commercially available.

"6.2.1.3 Basic behaviour of CO, released in different forms
The near-field behaviour of CO, released into the ocean
depends on the physical properties of CO, (Box 6.2) and the
method for CO, release. Dissolved CO, increases the density
of sea water (e.g., Bradshaw, 1973; Song, et al., 2005) and this
affects transport and mixing. The near field may be defined
as that region in which it is important to take effects of CO,-
induced density changes on the fluid dynamics of the ocean into
consideration. The size of this region depends on the scale and
design of CO, release (Section 6.2.1.4).

"Liquid. Below roughly 500 m depth, CO, can exist in the
ocean as a liquid. Above roughly 2500 m depth CO, is less
dense than sea water, so liquid CO, released shallower than
2500 m would tend to rise towards the surface. Because most
ocean water in this depth range is colder than 9°C, CO, hydrate
would tend to form on the droplet wall. Under these conditions,
the radius of the droplet would diminish at a speed of about 0.5
cm hr! (= 3 ymol cm? s""'; Brewer et al., 2002). Under these
conditions a 0.9 cm diameter droplet would rise about 400 m in
an hour before dissolving completely; 90% of its mass would be
lost in the first 200 m (Brewer er al., 2002). Thus, CO, diffusers
could be designed to produce droplets that will dissolve within
roughly 100 m of the depth of release. If the droplet reached
approximately 500 m depth, it would become a gas bubble.

"Called Out,

An international consortium involving engineers,
oceanographers and ecologists from 15 institutions in the
United States, Norway, Japan and Canada proposed an in-situ
experiment to help evaluate the feasibility of ocean carbon
storage as a means of mitigating atmospheric increases. This
was to be a collaborative study of the physical, chemical, and
biological changes associated with direct injection of CO,
into the ocean (Adams er al., 2002). The proposed CO, Ocean
Sequestration Field Experiment was to inject less than 60
tonnes of pure liquid carbon dioxide (CO,) into the deep ocean
near Keahole Point on the Kona coast of the Island of Hawaii.
This would have been the largest intentional CO, release into
the ocean water column. The test was to have taken place in
water about 800 m deep, over a period of about two weeks
during the summer of 2001. Total project cost was to have
been roughly US$ 5 million. A small steel pipeline, about 4 cm
in diameter, was to have been deployed from a ship down to
the injection depth, with a short section of pipeline resting on
the sea floor to facilitate data collection. The liquid CO, was
to have been dispersed through a nozzle, with CO, droplets
briefly ascending from the injection point while dissolving into
the sea water. However, the project met with opposition from
environmental organizations and was never able to acquire
all of the necessary permits within the prescribed budget and
schedule (de Figueiredo, 2002).

At typical pressures and temperatures that exist in the ocean, pure CO, would be a gas above approximately 500 m and a
liquid below that depth. Between about 500 and 2700 m depth, liquid CO, is lighter than sea water. Deeper than 3000 m, CO, is
denser than sea water. The buoyancy of CO, released into the ocean determines whether released CO, rises or falls in the ocean
column (Figure 6.9). In the gas phase, CO, is lighter than sea water and rises. In the liquid phase co, is a highly compressible
fluid compared to sea water. A fully formed crystalline CO, hydrate is denser than sea water and will form a sinking mass (Aya
et al., 2003); hydrate formation can thus aid ocean CO, storage by more rapid transport to depth, and by slowing dissolution.
It may also create | a nuisance by impeding flow in pipelines or at injectors.

Hydrate. CO, hydrate is a form of CO, in which a cage of
water molecules surrounds each molecule of CO,. It can form in
average ocean waters below about 400 m depth. A fully formed
crystalline CO, hydrate is denser than sea water and will sink
(Aya et al., 2003). The surface of this mass would dissolve at
a speed similar to that of solid CO,, about 0.2 cm hr (0.47 to
0.60 wm s!; Rehder et al., 2004; Teng er al., 1999), and thus
droplets could be produced that either dissolve completely in
the sea water or sink to the sea floor. Pure CO, hydrate is a hard
crystalline solid and will not flow through a pipe; however a
paste-like composite of hydrate and sea water may be extruded
(Tsouris et al., 2004), and this will have a dissolution rate
intermediate between those of CO, droplets and a pure CO,
hydrate.

"6.2.1.5 Behaviour of injected CO, in the far field

The far field is defined as the region in which the concentration
of added CO, is low enough such that the resulting density
increase does not significantly affect transport, and thus CO,
may be considered a passive tracer in the ocean. Typically, this
would apply within a few kilometres of an injection point in
midwater, but if CO, is released at the sea floor and guided
along topography, concentration may remain high and influence
transport for several tens of kilometres. CO, is transported by
ocean currents and undergoes further mixing and dilution with
other water masses (Alendal and Drange, 2001). Most of this
mixing and transport occurs along surfaces of nearly constant
density, because buoyancy forces inhibit vertical mixing in a
stratified fluid. Over time, a release of CO, becomes increasingly
diluted but affects ever greater volumes of water.
"	Text
"The dynamics of CO,-rich plumes determine both the depth at
which the CO, leaves the near-field environment and the amount
of initial dilution (and consequently the amount of pH change).
When CO, is released in any form into seawater, the CO, can
move upward or downward depending on whether the co, is
less or more dense than the surrounding seawater. Drag forces
transfer momentum from the CO, droplets to the surrounding
water column producing motion in the adjacent water, initially
in the direction of droplet motion. Simultaneously, the CO,
dissolves into the surrounding water, making the surrounding
water denser and more likely to sink. As the CO,-enriched water
moves, it mixes with surrounding water that is less enriched in
CO,, leading to additional dilution and diminishing the density
contrast between the CO,-enriched water and the surrounding
water.

depressions, accumulating as a lake of CO, over which a thin
hydrate layer would form. This hydrate layer would retard
dissolution, but it would not insulate the lake from the overlying
water. The hydrate would dissolve into the overlying water (or
sink to the bottom of the CO, lake), but the hydrate layer would
be continuously renewed through the formation of new crystals
(Mori, 1998). Laboratory experiments (Aya ef al., 1995) and
small deep ocean experiments (Brewer et al., 1999) show that
deep-sea storage of CO, would lead to CO, hydrate formation

Carbonate minerals have been proposed as the primary source
of alkalinity for neutralization of CO, acidity (Kheshgi 1995;
Rau and Caldeira, 1999). There have been many experiments
and observations related to the kinetics of carbonate mineral
dissolution and precipitation, both in fresh water and in sea
water (Morse and Mackenzie, 1990; Morse and Arvidson, 2002).
Carbonate minerals and other alkaline compounds that dissolve
readily in surface sea water (such as Na,CO,), however, have
not been found in sufficient quantities to store carbon in the
ocean on scales comparable to fossil CO, emissions (Kheshgi,
1995). Carbonate minerals that are abundant do not dissolve
in surface ocean waters. Surface ocean waters are typically
oversaturated with respect to carbonate minerals (Broecker
and Peng, 1982; Emerson and Archer, 1990; Archer, 1996), but
carbonate minerals typically do not precipitate in sea water due
to kinetic inhibitions (Morse and Mackenzie, 1990).

"Over thousands of years, increased sea water acidity resulting
from CO, addition will be largely neutralized by the slow
natural dissolution of carbonate minerals in sea-floor sediments
and on land. This neutralization allows the ocean to absorb
more CO, from the atmosphere with less of a change in ocean
PH, carbonate ion concentration, and pCO, (Archer er al., 1997,
1998). Various approaches have been proposed to accelerate
carbonate neutralization, and thereby store CO, in the oceans
by promoting the dissolution of carbonate minerals”. These
approaches (e.g., Kheshgi, 1995; Rau and Caldeira, 1999) do not
entail initial separate CO, capture and transport steps. However,
no tests of these approaches have yet been performed at sea,
so inferences about enhanced ocean CO, storage, and effects
on ocean pH are based on laboratory experiments (Morse and
Mackenzie, 1990; Morse and Arvidson, 2002), calculations
(Kheshgi, 1995), and models (Caldeira and Rau, 2000).

To circumvent the problem of oversaturated surface waters,
Kheshgi (1995) considered promoting reaction (5) by calcining
limestone to form CaO, which is readily soluble. If the energy for
the calcining step was provided by a CO,-emission-free source,
and the CO, released from CaCO, were captured and stored
(e.g., ina geologic formation), then this process would store 1.8
mole CO, per mole CaO introduced into the ocean. If the CO,
from the calcining step were not stored, then a net 0.8 mole CO,
would be stored per mole CaO. However, if coal without CO,
capture were used to provide the energy for calcination, and
the CO, produced in calcining was not captured, only 0.4 mole
CO, would be stored net per mole lime (CaO) to the ocean,
assuming existing high-efficiency kilns (Kheshgi, 1995). This
approach would increase the ocean sink of CO,, and does not
need to be connected to a concentrated CO, source or require
transport to the deep sea. Such a process would, however, need
to avoid rapid re-precipitation of CaCO,, a critical issue yet to
be addressed.

lifetime of a co, lake would be longest in relatively confined
environments, such as might be found in some trenches or
depressions with restricted flow (Ohgaki and Akano, 1992).
Strong flows have been observed in trenches (Nakashiki,
1997). Nevertheless, simulation of CO, storage in a deep trench
(Kobayashi, 2003) indicates that the bottom topography can
weaken vertical momentum and mass transfer, slowing the CO,
dissolution rate. In a quiescent environment, transport would
be dominated by diffusion. Double-diffusion in the presence
of strong stratification may produce long lake lifetimes. In
contrast, the flow of sea water across the lake surface would
increase mass transfer and dissolution. For example, CO, lake
lifetimes of >10,000 yr for a 50 m thick lake can be estimated
from the dissolution rate of 0.44 cm yr"" for a quiescent, purely
diffusive system (Ohsumi, 1997). Fer and Haugan (2003) found
that a mean horizontal velocity of 0.05 m s would cause the

Furthermore, they found that an ocean bottom storm with a

Carbonate neutralization approaches require large amounts
of carbonate minerals. Sedimentary carbonates are abundant
with estimates of 5 x 10'7 tonnes (Berner ef al., 1983), roughly
10,000 times greater than the mass of fossil-fuel carbon.
Nevertheless, up to about 1.5 mole of carbonate mineral must
be dissolved for each mole of anthropogenic CO, permanently
stored in the ocean (Caldeira and Rau, 2000); therefore, the
mass of CaCO, used would be up to 3.5 times the mass of CO,
stored. Worldwide, 3 Gt CaCO, is mined annually (Kheshgi,
1995). Thus, large-scale deployment of carbonate neutralization
approaches would require greatly expanded mining and
transport of limestone and attendant environmental impacts. In
addition, impurities in dissolved carbonate minerals may cause
deleterious effects and have yet to be studied.

Process wastewater could be engineered t to contain different
ratios of added carbon and calcium, and different ratios of flue
gas CO, to dissolved limestone (Caldeira and Wickett, 2005).
Processes involving greater amounts of limestone dissolution
per mole CO, added lead to a greater CO, fraction being
retained. The effluent from a carbonate-dissolution reactor
could have the same pH, pCO,, or [CO,*] as ambient seawater,
although processing costs may be reduced by allowing effluent
composition to vary from these values (Caldeira and Rau, 2000).
Elevation in Ca and bicarbonate content from this approach
is anticipated to be small relative to the already existing
concentrations in sea water (Caldeira and Rau, 2000), but
effects of the new physicochemical equilibria on physiological
performance are unknown. Neutralization of carbon acidity

confirm inferences based on simpler models and considerations
of ocean chemistry and radiocarbon decay rates. In ocean
general circulation simulations performed by seven modelling
groups (Orr, 2004), CO, was injected for 100 years at each of
seven different locations and at three different depths. Model
results indicate that deeper injections will be isolated from the
atmosphere for longer durations. Figure 6.17 shows the effect
of injection depth on retained fraction for the mean of seven
ocean sites (Orr, 2004). Ranges of model results indicate some
uncertainty in forecasts of isolation of CO, released to the deep
ocean, although for all models the time extent of CO, isolation is
longer for deeper CO, release, and isolation is nearly complete
for 100 years following CO, release at 3000 m depth (Figure
6.18 and 6.19). However, present-day models disagree as to the
degassing time scale for particular locations (Figure 6.19). There
seems to be no simple and robust correlation of CO, retention
other than depth of injection (Caldeira et al., 2002), however,
there is some indication that the mean fraction retained for
stored carbon is greater in the Pacific Ocean than the Atlantic
Ocean, but not all models agree on this. Model results indicate
that for injection at 1500 m depth, the time scale of the partial
CO, degassing is sensitive to the location of the injection, but at
3000 m, results are relatively insensitive to injection location.

Fraction retained is used throughout this report to indicate
how long the CO, is stored. In addition the following measures can
be used to compare the effectiveness of ocean carbon storage with
other options, for example:

e The Net Present Value (NPV) approach (Herzog et al., 2003)
considers temporary storage to be equivalent to delayed emission
of CO, to the atmosphere. The value of delaying CO, emissions
depends on the future costs of CO, emission and economic discount
rates. There is economic value to temporary storage (i.e., delayed
emission) if the cost of CO, emissions increases at a rate that is less
than the discount rate (Herzog et al., 2003).

¢ The Global-Warming Potential (GWP) is a measure defined by
the IPCC to compare the climatic effect of different greenhouse-
gas emissions. It is computed by accumulating the radiative climate
forcing of a greenhouse-gas emission over a specified time horizon.
This measure has been applied to compare the radiative forcing
from oceanic and atmospheric releases of carbon dioxide (Kheshgi
et al., 1994, Ramaswamy et al., 2001). Haugan and Joos (2004)
propose a modification to the GWP approach that compares the
climate effects of the airborne fraction of a CO, release to the ocean
with those from a release to the atmosphere. Table 6.2 compares
these measures for results from a schematic model at three depths.

concurrent global warming due to weaker overturning and
a more stratified ocean (Jain and Cao, 2005). Some evidence

Increased CO, concentrations in the ocean promote dissolution
of CaCO, sediments, which would tend to increase predicted
CO, retention. This has been modelled for the deep sea with

"Dispersal of liquid CO, at a depth of 1000 m or deeper is

on the bottom of the sea in depths down to 1600 m, and design

transport 70,000 tCO, day’, enough for CO, captured from 3

Liro et al. (1992) proposed injecting liquid CO, at a depth of
about 1000 m from a manifold lying near the ocean bottom
to form a rising droplet plume. Nihous et al. (2002) proposed
injecting liquid CO, at a depth of below 3000 m from a manifold
lying near the ocean bottom and forming a sinking droplet
plume. Engineering work would need to be done to assure that,
below 500 m depth, hydrates do not form inside the discharged

pipe and nozzles, as this could block pipe or nozzle flow.

low O, and high CO, concentrations, known as the ‘oxygen minimum zone’. Bacteria are the primary consumers of organic

The numbers of organisms living on the sea floor p per unit area decreases exponentially with depth, probably associated
with the diminishing flux of food with depth. On the sea floor of the deepest ocean and of the upper ocean, the fauna can
be dominated by a few species. Between 2000 and 3000 m depth ecosystems tend to have high species diversity with a low
number of individuals, meaning that each species has a low population size (Snelgrove and Smith, 2002). The fauna living in
the water column appear to be less diverse than that on the sea floor, probably due to the relative uniformity of vast volumes

Deep-sea ecosystems generally depend on sinking particles of organic carbon made by photosynthesis near the ocean
surface settling down through the water. Most species living in the deep sea display very low metabolic rates (Childress, 1995),
especially in oxygen minimum layers (Seibel et al., 1997). Organisms living in the deep seawaters have adapted to the energy-
limited environment by conserving energy stores and minimizing energy turnover. As a result of energy limitations and cold
temperatures found in the deep sea, biological activities tend to be extremely low. For example, respiration rates of rat-tail fish
are roughly 0.1% that of their shallow-water relatives. Community respiration declines exponentially with depth along the
California margin, however, rapid turnover of large quantities of organic matter has been observed on the ocean floor (Mahaut
et al., 1995; Smith and Demopoulos, 2003). Thus, biological activity of some animals living on the deep sea floor can be as
great as is found in relatives living on the sea floor in shallow waters.

Deep-sea ecosystems may take a long time to recover from disturbances that reduce population size. Organisms have
adapted to the energy-limited environment of the deep sea by limiting investment in reproduction, thus most deep-sea species
produce few offspring. Deep-sea species tend to invest heavily in each of their eggs, making them large and rich in yolk to
provide the offspring with the resources they will need for survival. Due to their low metabolic rates, deep-sea species tend
to grow slowly and have much longer lifespans than their upper-ocean cousins. For example, on the deep-sea floor, a bivalve
less than 1 cm across can be more than 100 years old (Gage, 1991). This means that populations of deep-sea species will be
more greatly affected by the loss of individual larvae than would upper ocean species. Upon disturbance, recolonization and
community recovery in the deep ocean follows similar patterns to those in shallow waters, but on much longer time scales

(several years compared to weeks or months in shallow waters, Smith and Demopoulos, 2003).

At some locations near the sea floor, especially near submarine volcanic CO, sources, CO, concentrations can fluctuate
greatly. Near deep-sea hydrothermal vents CO, partial pressures (pCO,, expressed as a ppm fraction of atmospheric pressure,
equivalent to atm) of up to 80,000 ppm have been observed. These are more than 100 times the typical value for deep-
sea water. Typically, these vents are associated with fauna that have adapted to these conditions over evolutionary time.
For example, tube worms can make use of high CO, levels for chemosynthetic CO, fixation in association with symbiotic
bacteria (Childress er al., 1993). High CO, levels (up to a pCO, of 16,000 ppm; Knoll et al., 1996) have been observed in
ocean bottom waters and marine sediments where there are high rates organic matter oxidation and low rates of mixing with
the overlying seawater. Under these conditions, high CO, concentrations are often accompanied by low O, concentrations.
Near the surface at night, respiratory fluxes in some relatively confined rock pools of the intertidal zone can produce high CO,
levels. These patterns suggest that in some environments, organisms have evolved to tolerate relatively wide pH oscillations
and/or low pH values.

on elevated pCO,, which are now extinct. This limits the use of natural analogues or Earth history to predict and generalize
effects of CO, injection on most extant marine life.

Venting of carbon dioxide-rich fluids: Hydrothermal vents, often associated with mid-ocean-ridge systems, often release
CO, rich fluids into the ocean and can be used to study CO, behaviour and effects. For example, Sakai et al. (1990)
observed buoyant hydrate forming fluids containing 86-91% CO, (with H,S, and methane etc. making up the residual)
released from the sea floor at 1335-1550 m depth from a hydrothermal vent field. These fluids would be similar to a heavily
contaminated industrial CO, source. These fluids arise from the reaction of sea water with acid and intermediate volcanic
rocks at high temperature; they are released into sea water of 3.8°C. A buoyant hydrate-coated mass forms at the sea floor,
which then floats upwards dissolving into the ocean water. Sea floor venting of aqueous fluids, rich in CO, and low in pH
(3.54.4), is also to be found in some hydrothermal systems (Massoth et al., 1989; Karl, 1995).

Near volcanic vents, deep-sea ecosystems can be sustained by a geochemical input of chemical energy and CO,. While
there has been extensive investigation of these sites, and the plumes emanating from them, this has not yet been in the
context of analogues for industrial CO, storage effects. Such an investigation would show how a fauna has evolved to adapt
to a high-CO, environment; it would not show how biota adapted to normal ocean water would respond to increased CO,
concentrations.*

Deep saline brine pools: The ocean floor is known to have a large number of highly saline brine pools that are anoxic and
toxic to marine life. The salty brines freely dissolve, but mixing into the overlying ocean waters is impeded by the stable
stratification imparted by the high density of the dissolving brines. The Red Sea contains many such brine pools (Degens
and Ross, 1969; Anschutz er al., 1999), some up to 60 km? in area, filled with high-temperature hyper-saline, anoxic, brine.
Animals cannot survive in these conditions, and the heat and salt that are transported across the brine-seawater interface
form a plume into the surrounding bottom water. Hydrothermal sources resupply brine at the bottom of the brine pool
(Anschutz and Blanc, 1996). The Gulf of Mexico contains numerous brine pools. The largest known is the Orca Basin,
where a 90 km? brine pool in 2250 m water depth is fed by drainage from exposed salt deposits. The salt is toxic to life, but
biogeochemical cycles operate at the interface with the overlying ocean (van Cappellen et al., 1998). The Mediterranean
also contains numerous large hypersaline basins (MEDRIFF Consortium, 1995).

Taken together these naturally occurring brine pools provide examples of vast volumes of soluble, dense, fluids, hostile
to marine life, on the sea floor. The number, volume, and extent of these pools exceed those for scenarios for CO, lake
formation yet considered. There has been little study of the impact of the plumes emanating from these sources. These
could be examined to yield information that may be relevant to environmental impacts of a lake of CO, on the ocean
floor.
Changes over geological time: In certain times in Earth’s geological past the oceans may have contained more dissolved
inorganic carbon and/or have had a lower pH.

There is evidence of large-scale changes in calcifying organism distributions in the oceans in the geological record that
may be related in changes in carbonate mineral saturation states in the surface ocean. For example, Barker and Elderfield
(2002) demonstrated that glacial-interglacial changes in the shell weights of several species of planktonic foraminifera are
negatively correlated with atmospheric CO, concentrations, suggesting a causal relationship.

Cambrian CO, levels (i.e., about 500 million years ago) were as high as 5000 ppm and mean values decreased progressively
thereafter (see. Dudley, 1998; Berner, 2002). Two to three times higher than extant ocean calcium levels ensured that
calcification of, for example, coral reefs was enabled in paleo-oceans despite high CO, levels (Arp et al., 2001). High
performance animal life appeared in the sea only after atmospheric CO, began to diminish. The success of these creatures
may have depended on the reduction of atmospheric CO, levels (reviewed by Portner er al., 2004, 2005).

CO, is also thought to have been a potential key factor in the late Permian/Triassic mass extinction, which affected corals,
articulate brachiopods, bryozoans, and echinoderms to a larger extent than molluscs, arthropods and chordates (Knoll et al.,
1996; Berner, 2002; Bambach et al., 2002). Pértner et al. (2004) hypothesized that this may be due to the corrosive effect
of CO, on heavily calcified skeletons. CO, excursions would have occurred in the context of large climate oscillations.
Effects of temperature oscillations, hypoxia events and CO, excursions probably contributed to extinctions (Portner er al.,
INNS see section 67 3)

Species living in the open ocean are exposed to low and
relatively constant CO, levels, and thus may be sensitive to CO,
exposure. In contrast, species dwelling in marine sediments,
especially in the intertidal zone, are regularly exposed to CO,
fluctuations and thus may be better adapted to high and variable
CO, concentrations. Physiological mechanisms associated with
CO, adaptation have been studied mostly in these organisms.
They respond to elevated CO, concentrations by transiently
diminishing energy turnover. However, such responses are

reduced metabolism involves a reduction in physical activity,
growth, and reproduction. Overall, marine invertebrates appear
more sensitive than fish (Pértner et al., 2005).

Typically, tolerance limits to CO, have been characterized by
changes in ocean pH or pCO, (see Shirayama, 1995; Auerbach
et al., 1997). However, changes in molecular CO,, carbonate,
and bicarbonate concentrations in ambient water and body
fluids may each have specific effects on marine organisms
(Pértner and Reipschlager, 1996). In water breathers like fish
or invertebrates CO, entry causes immediate disturbances in
acid-base status, which need to be compensated for by ion
exchange mechanisms. The acute effect of CO, accumulation
is more severe than that of the reduction in pH or carbonate-
ion concentrations. For example, fish larvae are more sensitive
to low pH and high CO, than low pH and low CO, (achieved
by addition of HCI with pCO, levels kept low by aeration;
Ishimatsu et al., 2004).

On evolutionary time scales most extant animal life has
adapted to, on average, low ambient CO, levels. Accordingly,
extant animal life may rely on these low pCO, values and it
is unclear to what extent species would be able to adapt to
permanently elevated CO, levels. Exposure to high CO, levels
and extremely acidic water can cause acute mortality, but more
limited shifts in CO,, pH, and carbonate levels can be tolerated
at least temporarily. Studies of shallow water organisms have
identified a variety of physiological mechanisms by which
changes in the chemical environment can affect fauna. These
mechanisms should also apply to organisms living in the deep
ocean. However, knowing physiological mechanisms alone
does not enable full assessment of impacts at ecosystem levels.
Long-term effects, for intervals greater than the duration of
the reproduction cycle or the lifespan of an individual, may be
overlooked, yet may still drastically change an ecosystem.

In comparison to squid and other invertebrates, fish (teleosts)
appear to be less sensitive to added CO,, probably due to their
lower metabolic rate, presence of red blood cells (erythrocytes
containing haemoglobin) to carry oxygen, existence of a
venous oxygen reserve, tighter epithelia, and more efficient
acid-base regulation. Thus, adult teleosts (bony fish) exhibit a
larger degree of independence from ambient CO,. A number of
tested shallow-water fish have shown relatively high tolerance
to added CO,, with short-term lethal limits of adult fish at a
pCO, of about 50,000 to 70,000 ppm. European eels (Anguilla
anguilla) displayed exceptional tolerance of acute hypercapnia
up to 104,000 ppm (for review see Ishimatsu et al., 2004, Pértner
et al., 2004). The cause of death in fish involves a depression
of cardiac functions followed by a collapse of oxygen delivery
to tissues (Ishimatsu er al., 2004). With mean lethal CO, levels
of 13,000 to 28,000 ppm, juveniles are more sensitive to acute
CO, stress than adults. In all of these cases, the immediate cause
of death appears to be entry of CO, into the organism (and not
primarily some other pH-mediated effect).

"Among invertebrates, this type of CO, sensitivity may be
highest in highly complex, high performance organisms like
squid (reviewed by Portner et al., 2004). Blue-blooded squid
do not possess red blood cells (erythrocytes) to protect their
extracellular blood pigment (haemocyanin) from excessive
PH fluctuations. Acute CO, exposure causes acidification of
the blood, will hamper oxygen uptake and binding at the gills
and reduce the amount of oxygen carried in the blood, limiting
performance, and at high concentrations could cause death.
Less oxygen is bound to haemocyanin in squid than is bound to
haemoglobin in bony fish (teleosts). Jet-propulsion swimming
of squid demands a lot of oxygen. Oxygen supply is supported
by enhanced oxygen binding with rising blood pH (and reduced
binding of oxygen with falling pH — a large Bohr effect’).
Maximizing of oxygen transport in squid thus occurs by means
of extracellular pH oscillations between arterial and venous
blood. Therefore, finely controlled extracellular pH changes
are important for oxygen transport. At high CO, concentrations,
animals can asphyxiate because the blood cannot transport
enough oxygen to support metabolic functions. In the most
active open ocean squid (//lex illecebrosus), model calculations
predict acute lethal effects with a rise in pCO, by 6500 ppm and
a 0.25 unit drop in blood pH. However, acute CO, sensitivity
varies between squid species. The less active coastal squid
(Loligo pealei) is less sensitive to added CO,,.

gastropods. These findings indicate that previous atmospheric
CO, accumulation may already be affecting the growth of

in surface-ocean ecosystem structure. Due to atmospheric CO,
accumulation, global calcification rates could decrease by 50%
over the next century (Zondervan et al., 2001), and there could
be significant shifts in global biogeochemical cycles. Despite
the potential importance of biogeochemical feedback induced

growth was observed in juvenile white sturgeon (Crocker and

associated increase in oxygen consumption indicated a shift
in energy budget towards maintenance metabolism, which
occurred at the expense of growth. This effect was associated

Available knowledge of CO, effects and underlying

ecosystems will likely set in during long-term exposure to pCO,
of more than 400 to 500 ppm or associated moderate pH changes
(by about 0.1-0.3 units), primarily in marine invertebrates
(Portner et al. 2005) and, possibly, unicellular organisms. For
injection at a rate of 0.37 GtCO, yr! for 100 years (Figure

sensitive to extremes in CO,. CO, affects many physiological
mechanisms that are also affected by temperature and hypoxia

to differential sensitivities among and within organisms, a

existence of a well-defined threshold beyond which CO,

transient CO, fluctuations, but may not be able to settle and
thrive in areas where CO, levels remain permanently elevated.
At concentrations that do not cause acute mortality, limited
tolerance may include reduced capacities of higher functions,

"Overall, extrapolation from knowledge mostly available for
surface oceans indicates that acute CO, effects (e.g., narcosis,
mortality) will only occur in areas where pCO, plumes reach
significantly above 5000 ppm of atmospheric pressure (in
the most sensitive squid) or above 13,000 or 40,000 ppm for
juvenile or adult fish, respectively. Such effects are thus expected
at CO, increases with ApH < -1.0 for squid. According to the
example presented in Figure 6.12, a towed pipe could avoid pH
changes of this magnitude, however a fixed pipe without design
optimization would produce a volume of several km? with this
pH change for an injection rate of 100 kg s""'. Depending on the
scale of injection such immediate effects may thus be chosen
to be confined to a small region of the ocean (Figures 6.13 and

At the ecosystem level, few studies carried out in surface
oceans report that species may benefit under elevated CO,
levels. Riebesell (2004) summarized observations in surface
ocean mesocosms under glacial (190 ppm) and increased CO,
concentrations (790 ppm). High CO, concentrations caused
higher net community production of phytoplankton. Diatoms
dominated under glacial and elevated CO, conditions, whereas
Emiliania huxleyi dominated under present CO, conditions. This
example illustrates how species that are less sensitive to added
CO, could become dominant in a high CO, environment, in this
case due to stimulation of photosynthesis in resource limited
phytoplankton species (Riebesell 2004). These conclusions
have limited applicability to the deep sea, where animals and
bacteria dominate. In animals, most processes are expected to
be depressed by high CO, and low pH levels (Table 6.4).

A common contaminant in CO, streams is H,S. There are
very large sources of H,S naturally occurring in the ocean:
many marine sediments are anoxic and contain large quantities
of sulphides; some large ocean basins (the Black Sea, the
Cariaco Trench etc.) are anoxic and sulphidic. As a result ocean
ecosystems that have adapted to deal with sulphide and sulphur-
oxidizing bacteria are common throughout the worlds oceans.

Food chain length and composition may be reduced associated

Such a catastrophic degassing involves the conversion of dissolved CO, into the gas phase. In the gas phase, CO, is
ouoyant and rises rapidly, entraining the surrounding water into the rising plume. As the water rises, CO, bubbles form more

‘eadily. These processes can result in the rapid release of CO, that has accumulated in the lake over a prolonged period of

Bubbles of CO, gas can only form in sea water shallower than about 500 m when the partial pressure of CO, in sea water
exceeds the ambient total pressure. Most release schemes envision CO, release deeper than this. CO, released below 3000 m

comprising a total of 19 people. These focus groups also
preferred geological storage to ocean storage; this preference
appeared to be based, ‘not primarily upon concerns for the
deep-sea ecological environment’, but on ‘the lack of a visible

The resulting waters are too dilute in CO, to produce partial CO, pressures exceeding total ambient pressure, thus CO,

gas phase boundary, there is a possibility of a self-accelerating regime of fluid motion that could lead to rapid degassing at

McCullagh (1996) considered the international legal control
of ocean storage, and found that, whilst the UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) encourages the use
of the oceans as a reservoir for CO,, the UN Convention on the
Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is ambiguous in its application to
ocean storage. Whilst ocean storage will reduce CO, emissions
and combat climate change, to constitute an active use of sinks
and reservoirs as required by the UNFCCC, ocean storage
would need to be the most cost-effective mitigation option.
As for UNCLOS, it is unclear whether ocean storage will be
allowable in all areas of the ocean, but provisions on protecting
and preserving the marine environment will be applicable if CO,
is deemed to be ‘pollution’ under the Convention (which will be
so, as the large quantity of CO, introduced is likely to cause
harm to living marine resources). In fulfilling their obligation to
prevent, reduce and control pollution of the marine environment,

Churchill (1996) also focuses on UNCLOS in his assessment
of the international legal issues, and finds that the consent of
the coastal state would be required if ocean storage occurred
in that state’s territorial sea (up tol2 miles from the coast). In
that state’s Exclusive Economic Zone (up to 200 miles), the
storage of CO, via a vessel or platform (assuming it constituted
‘dumping’ under the Convention) would again require the
consent of that state. Its discretion is limited by its obligation
to have due regard to the rights and duties of other states in the
Exclusive Economic Zone under the Convention, by other treaty
obligations (London and OSPAR) and the Convention’s general
duty on parties not to cause damage by pollution to other states’
territories or areas beyond their national jurisdiction. He finds
that it is uncertain whether the definition of ‘dumping’ would
apply to use of a pipeline system from land for ocean storage,
but, in any event, concludes that the discharge of CO, from a
pipeline will, in many circumstances, constitute pollution and
thus require the coastal state to prevent, reduce and control
such pollution from land-based sources. But ocean storage by
a pipeline from land into the Exclusive Economic Zone will
not fall within the rights of a coastal or any other state and any
conflict between them will be resolved on the basis of equity
and in the light of all the relevant circumstances, taking into
account the respective importance of the interests involved to
the parties as well as to the international community as a whole.
He finds that coastal states do have the power to regulate and
control research in their Exclusive Economic Zones, although
such consent is not normally withheld except in some cases.

"- Research facilities: Research facilities where ocean storage
concepts (e.g., release of CO, from a fixed pipe or ship, or
carbonate-neutralization approaches) can be applied and their
effectiveness and impacts assessed in situ at small-scale on a
continuing basis for the purposes of both scientific research
and technology development.

" 

There are many trade-offs to be analyzed in the design of
an economically optimal carbonate-neutralization reactor along
the lines of that described by Rau and Caldeira (1999). Factors
to be considered in reactor design include water flow rate, gas
flow rate, particle size, pressure, temperature, hydrodynamic
conditions, purity of reactants, gas-water contact area, etc.
Consideration of these factors has led to preliminary cost
estimates for this concept, including capture, transport, and
energy penalties, of 10 to 110 US$/tCO, net stored (Rau and
Caldeira, 1999).

"The cost of a monitoring and verification program could involve
deploying and maintaining a large array of sensors in the ocean.
Technology exists to conduct such monitoring, but a significant
fraction of the instrument development and production is
limited to research level activities. No estimate of costs for
near-field monitoring for ocean storage have been published,
but the costs of limited near-field monitoring would be small
compared to the costs of ocean storage in cases of the scale
considered in 6.9.2 and 6.9.3. Far field monitoring can benefit
from international research programs that are developing global
monitoring networks.

"This Chapter describes two rather different options for carbon
dioxide (CO,) storage: (i) the fixation of CO, in the form of
inorganic carbonates, also known as ‘mineral carbonation’ or
‘mineral sequestration’, and (ii) the industrial utilization of

CO, as a technical fluid or as feedstock for carbon containing

"and recycled using external energy sources. The resulting
carbonated solids must be stored at an environmentally suitable
location. The technology is still in the development stage and
is not yet ready for implementation. The best case studied so
far is the wet carbonation of the natural silicate olivine, which
costs between 50 and 100 US$/tCO, stored and translates into
a 30-50% energy penalty on the original power plant. When
accounting for the 10-40% energy penalty in the capture plant
as well, a full CCS system with mineral carbonation would
need 60-180% more energy than a power plant with equivalent
output without CCS.

The industrial use of CO, (see Section 7.3) as a gas or a
liquid or as feedstock for the production of chemicals could
contribute to keeping captured CO, out of the atmosphere by
storing it in anthropogenic carbon products. Industrial uses
provide a carbon sink, as long as the pool size keeps growing
and the lifetime of the compounds produced is long. Neither
prerequisite is fulfilled in practice, since the scale of CO,
utilization is small compared to anthropogenic CO, emissions,
and the lifetime of the chemicals produced is too short with
respect to the scale of interest in CO, storage. Therefore, the
contribution of industrial uses of captured CO, to the mitigation
of climate change is expected to be small.
"	Text
" 

In the case of mineral carbonation (see Section 7.2), captured
CO, is reacted with metal-oxide bearing materials, thus forming
the corresponding carbonates and a solid byproduct, silica for
example. Natural silicate minerals can be used in artificial
processes that mimic natural weathering phenomena, but also
alkaline industrial wastes can be considered. The products of
mineral carbonation are naturally occurring stable solids that
would provide storage capacity on a geological time scale.
Moreover, magnesium and calcium silicate deposits are sufficient
to fix the CO, that could be produced from the combustion of all
fossil fuels resources. To fix a tonne of CO, requires about 1.6 to
3.7 tonnes of rock. From a thermodynamic viewpoint, inorganic
carbonates represent a lower energy state than CO,; hence the
carbonation reaction is exothermic and can theoretically yield
energy. However, the kinetics of natural mineral carbonation is
slow; hence all currently implemented processes require energy
intensive preparation of the solid reactants to achieve affordable
conversion rates and/or additives that must be regenerated

"Figure 7.1 Material and energy balances through the system boundaries for a power plant with CO, capture and storage through mineral
carbonation. The fossil fuel input provides energy both to the power plant that produces CO, and to the mineralization process (either directly or
indirectly via the power plant). The ‘other materials’ input serves all processes within the system boundaries and includes the metal oxide bearing
materials for mineralization. The ‘other emissions’ output is made up of the byproducts of the mineralization reaction - silica and possibly water
- as well as of non-reacted input materials.

"Mineral carbonation is based on the reaction of CO, with metal
oxide bearing materials to form insoluble carbonates, with
calcium and magnesium being the most attractive metals. In
nature such a reaction is called silicate weathering and takes
place on a geological time scale. It involves naturally occurring
silicates as the source of alkaline and alkaline-earth metals and
consumes atmospheric CO,. This chapter deals, however, with
so-called mineral carbonation, where high concentration CO,
from a capture step (see Chapter 3) is brought into contact with
metal oxide bearing materials with the purpose of fixing the
co, as carbonates (Seifritz, 1990; Dunsmore, 1992; Lackner
et al., 1995). Suitable materials may be abundant silicate rocks,
serpentine and olivine minerals for example, or on a smaller-
scale alkaline industrial residues, such as slag from steel
production or fly ash. In the case of silicate rocks, carbonation
can be carried out either ex-situ in a chemical processing plant
after mining and pretreating the silicates, or in-situ, by injecting
CO, in silicate-rich geological formations or in alkaline aquifers.
Industrial residues on the other hand can be carbonated in the
same plant where they are produced. It is worth noting that
products of in-situ mineral carbonation and geological storage
may be similar for the fraction of the CO, injected for geological

Interms of material and energy balances, mineral carbonation
can be schematized as illustrated in Figure 7.1, which applies
to a power plant with CO, capture and subsequent storage
through mineral carbonation. With respect to the same scheme
for a power plant with capture and either geological or ocean
storage (see Figure 1.4) two differences can be observed. First,
there is an additional material flux corresponding to the metal
oxide bearing materials; this is present as input and also as
output, in the form of carbonates, silica, non-reacted minerals
and for some input minerals product water. Secondly, for the
same usable energy output, the relative amounts of fossil fuels
as input and of energy rejected as lower grade heat are different.
In-situ carbonation is an operation similar to geological storage,
while ex-situ carbonation involves processing steps requiring
additional energy input that are difficult to compensate for
with the energy released by the carbonation reaction. Given
the similarities of in-situ carbonation with geological storage,
this chapter will focus on ex-sifu mineral carbonation. With
present technology there is always a net demand for high grade
energy to drive the mineral carbonation process that is needed
for: (i) the preparation of the solid reactants, including mining,
transport, grinding and activation when necessary; (ii) the
processing, including the equivalent energy associated with the
use, recycling and possible losses of additives and catalysts;
(ili) the disposal of carbonates and byproducts. The relative
importance of the three items differs depending on the source of
the metal oxides, for example whether they are natural silicates
or industrial wastes.

"Since the reaction releases heat, the formation of carbonates
is thermodynamically favoured at low temperature, whereas
at high temperature (above 900°C for calcium carbonate and

The representative member of the olivine family considered in
the first reaction above is forsterite, which is iron-free. In nature
most olivines contain some iron that can form iron oxides or

On a smaller-scale, industrial wastes and mining tailings
provide sources of alkalinity that are readily available and
reactive. Even though their total amounts are too small to
substantially reduce CO, emissions, they could help introduce the
technology. Waste streams of calcium silicate materials that have
been considered for mineral carbonation include pulverized fuel
ash from coal fired power plants (with a calcium oxide content
up to 65% by weight), bottom ash (about 20% by weight CaO)
and fly ash (about 35% by weight CaO) from municipal solid
waste incinerators, de-inking ash from paper recycling (about
35% by weight CaO), stainless steel slag (about 65% by weight

Mining serpentine would not differ substantially from
conventional mining of other minerals with similar properties,
for example copper ores. Serpentine and olivine are both mined
already, although rarely on the scale envisioned here (Goff and
Lackner, 1998; Goff et al., 2000). Like in other mining operations,
disposal of tailings and mine reclamation are important issues to
consider. Tailing disposal depends on the material characteristics
— particle size and cohesion, moisture content and chemical
stability against natural leaching processes — and these depend
in turn on the specific process. It is likely that carbonation plants
will be located near the metal oxide bearing material, either the
factory producing the residues to be treated or the silicate mine,
to avoid transport of solid materials (see Figure 7.2).

Among silicate rocks, mafic and ultramafic rocks are rocks
that contain high amounts of magnesium, calcium and iron and
have a low content of sodium and potassium. Some of their main
mineral constituents are olivines, serpentine, enstatite (MgSiO,),
talc (Mg,Si,O,,(OH),) and wollastonite. Although molar
abundances of magnesium and calcium silicates in the Earth’s
crust are similar, rocks containing magnesium silicate exhibit a
higher MgO concentration (up to 50% by weight, corresponding
to a theoretical CO, storage capacity of 0.55 kg CO,/kg rock),
than rocks containing calcium silicates, for example basalts, that
have CaO content of about 10% by weight only (with a theoretical
CO, storage capacity of 0.08 kg CO,/kg rock) (Goff and Lackner,
1998). Deposits of wollastonite, the most calcium-rich silicate,
are much rarer than those of magnesium- rich silicates.

Economies of scale applying to today’s mining technology
suggest a minimum mining operation of 50,000 to 100,000
tonnes day (Hartman, 1992), which translates into a minimum
mineable volume of about 0.3 km’ for a mine with a 30 year life.
This is a rather small size for ophiolite ore bodies, which are
often kilometres wide and hundreds of meters thick (Goff and
Lackner, 1998; Goff et al., 2000; Newall et al., 2000). Since coal,
in contrast to ophiolite bodies, occurs in thin seams and is buried
under substantial overburden, it has been argued that a typical
above ground coal mine must move more material (Lackner
et al., 1995) and disturb a far larger area (Ziock and Lackner,
2000) for the same amount of carbon atoms treated than the
equivalent ophiolite mine, assuming maximum conversion of the
mineral to carbonate (one carbon atom yields one CO, molecule
upon combustion, which has to be fixed in one molecule of
carbonate).

that they have R,,, values between 1.97 and 2.51, depending on
purity and type (the R_,,, is the ratio of the mass of mineral needed

the CO, from all worldwide coal resources estimated at 10,000

The simplest approach to mineral carbonation would be
the reaction of gaseous CO, with particulate metal oxide
bearing material at suitable temperature and pressure levels.
Unfortunately, such direct gas-solid reactions are too slow to
be practical in the case of the materials mentioned in Section
7.2.3 (Newall et al., 2000) and are only feasible at reasonable
pressures for refined, rare materials like the oxides or hydroxides
of calcium and magnesium (Butt and Lackner, 1997; Bearat et

mineral carbonation without refined materials cannot directly

Since the direct fixation of carbon dioxide c on solid unrefined
material particles seems at present not feasible, the alternative
requires the extraction of the metal from the solid. This can be
accomplished by suspending the solid material in an aqueous
solution and by letting it dissolve and release metal ions, for
example calcium or magnesium ions. These ions come in contact
with carbonic acid (H,CO,) that is formed in the same solution
upon carbon dioxide dissolution. Conditions can be achieved
where the carbonate and the byproducts — silica in the case of
silicate carbonation for example — precipitate. This involves
proper choice of the operating parameters of this single-step or
multi-step process — particularly temperature, concentration of
possible additives and CO, pressure (that controls the carbonic
acid concentration in solution). At the end of the operation a

Mineral carbonation requires little CO, pre-processing. If CO,
is pipelined to the disposal site, the constraints on pipeline
operations are likely to exceed pre-processing needs for mineral
carbonation. The current state of research suggests that CO,
should be used at a pressure similar to the pipeline pressure,
thus requiring minimal or no compression (Lackner, 2002;
O’Connor et al., 2002). Purity demands in carbonation are
minimal; acidic components of the flue gas could pass through
the same process as they would also be neutralized by the base
and could probably be disposed of in a similar manner. Most
carbonation processes would preheat CO, typically to between
100°C and 150°C for aqueous processes, whereas in gas-solid
reactions temperatures could reach 300°C to 500°C (Butt et al.,
1996).

"Mineral carbonation starting from natural silicates is a
slow process that can be kinetically enhanced by raising the
temperature, although thermodynamics are a limiting factor. In
aqueous systems, this is typically kept below 200°C, since high
temperature favours gaseous CO, over precipitated carbonates.
It is believed that the metal oxide dissolution constitutes the
rate-limiting step and most research efforts have been devoted
to finding ways to speed up the metal extraction from the solid
input materials. This could be achieved either by activating the
mineral to make it more labile and reactive, or by enhancing
the metal oxide extraction through the presence of additives
or catalysts in solution. Activation can take different forms,
namely heat-treatment at 650°C for serpentine (Barnes ef al.,
1950; Dragulescu et al., 1972; O’Connor et al., 2000) and ultra-
fine (attrition) grinding for olivine and wollastonite (O’Connor
et al., 2002; Kim and Chung, 2002). The energy cost of
activation has been estimated to be of 300 kWh t'! of mineral
and 70-150 kWh t' of mineral for thermal and mechanical
activation, respectively (O’Connor et al., 2005). Carbonation
has been successfully performed after such pretreatment,
but it is so expensive and energy-intensive that its feasibility
is questionable (see Box 7.1 and O’Connor ef al., 2005).
Dissolution catalysts that can be added to the aqueous solution
include strong and weak acids (Pundsack, 1967; Lackner et al.,
1995; Fouda er al., 1996; Park et al., 2003; Maroto-Valer et
al., 2005), bases (Blencoe et al., 2003) and chelating agents
to extract SiO, or MgO groups from the mineral (Park et al.,
2003). All three approaches have been studied and at least
partially experimentally tested, but in all cases catalyst recovery
represents the key hurdle. It is worth noting that the carbonation
of metal oxides from industrial wastes can be faster than that of
natural silicates (Johnson, 2000; Fernandez Bertos er al., 2004;
Huijgen et al., 2004; lizuka et al., 2004; Stolaroff et al., 2005).

experimental tests and looks not only at the fundamental and technical aspects of the process, but also at the matching of
carbon dioxide sources and potential sinks that in this case are natural silicate deposits. In particular, seven large ultramafic
ores in the USA have been considered (two olivines, four serpentines (three lizardites and one antigorite) and one wollastonite).
Three are located on the west coast, three on the east coast and one in Texas. The selection of the seven ores has also been based
on considerations of regional coal consumption and potential CO, availability.

"Process costs have been calculated for these seven ores in the case of both standard mineral pretreatment and activated process.
Costs include only storage, thus neither CO, capture nor CO, transport and are based on the assumption that CO, is received
pure at 15 MPaat the plant. Investment costs are calculated accounting for the different reactor costs depending on the different
operating conditions corresponding to the different mineral ores. Storage costs are calculated per tonne of silicate ore and per
tonne of CO, stored and are complemented by the energy consumption per tonne of CO, stored in the above Table. The table
highlights a trade-off between energy input associated with the pretreatment procedure and cost per unit carbon dioxide stored.
Assuming that the cheapest technology is used for each mineral, costs range from 55 US$/tCO, stored for olivine (standard
pretreatment), to 64 US$/tCO, stored for wollastonite (activated), to 78 US$/tCO, stored for antigorite (activated), to 210

The three different minerals exhibit different reactivity, measured as the extent of the carbonation reaction after one hour
under specified operating conditions. A trade-off has been observed between the extent of reaction and mineral pretreatment,
thus higher reactivity is obtained for more intense pretreatment, which represents an energy cost. Mechanical activation is
effective for the olivine and the wollastonite and involves the use of both conventional rod and ball milling techniques with
an energy consumption of up to about 100 kWh t'! mineral (standard pretreatment) and ultra-fine grinding for up to more than
200 kWh t! mineral (activated process). Conversion is no more than 60% in the former case and up to above 80% in the latter.
In the case of the serpentine, after milling (standard pretreatment), thermal activation at 630°C is effective for the antigorite
(up to 92% conversion) but only partially for the lizardite (maximum conversion not larger than 40%) and requires an energy
consumption of about 350 kWh t! mineral. Optimal operating conditions for this wet process are mineral dependent and

The fine grinding of the mineral ore might allow for the
extraction of valuable mineral constituents. Serpentine and
olivine mines could provide iron ore that either would be
removed as magnetite by magnetic separation or result from
chemical precipitation during magnesium extraction, yielding
concentrated iron oxide or hydroxide (Park and Fan, 2004).
Peridotite rocks may contain chromite, elements like nickel and
manganese and also elements in the platinum group, but how
these can be recovered has still to be studied (Goff and Lackner,
1998). It has been suggested, that magnesium carbonate and
silica may find uses as soil enhancers, roadfill or filler for
mining operations. Eventually mineral carbonation would have
to operate at scales that would saturate any product or byproduct
market, but products and byproducts, when usable, could help
make a demonstration of the process more viable (Lackner et

that the molecular mass of carbon dioxide is 44.0 g mol"", of

and of olivine is 140.7 g mol"". For the sake of simplicity only
two assumptions are made, namely the degree of conversion
in the carbonation reactor — the fraction of olivine fed to the
reactor that is converted to carbonate in a single pass — and
the fraction of non-reacted mineral in the classifier that is not
recycled, but ends up with the material for disposal. Based on
the stoichiometry of the carbonation reaction, 1.6 tonnes of
olivine would be needed to fix one tonne of CO,, thus producing
2.6 tonnes of solid material for disposal. Assuming 90%
carbonation conversion and 10% losses in the classifier, 1.62
tonnes of olivine would be needed and 2.62 tonnes of solids
per tonne of CO, mineralized would be for disposal. Assuming
only 50% conversion and 20% losses, for one tonne of CO,
stored, 1.87 tonnes of olivine would be needed and 2.87 tonnes

reactor would be twice as big as in the former case.

"7.2.4.5. Aworked out example: single-step carbonation
Figure 7.3 illustrates the single step wet mineral carbonation
process that can be applied to natural silicates as well as
to industrial residues, for example steel slag (Huijgen et al.,
2004). The figure refers to the carbonation of olivine, whereby
the mineral is ground first. Subsequently it is dissolved in an
aqueous solution of sodium chloride (NaCl, | mol L~') and
sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO,, 0.64 mol L“') in contact with high
pressure CO, and carbonated therein (O’Connor et al., 2002;
O’Connor et al., 2005). The additives are easily recovered upon
filtration of the solid particles, since the sodium and chloride
ions do not participate in the reaction and remain in solution,
whereas the bicarbonate ion is replenished by contacting the
solution in the carbonation reactor with the CO, atmosphere.
A maximum conversion of 81% in one hour was obtained with
an olivine of 37 ym particle size, at a temperature of 185°C
and a CO, partial pressure of 15 MPa. An important element of
the process scheme in Figure 7.3 is the classification (sieving)
that allows separating the carbonate and silica products from
the olivine that has to be recycled. This is possible since non-
reacted olivine minerals are coarse, whereas the carbonate and
silica consist of finer particles (O’Connor ef al., 2002). An
additional difficulty of single-step carbonation is when, upon
extraction of the metal oxide from the solid particles, a silica
layer forms or a carbonate layer precipitates on the particles
themselves, thus hindering further dissolution. Experimental
evidence indicates that this does not occur in the case of olivine
(O’Connor ef al., 2002), whereas it does occur in the case of
steel slag (Huijgen et al., 2004).

Land clearing: The amount of material required to store
CO, involves extensive land clearing and the subsequent
displacement of millions of tonnes of earth, rock and soil,
increasing the potential for erosion, sedimentation and habitat
loss in the area. Access roads would also lead to clearing of
vegetation and soil. Standard practices recommended to
minimize these impacts include storage of topsoil removed for
use in future reclamation activities, use of existing tracks when
constructing access roads and pipelines and use of drainage and
sediment collection systems to catch runoff or divert surface
water, minimizing erosion.

— about 1.6 to 3.7 tonnes of silicate and 2.6 to 4.7 tonnes of
disposable materials per tonne of CO, fixed in carbonates, as
reported in Section 7.2.4 — this is of course a major operation.
When considering that one tonne of carbon dioxide corresponds
to 0.27 tonnes of carbon only in theory, but in practice to about
2 tonnes of raw mineral due to the overburden, it follows that
mineral carbonation to store the CO, produced by burning
coal would require the installation of a mining industry of a
scale comparable to the coal industry itself. Such large mining
operations are significant, but placing them in the context of the
operations needed for the use of fossil fuels and geological or

Air quality: Mining activities like blasting, drilling, earth
moving and grading can generate dust and fine particulate
matter that affect visibility and respiration and pollute local
streams and vegetation. Dust prevention measures are widely
applied at mining operations today, but if not properly
controlled, dust can threaten human respiratory health. This is
particularly important in serpentine mining because serpentine
often contains chrysotile, a natural form of asbestos. Even
though chrysotile is not as hazardous as amphibole asbestos
(tremolite, actinolite) (Hume and Rimstidt, 1992), the presence
of chrysotile requires covering of exposed veins and monitoring
of air quality (Nichols, 2000). On the other hand, mineral
carbonation products are asbestos free, as the reaction destroys
chrysotile, which reacts faster than other serpentines, even
if conversion of the starting material is not complete. This
makes mineral carbonation a potentially effective method for
the remediation of asbestos in serpentine tailing (O’Connor
et al., 2000). The resulting mineral carbonates are inert, but
large volumes of powders would also have to be controlled, for
example by cementing them together to avoid contamination of
soil and vegetation, as well as habitat destruction.

Public acceptance of mineral carbonation is contingent on the

by the fact that this method of storage is highly verifiable
and unquestionably permanent. On the downside, mineral
carbonation involves large-scale mining and associated

Once the carbon has been stored through mineral carbonation,
there are virtually no emissions of CO, due to leakage. To the
extent that weathering at the disposal ‘site occurs and leaches
out magnesium carbonate from the carbonation products,
additional CO, would be bound in the transformation of solid
magnesium carbonate to dissolved magnesium bicarbonate
(Lackner, 2002). It can therefore be concluded that the fraction

the fraction of the natural reserves of silicates, which greatly
exceed the needs, that can be effectively exploited for mineral
carbonation. This will require thorough study, mapping the
resources and matching sources and sinks, as in O’Connor et al.

influenced by the legal and societal constraints at a specific

"As an alternative to storing captured CO, in geological
formations (see Chapter 5), in the oceans (see Chapter 6), or in
mineral form as carbonates (see Section 7.2), this section of the
report assesses the potential for reducing net CO, emissions to
the atmosphere by using CO, either directly or as a feedstock
in chemical processes that produce valuable carbon containing
products. The utilization of CO, establishes an inventory of
stored CO,, the so-called carbon chemical pool, primarily
in the form of carbon-containing fuels, chemicals and other
products (Xiaoding and Moulijn, 1996). The production and
use of these products involve a variety of different ‘life cycles’
(i.e., the chain of processes required to manufacture a product
from raw materials, to use the product for its intended purpose
and ultimately to dispose of it or to reuse it in some fashion).
Depending on the product life-cycle, CO, is stored for varying
periods of time and in varying amounts. As long as the recycled
carbon remains in use, this carbon pool successfully stores
carbon. Withdrawal from this pool, by decay or by disposal
typically re-injects this carbon into the atmospheric pool.

overall cost of 27 US$/tCO, avoided has been reported, but the
assumptions are based on a rather limited set of experimental
data (Kakizawa et al., 2001). A comprehensive energy and
economic evaluation of the single step wet carbonation process
illustrated in Figure 7.3 has been recently reported (O’Connor

calculates storage costs between 50 and 100 US$/tCO, stored,
with between 30% and 50% of the energy produced needed
as input to the mineral carbonation step, i.e. a corresponding
reduction of power plant efficiency from 35% for instance to
25% and 18%, respectively. This implies that a full CCS system
with mineral carbonation would need 60-180% more energy
than a power plant with equivalent output without CCS, when
the 10-40% energy penalty in the capture plant is accounted
too. No similar economic evaluation is available for either dry
mineral carbonation or carbonation using industrial residues.
However, it is worth pointing out that the carbonation of toxic
wastes may lead to stabilized materials with reduced leaching
of heavy metals. Therefore these materials might be disposed of
more easily or even used for applications such as in construction
work (see Figure 7.2) (Venhuis and Reardon, 2001; Meima et

Once the overall system has been defined and analyzed in

as the difference in net emissions associated with the production
of a desired product. In general, the difference could be either
positive or negative, thus meaning that utilization of CO, could
result in either a decrease or increase in net CO, emissions,
depending on the details of the processes being compared. Note
that only fossil fuels as a primary energy source are considered
in this framework. Renewable energy sources and nuclear
power are specifically excluded, as their availability would
have implications well beyond the analysis of CO, utilization
options (see Chapter 8 for further discussion). Note too that
other emissions from the process may include toxic or harmful
materials, whose flows also could be either reduced or increased

will be available (Eliasson, 1994). Alternatively, it might be
possible to create a closed cycle with CO, being retrieved from

Liquid carbon-based fuels, gasoline and methanol for
example, are attractive because of their high energy density
and convenience of use, which is founded in part on a well-
established infrastructure. Carbon dioxide could become the
raw material for producing carbon-based fuels with the help
of additional energy. Since energy is conserved, this cannot
provide a net reduction in carbon dioxide emissions as long as
the underlying energy source is fossil carbon. If a unit of energy
from a primary resource produces a certain amount of CO,,
then producing a fuel from CO, will recycle CO, but release
an equivalent amount of CO, to provide the necessary energy
for the conversion. Since all these conversion processes involve
energy losses, the total CO, generated during fuel synthesis
tends to exceed the CO, converted, which once used up, is also

emitted.

Biomass production of fuels also falls into the category of
generating fuels from CO,. With the help of photosynthesis,
solar energy can convert water and CO, into energetic organic
compounds like starch. These in turn can be converted into
industrial fuels like methane, methanol, hydrogen or bio-
diesel (Larson, 1993). Biomass can be produced in natural or
agricultural settings, or in industrial settings, where elevated
concentrations of CO, from the off-gas of a power plant would
feed micro-algae designed to convert CO, into useful chemicals
(Benemann, 1997). Since biological processes collect their
own CO,, they actually perform CO, capture (Dyson, 1976).
If the biomass is put to good use, they also recycle carbon by
returning it to its energetic state. Biomass production eliminates
the need for fossil fuels, because it creates a new generation of
biomass-based carbonaceous fuels. As a replacement for fossil
energy it is outside the scope of this report. As a CO, capture
technology, biomass production is ultimately limited by the
efficiency of converting light into chemically stored energy.
Currently solar energy conversion efficiencies in agricultural
biomass production are typically below 1% (300 GJ ha""! yr"" or
1 W m°? (Larson, 1993)). Micro-algae production is operating
at slightly higher rates of 1 to 2% derived by converting photon
utilization efficiency into a ratio of chemical energy per unit
of solar energy (Melis et al., 1998; Richmond and Zou, 1999).
Hence the solar energy collection required for micro-algae to
capture a power plant’s CO, output is about one hundred times
larger than the power plant’s electricity output. At an average
of 200 W m* solar irradiation, a 100 MW power plant would
require a solar collection area in the order of 50 km’.

containing chemical products produced; there is CO, emission reduction in a certain time only if the pool has grown during
that time. With increasing production, such impact can be positive or negative, as shown above. It is clear that since this would

not correspond to the size of the pool, but to its size variation
on a yearly basis, or in general on its rate of change that might
be positive (increase of carbon storage and reduction of CO,
emissions) or negative (decrease of carbon storage and increase
of CO, emissions) depending on the evolution of the markets and
of the distribution systems (see also Box 7.2 for a quantitative
example). Data on the amount of carbon stored as inventory of
these materials in the supply chain and on the rate of change of
this amount is not available, but the figures in Table 7.2 and the
analysis above indicate that the quantity of captured carbon that
could be stored is very small compared with total anthropogenic
carbon emissions. Thus, the use of captured CO, in industrial
processes could have only a minute (if any) effect on reduction
of net CO, emissions.

"fossil fuel in a chemical process, for example a hydrocarbon,
with captured CO, is sometimes possible, but does not affect
the overall carbon budget, thus CO, does not replace the fossil
fuel feedstock. The hydrocarbon has in fact two functions — it
provides energy and it provides carbon as a building block. The
CO, fails to provide energy, since it is at a lower energy level than
the hydrocarbon (see Box 7.3). The energy of the hydrocarbon
is often needed in the chemical process and, as in the production
of most plastics, it is embodied in the end product. Alternatively,
the energy of the hydrocarbon is available and likely to be
utilized in other parts of the process, purification, pretreatment
for example, or in other processes within the same plant. If this
energy is missing, since CO, is used as carbon source, it has to
be replaced somehow to close the energy balance of the plant.
As long as the replacement energy is provided from fossil fuels,
net CO, emissions will remain unchanged. It is worth noting
that an economy with large non-fossil energy resources could
consider CO, feedstocks to replace hydrocarbons in chemical
synthesis. Such approaches are not covered here, since they
are specific examples of converting to non-fossil energy and as
such are driven by the merits of the new energy source rather
than by the need for capture and storage of CO,.

Therefore, in terms of energy there is no benefit in choosing path (8) rather than path (7). In terms of efficiency of the
whole chemical process there might be a potential improvement, but there might also be a potential disadvantage, since route
(7) integrates the heat generation associated with the oxidation of carbon and the conversion to product A. These effects are
of second order importance and have to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Nevertheless, the scale of the reduction in CO,
emissions would be rather small, since it would be even smaller than the scale of the production of the chemicals that might be
impacted by the technology change, that is by the change from path (7) to path (8) (Audus and Oonk, 1997).

cases is that in case (8) this overall energy change is split into two parts - AH=AH,,, +AH, , — one for combustion in the power

"The major components of a carbon dioxide capture and storage

transport, and storage (including measurement, monitoring

little commercial experience with configuring all of these
components into fully integrated CCS systems at the kinds of
scales which would likely characterize their future deployment.
The literature reports a fairly wide range of costs for employing
CCS systems with fossil-fired power production and various
industrial processes. The range spanned by these cost estimates
is driven primarily by site-specific considerations such as the
technology characteristics of the power plant or industrial
facility, the specific characteristics of the storage site, and the
required transportation distance of carbon dioxide (CO,). In
addition, estimates of the future performance of components
of the capture, transport, storage, measurement and monitoring

"With greenhouse gas emission limits imposed, many
integrated assessment analyses indicate that CCS systems will
be competitive with other large-scale mitigation options, such
as nuclear power and renewable energy technologies. Most
energy and economic modelling done to date suggests that
the deployment of CCS systems starts to be significant when
carbon prices begin to reach approximately 25-30 US$/tCO,
(90-110 US$/tC). They foresee the large-scale deployment
of CCS systems within a few decades from the start of any
significant regime for mitigating global warming. The literature
indicates that deployment of CCS systems will increase in line
with the stringency of the modelled emission reduction regime.
Least-cost CO, concentration stabilization scenarios, that
also take into account the economic efficiency of the system,
indicate that emissions mitigation becomes progressively more
stringent over time. Most analyses indicate that, notwithstanding
significant penetration of CCS systems by 2050, the majority
of CCS deployment will occur in the second half of this
century. They also indicate that early CCS deployment will
be in the industrialized nations, with deployment eventually
spreading worldwide. While different scenarios vary the
quantitative mix of technologies needed to meet the modelled
emissions constraint, the literature consensus is that CCS could
be an important component of a broad portfolio of energy
technologies and emission reduction approaches. In addition,
CCS technologies are compatible with the deployment of other
potentially important long-term greenhouse gas mitigation
technologies such as H, production from biomass and fossil
fuels.

The cost of employing a full CCS system for electricity
generation from a fossil-fired power plant is dominated by the
cost of capture. The application of capture technology would
add about 1.8 to 3.4 US$ct kWhr' to the cost of electricity from
a pulverized coal power plant, 0.9 to 2.2 US$ct kWh to the cost
for electricity from an integrated gasification combined cycle
coal power plant, and 1.2 to 2.4 US$ct kWh"" from a natural-
gas combined-cycle power plant. Transport and storage costs
would add between —1 and 1 US$ct kWh! to this range for
coal plants, and about half as much for gas plants. The negative
costs are associated with assumed offsetting revenues from CO,
storage in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) or enhanced coal bed
methane (ECBM) projects. Typical costs for transportation and
geological storage from coal plants would range from 0.05—0.6
US$ct kWh""'. CCS technologies can also be applied to other
industrial processes, such as hydrogen (H,) production. In
some of these non-power applications, the cost of capture is
lower than for capture from fossil-fired power plants, but the
concentrations and partial pressures of CO, in the flue gases
from these sources vary widely, as do the costs. In addition to
fossil-based energy conversion processes, CCS may be applied
to biomass-fed energy systems to create useful energy (electricity
or transportation fuels). The product cost of these systems is
very sensitive to the potential price of the carbon permit and the
associated credits obtained with systems resulting in negative
emissions. These systems can be fuelled solely by biomass, or
biomass can be co-fired in conventional coal-burning plants, in
which case the quantity is normally limited to about 10-15% of
the energy input.

‘How do CCS technologies fit into a portfolio of greenhouse

these questions. Costs for CCS technologies depend on many
factors: fuel prices, the cost of capital, and costs for meeting
potential regulatory requirements like monitoring, to just name
a few. Add to this the uncertainties associated with technology
development, the resource base for storage potential, the
regulatory environment, etc., and it becomes obvious why there

The total cost of CO, capture includes the additional capital
requirements, plus added operating and maintenance costs
incurred for any particular application. For current technologies,
a substantial portion of the overall cost is due to the energy
requirements for capture and compression. As elaborated in
Chapter 3, a large number of technical and economic factors
related to the design and operation of both the CO, capture
system, and the power plant or industrial process to which it is
applied, influence the overall cost of capture. For this reason,
the reported costs of CO, capture vary widely, even for similar
applications.

Given the potential for hundreds to thousands of gigatonnes
of CO, to be stored in various geological formations and the
ocean, questions have been raised about the implications of
gradual leakage from these reservoirs. From an economic
perspective, such leakage — if it were to occur — can be thought
of as another potential source of future CO, emissions, with
the cost of offsetting this leaked CO, being equal to the cost of
emission offsets when the stored CO, leaks to the atmosphere.
Within this purely economic framework, the few studies that
have looked at this topic indicate that some CO, leakage can be
accommodated while progressing towards the goal of stabilizing
atmospheric concentrations of CO,,.

"This chapter starts (in Section 8.2) by looking at the costs
of the system components, namely capture and compression,
transport, and storage (including monitoring costs and by-
product credits from operations such as EOR). The commercial
operations associated with each of these components provide a
basis for the assessment of current costs. Although it involves
greater uncertainty, an assessment is also included of how
these costs will change in the future. The chapter then reviews
the findings from economic modelling (Section 8.3). These
models take component costs at various levels of aggregation
and then model how the costs change with time and how CCS
technologies compete with other CO, mitigation options given
a variety of economic and policy assumptions. The chapter
concludes with an examination of the economic implications
of different storage times (Section 8.4) and a summary of the
known knowledge gaps (Section 8.5).

"Table 8.1 summarizes the CO, capture costs reported in
Chapter 3 for baseload operations of new fossil fuel power
plants (in the size range of 300-800 MW) employing current
commercial technology. The most widely studied systems are
new power plants based on coal combustion or gasification.
For costs associated with retrofitting existing power plants, see
Table 3.8. For a modern (high-efficiency) coal-burning power
plant, CO, capture using an amine-based scrubber increases
the cost of electricity generation (COE) by approximately 40
to 70 per cent while reducing CO, emissions per kilowatt-hour
(kWh) by about 85%. The same CO, capture technology applied
to a new natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plant increases
the COE by approximately 40 to 70 per cent. For a new coal-
based plant employing an integrated gasification combined
cycle (IGCC) system, a similar reduction in CO, using current
technology (in this case, a water gas shift reactor followed by a
physical absorption system) increases the COE by 20 to 55%.
The lower incremental cost for IGCC systems is due in large
part to the lower gas volumes and lower energy requirements
for CO, capture relative to combustion-based systems. It should
be noted that the absence of industrial experience with large-
scale capture of CO, in the electricity sector means that these
numbers are subject to uncertainties, as is explained in Section

Table 8.1 also illustrates the cost of CO, capture in the
production of H,, a commodity used extensively today for fuels
and chemical production, but also widely viewed as a potential
energy carrier for future energy systems. Here, the cost of
CO, capture is mainly due to the cost of CO, compression,
since separation of CO, is already carried out as part of the H,
production process. Recent studies indicate that the cost of CO,
capture for current processes adds approximately 5 to 30 per
cent to the cost of the H, product.

CCS technologies can also be applied to other industrial
processes. Since these other industrial processes produce
off-gases that are very diverse in terms of pressure and CO,
concentration, the costs range very widely. In some of these
non-power applications where a relatively pure CO, stream
is produced as a by-product of the process (e.g., natural gas
processing, ammonia production), the cost of capture is
significantly lower than capture from fossil-fuel-fired power
plants. In other processes like cement or steel production,
capture costs are similar to, or even higher than, capture from
fossil-fuel-fired power plants.

The three major cost elements for pipelines are construction
costs (e.g., material, labour, possible booster station), operation
and maintenance costs (e.g., monitoring, maintenance, possible
energy costs) and other costs (e.g., design, insurance, fees,
right-of-way). Special land conditions, like heavily populated
areas, protected areas such as national parks, or crossing
major waterways, may have significant cost impacts. Offshore
pipelines are about 40% to 70% more costly than onshore pipes
of the same size. Pipeline construction is considered to be a
mature technology and the literature does not foresee many cost
reductions.

"Studies indicate that, in most cases, IGCC plants are slightly
higher in cost without capture and slightly lower in cost with
capture than similarly sized PC plants fitted with a CCS
system. On average, NGCC systems have a lower COE than
both types of new coal-based plants with or without capture
for baseload operation. However, the COE for each of these
systems can vary markedly due to regional variations in fuel
cost, plant utilization, and a host of other parameters. NGCC
costs are especially sensitive to the price of natural gas, which
has risen significantly in recent years. So comparisons of
alternative power system costs require a particular context to
be meaningful.

New or improved technologies for CO, capture, combined
with advanced power systems and industrial process designs,
can significantly reduce the cost of CO, capture in the future.
While there is considerable uncertainty about the magnitude
and timing of future cost reductions, studies suggest that
improvements to current commercial technologies could lower
CO, capture costs by at least 20-30%, while new technologies
currently under development may allow for more substantial
cost reductions in the future. Previous experience indicates that
the realization of cost reductions in the future requires sustained
R&D in conjunction with the deployment and adoption of
commercial technologies.

"For existing, combustion-based, power plants, CO, capture
can be accomplished by retrofitting an amine scrubber to the
existing plant. However, a limited number of studies indicate
that the post-combustion retrofit option is more cost-effective
when accompanied by a major rebuild of the boiler and turbine
to increase the efficiency and output of the existing plant by
converting it to a supercritical unit. For some plants, similar
benefits can be achieved by repowering with an IGCC system
that includes CO, capture technology. The feasibility and cost
of any of these options is highly dependent on site-specific
circumstances, including the size, age and type of unit, and
the availability of space for accommodating a CO, capture
system. There has not yet been any systematic comparison of
the feasibility and cost of alternative retrofit and repowering
options for existing plants, as well as the potential for more
cost-effective options employing advanced technology such as
oxyfuel combustion.

In addition to fossil-based energy conversion processes, CO,
could also be captured in power plants fuelled with biomass.
At present, biomass plants are small in scale (<100 MW,).
Hence, the resulting costs of capturing CO, are relatively high
compared to fossil alternatives. For example, the capturing of
0.19 MtCO, yr! in a 24 MW, biomass IGCC plant is estimated
to be about 82 US$/tCO, (300 US$/tC), corresponding to an
increase of the electricity costs due to capture of about 80
US$ MWh! (Audus and Freund, 2004). Similarly, CO, could
be captured in biomass-fuelled H, plants. The cost is reported
to be between 22 and 25 US$/tCO, avoided (80-92 US$/tC)
in a plant producing 1 million Nm? d-' of H, (Makihira et al.,
2003). This corresponds to an increase in the H, product costs
of about 2.7 US$ GF (i.e., 20% of the H, costs without CCS).
The competitiveness of biomass CCS systems is very sensitive
to the value of CO, emission reductions, and the associated
credits obtained with systems resulting in negative emissions.
Moreover, significantly larger biomass plants could benefit from

The full range of cost estimates for individual options is
very large. Cost information for storage monitoring is currently
limited, but monitoring is estimated to add 0.1-0.3 US$ per
tonne of CO, stored (0.4-1.1 US$/tC). These estimates do not
include any well remediation or long-term liabilities. The costs

"To transport 6 MtCO, per year a distance of 500 km by
ship would cost about 10 US$/tCO, (37 US$/tC) or 5 US$/
tCO,/250km (18 US$/tC/250km). However, since the cost
is relatively insensitive to distance, transporting the same 6
MtCO, a distance of 1250 km would cost about 15 US$/tCO,
(55 US$/tC) or 3 US$/tCO,/250km (11 US$/tC/250km). This is
close to the cost of pipeline transport, illustrating the point that
ship transport becomes cost-competitive with pipeline transport
if CO, needs to be transported over larger distances. However,
the break-even point beyond which ship transportation becomes
cheaper than pipeline transportation is not simply a matter of
distance; it involves many other aspects.

When storage is combined with EOR, enhanced gas recovery
(EGR) or ECBM, the benefits of enhanced production can offset
some of the capture and storage costs. Onshore EOR operations
have paid in the range of 10-16 US$ per tonne of CO, (37-59
US$/tC). The economic benefit of enhanced production depends
very much on oil and gas prices. It should be noted that most
of the literature used as the basis for this report did not take
into account the rise in oil and gas prices that started in 2003.
For example, oil at 50 US$/barrel could justify a credit of 30
US$/tCO, (110 US$/tC). The economic benefits from enhanced
production make EOR and ECBM potential early cost-effective
options for geological storage.

carbonates. These are conventional mining operations and
several studies have produced cost estimates of 10 US$/tCO,

mature and efficient operations, this implies that there is a
strong lower limit on the cost of mineral storage. Carbonation
costs include chemical activation and carbonation. Translating

In general, the capture, transport, and storage of CO, require energy inputs. For a power plant, this means that amount of fuel
input (and therefore CO, emissions) increases per unit of net power output. As a result, the amount of CO, produced per unit
of product (e.g., a kWh of electricity) is greater for the power plant with CCS than the reference plant, as shown in Figure 8.2
To determine the CO, reductions one can attribute to CCS, one needs to compare CO, emissions of the plant with capture to
those of the reference plant without capture. These are the avoided emissions. Unless the energy requirements for capture and
storage are zero, the amount of CO, avoided is always less than the amount of CO, captured. The cost in US$/tonne avoided
is therefore greater than the cost in US$/tonne captured.

economic variables. Econometric relationships between
aggregated variables are generally more reliable than those
between disaggregated variables, and the behaviour of the
models tends to be more stable. It is therefore common to adopt
high levels of aggregation for top-down models; especially
when they are applied to longer-term analyses. Technology

Both types of models have their strengths and weaknesses.
Top-down models are useful for, among other things, calculating
gross economic cost estimates for emissions mitigation. Most of
these top-down macro-economic models tend to overstate costs
of meeting climate change targets because, among other reasons,
they do not take adequate account of the potential for no-regret
measures and they are not particularly adept at estimating the
benefits of climate change mitigation. On the other hand, many
of these models — and this also applies to bottom-up models
— are not adept at representing economic and institutional
inefficiencies, which would lead to an underestimation of
emissions mitigation costs.

where a specific set of measures designed to constrain GHG
emissions is modelled). It is therefore important to understand
what influences the nature of these baseline scenarios. A
number of parameters spanning economic, technological,
natural and demographic resources shape the energy use and

these parameters change over time is another important aspect
driving the baseline scenarios. A partial list of some of the

baseline scenarios. This is best exemplified by the Special
Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES, 2000): it included four
different narrative storylines and associated scenario families,
and identified six ‘illustrative’ scenario groups — labelled
AIFI, A1B, AIT, A2, B1, B2 — each representing different
plausible combinations of socio-economic and technological

Energy and economic models are increasingly being employed to
examine how CCS technologies would deploy in environments
where CO, emissions are constrained (i.e., in control cases). A
number of factors have been identified that drive the rate of
CCS deployment and the scale of its ultimate deployment in
modelled control cases:""!
"	Text
"The marginal value of CO, emission reduction permits is one
of the most important mechanisms through which these factors
impact CCS deployment. CCS systems tend to deploy quicker
and more extensively in cases with higher marginal carbon
values. Most energy and economic modelling done to date
suggests that CCS systems begin to deploy at a significant level
when carbon dioxide prices begin to reach approximately 25—
30 US$/tCO, (90-110 US$/tC) (IEA, 2004; Johnson and Keith,
2004; Wise and Dooley, 2004; McFarland et al., 2004). The only
caveat to this carbon price as a lower limit for the deployment
of these systems is the ‘early opportunities’ literature discussed

"different implications for the potential use of CCS technologies
in emissions control cases.'° Generally, the size of the future
market for CCS depends mostly on the carbon intensity
of the baseline scenario and the stringency of the assumed
climate stabilization target. The higher the CO, emissions in
the baseline, the more emissions reductions are required to
achieve a given level of allowable emissions, and the larger the
markets for CCS. Likewise, the tighter the modelled constraint
on CO, emissions, the more CCS deployment there is likely
to be. This section will examine what the literature says about
possible CCS deployment rates, the timing of CCS deployment,
the total deployment of these systems under various scenarios,
the economic impact of CCS systems and how CCS systems
interact with other emissions mitigation technologies.

The policy regime; the interaction between CCS deployment
and the policy regime in which energy is produced and
consumed cannot be overemphasized; the magnitude and
timing of early deployment depends very much on the
policy environment; in particular, the cumulative extent
of deployment over the long term depends strongly on
the stringency of the emissions mitigation regime being
modelled; comparatively low stabilization targets (e.g., 450
ppmv) foster the relatively faster penetration of CCS and
the more intensive use of CCS (where ‘intensity of use’ is
measured both in terms of the percentage of the emissions
reduction burden shouldered by CCS as well as in terms of
how many cumulative gigatonnes of CO, is to be stored)
(Dooley et al., 2004b; Gielen and Podanski, 2004; Riahi

"The reference case (baseline); storage requirements for
stabilizing CO, concentrations at a given level are very
sensitive to the choice of the baseline scenario. In other
words, the assumed socio-economic and demographic
trends, and particularly the assumed rate of technological
change, have a significant impact on CCS use (see Section
8.3.1, Riahi and Roehrl, 2000; Riahi et al., 2003);

The nature, abundance and carbon intensity of the energy
resources / fuels assumed to exist in the future (e.g., a
future world where coal is abundant and easily recoverable
would use CCS technologies more intensively than a
world in which natural gas or other less carbon-intensive
technologies are inexpensive and widely available). See
Edmonds and Wise (1998) and Riahi and Roehrl (2000)
for a comparison of two alternative regimes of fossil fuel
availability and their interaction with CCS;

The introduction of flexible mechanisms such as emissions
trading can significantly influence the extent of CCS
deployment. For example, an emissions regime with few,
or significantly constrained, emissions trading between
nations entails the use of CCS technologies sooner and
more extensively than a world in which there is efficient
global emissions trading and therefore lower carbon permit
prices (e.g., Dooley et al., 2000 and Scott et al., 2004).
Certain regulatory regimes that explicitly emphasize CCS
usage can also accelerate its deployment (e.g., Edmonds
and Wise, 1998).

The rate of technological change (induced through learning
or other mechanisms) assumed to take place with CCS and
other salient mitigation technologies (e.g., Edmonds et al.,
2003, or Riahi et al., 2003). For example, Riahi et al. (2003)
indicate that the long-term economic potential of CCS
systems would increase by a factor of 1.5 if it assumed that
technological learning for CCS systems would take place
at rates similar to those observed historically for sulphur
removal technologies when compared to the situation
where no technological change is specified.'”

The uncertainty with respect to the future deployment of
CCS and its contribution to total emissions reductions for
achieving stabilization of CO, concentrations between 450 and
750 ppmv is illustrated by the IPCC TAR mitigation scenarios
(Morita et al., 2000; 2001). The TAR mitigation scenarios are
based upon SRES baseline scenarios and were developed by nine
different modelling teams. In total, 76 mitigation scenarios were
developed for TAR, and about half of them (36 scenarios from
three alternative models: DNE21, MARIA, and MESSAGE)
consider CO, capture and storage explicitly as a mitigation
option. An overview of the TAR scenarios is presented in Morita
et al. (2000). It includes eleven publications from individual
modelling teams about their scenario assumptions and results.

In accordance with the B2 storyline, gross world product is assumed to grow from US$ 20 trillion in 1990 to about US$

place in today’s developing countries. The scenarios adopt the UN median 1998 population projection (UN, 1998), which
assumes a continuation of historical trends, including recent faster-than-expected fertility declines, towards a completion of the

Recently, two detailed studies of the cost of CO, transport and

These studies concur about the large potential of CO, storage

current CO, point sources could be transported and stored in
candidate geologic formations for less than 12-15 US$/tCO,
in North America and 25 US$/tCO, in Western Europe. These

Both studies conclude that, at least for these two regions, the
CO, storage supply curves are dominated by a very large single
plateau (hundreds to thousands of gigatonnes of CO,), implying
roughly constant costs for a wide range of storage capacity’.
In other words, at a practical level, the cost of CO, transport
and storage in these regions will have a cap. These studies and a
handful of others (see, for example, IEA GHG, 2002) have also
shown that early (i.e., low cost) opportunities for CO, capture
and storage hinge upon a number of factors: an inexpensive
(e.g., high-purity) source of CO,; a (potentially) active area of
advanced hydrocarbon recovery (either EOR or ECBM); and
the relatively close proximity of the CO, point source to the
candidate storage reservoir in order to minimize transportation
costs. These bottom-up studies provide some of the most
detailed insights into the graded CCS resources presently
available, showing that the set of CCS opportunities likely to be

that this deployment will expand significantly after the middle

Given these models’ relatively coarse top-down view of the
world, there is less agreement about when the first commercial
CCS units will become operational. This is —at least in part
—attributable to the importance of policy in creating the context
in which initial units will deploy. For example, McFarland et al.

modelling exercises have shown CCS systems beginning to
deploy —at a lower level of less than 370 MtCO, a year (100 MtC

in 2010-2020. In a large body of literature (Edmonds et al.

For example, in the high economic growth and carbon-intensive
baseline scenarios (A1FI), the development path of CCS is
characterized by steadily increasing contributions, driven by
the rapidly growing use of hydrocarbon resources. By contrast,
other scenarios (e.g., AIB and B2) depict CCS deployment
to peak during the second half of the century. In a number of
these scenarios, the contribution of CCS declines to less than
11 GtCO, per year (3 GtC per year) until the end of the century.
These scenarios reflect the fact that CCS could be viewed as
a transitional mitigation option (bridging the transition from
today’s fossil-intensive energy system to a post-fossil system
with sizable contributions from renewables).

McFarland et al. (2003) foresee the eventual deployment of

of the entry of CCS technologies into a particular region is
influenced by local conditions such as the relative price of coal

policy regime, and in particular the extent of emissions trading,
can influence where CCS technologies are deployed. In the
specific case examined by this paper, it was demonstrated that,
where emissions trading was severely constrained (and where
the cost of abatement was therefore higher), CCS technologies
tended to deploy more quickly and more extensively in the US
and the EU. On the other hand, in the absence of an efficient
emissions-trading system spanning all of the Annex B nations,
CCS was used less intensively and CCS utilization was spread
more evenly across these nations as the EU and US found it
cheaper to buy CCS-derived emission allowances from regions
like the former Soviet Union.

Similarly, Riahi et al. (2004) estimate that up-front investments

"As noted above, the future deployment of CCS will depend on
a number of factors, many of which interact with each other.
The deployment of CCS will be impacted by factors such as
the development and deployment of renewable energy and
nuclear power (Mori, 2000). Edmonds ef al. (2003) report
that CCS technologies can synergistically interact with other
technologies and in doing so help to lower the cost and therefore
increase the overall economic potential of less carbon-intensive
technologies. The same authors note that these synergies are
perhaps particularly important for the combination of CCS,
H, production technologies and H, end-use systems (e.g.,
fuel cells). On the other hand, the widespread availability of
CCS technologies implies an ability to meet a given emissions
reduction at a lower marginal cost, reducing demand for
substitute technologies at the margin. In other words, CCS is
competing with some technologies, such as energy-intensity
improvements, nuclear, fusion, solar power options, and wind.
The nature of that interaction depends strongly on the climate
policy environment and the costs and potential of alternative
mitigation options, which are subject to large variations
depending on site-specific, local conditions (IPCC, 2001).
At the global level, which is spatially more aggregated, this
variation translates into the parallel deployment of alternative
options, taking into account the importance of a diversified
technology portfolio for addressing emissions mitigation in a
cost-effective way.

"capacity. In this framework, where the cost of CO, storage varies
across the globe depending upon the quantity, quality (including
proximity) and type of CO, storage reservoirs present in the
region, as well as upon the demand for CO, storage (driven by
factors such as the size of the regional economy, the stringency
of the modelled emissions reduction regime), the authors show
that the use of CCS across the globe can be grouped into three
broad categories: (1) countries in which the use of CCS does
not appear to face either an economic or physical constraint on
CCS deployment given the large potential CO, storage resource
compared to projected demand (e.g., Australia, Canada, and the
United States) and where CCS should therefore deploy to the
extent that it makes economic sense to do so; (2) countries in
which the supply of potential geological storage reservoirs (the
authors did not consider ocean storage) is small in comparison
to potential demand (e.g., Japan and South Korea) and where
other abatement options must therefore be pressed into service
to meet the modelled emissions reduction levels; and (3) the
rest of the world in which the degree to which CCS deployment
is constrained is contingent upon the stringency of the emission
constraint and the useable CO, storage resource. The authors
note that discovering the true CO, storage potential in regions
of the world is a pressing issue; knowing whether a country or a
region has ‘sufficient’ CO, storage capacity is a critical variable
in these modelling analyses because it can fundamentally alter
the way in which a country’s energy infrastructure evolves in
response to various modelled emissions constraints.

the latter case, with CCS modelled as a backstop technology,

in storage for geological and ocean reservoirs respectively. For
example, Box 6.7 suggests four types of measures for ocean
storage: storage efficiency, airborne fraction, net present value,
and global warming potential. Chapter 9 discusses accounting
issues relating to the possible impermanence of stored CO,.
Chapter 9 also contains a review of the broader literature on the

Herzog er al. (2003) suggest that CO, storage and leakage
can be looked upon as two separate, discrete events. They
represent the value of temporary storage as a familiar economic
problem, with explicitly stated assumptions about the discount
rate and carbon prices. If someone stores a tonne of CO, today,
they will be credited with today’s carbon price. Any future
leakage will have to be compensated by paying the carbon price
in effect at that time. Whether non-permanent storage options
will be economically attractive depends on assumptions about
the leakage rate, discount rate and relative carbon permit prices.
In practice, this may turn out to be a difficult issue since the
commercial entity that undertakes the storage may no longer
exist when leakage rates have been clarified (as Baer (2003)
points out), and hence governments or society at large might
need to cover the leakage risk of many storage sites rather than

the entity that undertakes the storage.

Quantified commitments, emission trading or other similar
mechanisms need clear rules and methodologies for accounting
for emissions and removals. There are several challenges for
the accounting frameworks. Firstly, there is a lack of knowledge
about the rate of physical leakage from different storage options
including possibilities for accidental releases over a very long
time period (issues of permanence and liability). Secondly, there
are the implications of the additional energy requirements of the
options; and the issues of liability and economic leakage where

framework, the main concepts and methodologies used in

for reporting CCS systems. In addition, areas are identified
where existing methodologies could be used to include these
systems in the inventories, and areas where new methodologies
(including emission/removal factors and uncertainty estimates)
would need to be developed. Treatment of CCS in corporate or

Issues related to accounting? under the Kyoto Protocol;
or under other similar accounting schemes that would limit
emissions, provide credits for emission reductions, or encourage

issues). The section addresses issues that could warrant special
tules and modalities in accounting schemes because of specific
features of CCS systems, such as permanence of CO, storage
and liability issues related to transportation and storage in
international territories and across national borders. Specific
consideration is also given to CCS systems in relation to the

"The literature on accounting for the potential impermanence of
stored CO, focuses on sequestration in the terrestrial biosphere.
Although notably different from CCS in oceans or in geological
reservoirs (with respect to ownership, the role of management,
measurement and monitoring, expected rate of physical
leakage; modes of potential physical leakage; and assignment
of liability), there are similarities. Accounting approaches, such
as discounting, the ton-year approach, and rented or temporary
credits, are discussed. Ultimately, political processes will decide
the value of temporary storage and allocation of responsibility
for stored carbon. Precedents set by international agreements
on sequestration in the terrestrial biosphere provide some
guidance, but there are important differences that will have to
be considered.

"The IPCC Guidelines and Good Practice Guidance reports
(GPG2000 and GPG-LULUCF) ‘are used in preparing national
inventories under the UNFCCC. These guidelines do not
specifically address CO, capture and storage, but the general
framework and concepts could be applied for this purpose. The
IPCC guidelines give guidance for reporting on annual emissions
by gas and by sector. The amount of CO, captured and stored
can be measured, and could be reflected in the relevant sectors
and categories producing the emissions, or in new categories
created specifically for CO, capture, transportation and storage
in the reporting framework. In the first option, CCS would be
treated as a mitigation measure and, for example, power plants
with CO, capture or use of decarbonized fuels would have
lower emissions factors (kgCO,/kg fuel used) than conventional
systems. In the second option, the captured and stored amounts
would be reported as removals (sinks) for CO,. In both options,
emissions from fossil fuel use due to the additional energy
requirements in the capture, transportation and injection
processes would be covered by current methodologies. But
under the current framework, they would not be allocated to the

the stored amount of CO, would be reported as a removal in
the inventory. Application of the second option would require
adoption of new definitions not available in the UNFCCC or
in the current methodological framework for the preparation
of inventories. UNFCCC (1992) defines a sink as ‘any
process, activity or mechanism which removes a greenhouse
gas, an aerosol, or a precursor of a greenhouse gas from the
atmosphere’. Although ‘removal’ was not included explicitly in
the UNFCCC definitions, it appears associated with the ‘sink’
concept. CCS""! systems do not meet the UNFCCC definition for
a sink, but given that the definition was agreed without having
CCS systems in mind, it is likely that this obstacle could be
solved (Torvanger et al., 2005).

The IPCC methodologies for estimating and reporting national greenhouse gas inventories are based on sectoral guidance for
reporting of actual emissions and removals of greenhouse gases by gas and by year. The PCC Guidelines give the framework
for the reporting (sectors, categories and sub-categories), default methodologies and default emission/removal factors (the
so called Tier 1 methodologies) for the estimation. Higher tier methodologies are based on more sophisticated methods for
estimating emissions/removals and on the use of national or regional parameters that accommodate the specific national
circumstances. These methodologies are not always described in detail in the IPCC Guidelines. Use of transparent and well-
documented national methodologies consistent with those in the JPCC Guidelines is encouraged.

In the first option, reduced emissions could be reported in
the category where capture takes place. For instance, capture
in power plants could be reported using lower emission factors
than for plants without CCS. But this could reduce transparency
of reporting and make review of the overall impact on emissions
more difficult, especially if the capture process and emissions
from transportation and storage are not linked. This would be
emphasized where transportation and storage includes captured
CO, from many sources, or when these take place across national
borders. An alternative would be to track CO, flows through the
entire capture and storage system making transparent how much
CO, was produced, how much was emitted to the atmosphere
at each process stage, and how much CO, was transferred to
storage. This latter approach, which appears fully transparent
and consistent with earlier UNFCCC agreements, is described
in this chapter.

The Good Practice Guidance (GPG) reports facilitate the development of inventories in which the emissions/removals are not
over- or under-estimated, so far as can be judged, and in which the uncertainties are reduced as far as practicable. Further aims
are to produce transparent, documented, consistent, complete, comparable inventories, which are i) assessed for uncertainties,
1i) subject to quality assurance and quality control, and iii) efficient in the use of resources. The GPG reports give guidance on
how to choose the appropriate methodologies for specific categories in a country, depending on the importance of the category
(key category analysis is used to determine the importance) and on availability of data and resources for the estimation.
Decision trees guide the choice of estimation method most suited to the national circumstances. The category-specific guidance
linked to the decision trees also provides information on the choice of emission factors and activity data. The GPG reports give

* Capture, transportation and injection of CO, into storage
requires energy (the additional energy requirements have been
addressed in previous chapters). Greenhouse gas emissions
from this energy use are covered by the methodologies and
reporting framework in the PCC Guidelines and GPG2000.
Additional methodologies and emission factors can be
found in other extensive literature, such as EEA (2001) and
US EPA (1995, 2000). Where capture processes take place
at the fuel production site, the emissions from the fuel used
in the capture process may not be included in the national

source may be needed. In the current reporting framework,
emissions from the additional energy requirements would
not be linked to the CCS system.

sectors under which the specific phases of the CCS systems
could be reported. The reporting of emissions/removals
associated with CO, capture, transportation, injection and
storage processes should be described clearly to fulfil the
requirement of transparent reporting.

Spatial boundaries: National inventories include greenhouse
gas emissions and removals taking place within national
(including administered) territories and offshore areas over
which that country has jurisdiction. Some of the emissions
and removals of CCS systems could occur outside the areas
under the jurisdiction of the reporting country, an aspect that
requires additional consideration and is addressed mainly in
Section 9.3.

Temporal boundaries: Inventories are prepared on a
calendar year basis. Some aspects of CCS systems (such
as the amount of CO, captured or fugitive emissions from
transportation) could easily be incorporated into an annual
reporting system (yearly estimates would be required).
However, other emissions (for example, physical leakage
of CO, from geological storage) can occur over a very long
period after the injection has been completed - time frames
range from hundreds to even millions of years (see further
discussion in Section 9.3).

The capture processes are well defined in space and time, and
their emissions (from additional energy use, fugitives, etc.)
could be covered by current national and annual inventory
systems. The capture processes would result in reduced
emissions from industrial plants, power plants and other sites
of fuel combustion. For estimation purposes, the reduced CO,
emissions could be determined by measuring the amount of
CO, captured and deducting this from the total amount of CO,
produced (see Figure 8.2 in Chapter 8).

Total emissions from pipelines could be calculated on the
basis of the net difference between the intake and discharge flow
rates of the pipelines. Because CO, is transported in pipelines as
a supercritical or dense phase fluid, the effect of the surrounding
temperature on the estimated flow rate would need to be taken
into account. Volumetric values would need to be corrected
accordingly when CO, is transmitted from a cooler climate to a
moderate or hot climate, and vice versa. In some cases, fugitive
losses could be lower than metering accuracy tolerances. Hence,
all metering devices measuring CO, export and injection should
be to a given standard and with appropriate tolerances applied.
But metering uncertainties may prohibit measurement of small

Any fugitive emissions or accidental releases from
transportation modes could be covered in the Energy sector
under the category ‘Fugitive Emissions’. CO, emissions
from a pipeline can occur at the intake side during pumping
and compression, at the pipeline joints, or at the storage site.
Emission rates can differ from surface, underground and sub-
sea pipelines. Explicit guidance for CO, transportation in
pipelines is not given in the current IPCC methodologies, but a
methodology for natural gas pipelines is included. A distinction
is to be made between leakage during normal operation and
CO, losses during accidents or other physical disruptions. As
described in Chapter 4, statistics on the incident rate in pipelines
for natural gas and CO, varied from 0.00011 to 0.00032 incidents

The long-term physical leakage of stored CO, (escape of

Different options exist to report these emissions in the

Application of CCS to CO, emissions from biomass
combustion, and to other CO, emissions of biological origin
(for example, fermentation processes in the production
of food and drinks) would require specific treatment
in inventories. It is generally assumed that combustion
of biomass fuels results in zero net CO, emissions if the
biomass fuels are produced sustainably. In this case, the
CO, released by combustion is balanced by CO, taken up
during photosynthesis. In greenhouse gas inventories, CO,
emissions from biomass combustion are, therefore, not
reported under Energy. Any unsustainable production should
be evident in the calculation of CO, emissions and removals
in Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry Sector. Thus,
CCS from biomass sources would be reported as negative

Some estimates of CO, emissions (physical leakage rates)
from geological and ocean storage are given in Chapters 5
and 6. Physical leakage rates are estimated to be very small
for geological formations chosen with care. In oil reservoirs
and coal seams, storage times could be significantly altered if
exploitation or mining activities in these fields are undertaken
after CO, storage. Some of the CO, injected into oceans would
be released to the atmosphere over a period of hundreds to
thousands of years, depending on the depth and location of
injection.

Use of this simple equation requires estimates or
measurements of the injected CO, mass and either default values
of the amount of CO, emitted from the different storage types, or
rigorous source-specific evaluation of mass escaped CO,. This
approach would be possible when accurate measurements of
mass of injected and escaped CO, are applied on site. Thus, for
monitoring possible physical leakage of CO, from geological
formations, direct measurement methods for CO, detection,
geochemical methods and tracers, or indirect measurement
methods for CO, plume detection could be applied (see Section
5.6, Monitoring and verification technology).

"Most industrial uses of CO, result in release of the gas to the
atmosphere, often after a very short time period. Because
of the short ‘storage times’, no change may be required in
the inventory systems provided they are robust enough to
avoid possible double counting or omission of emissions.
The benefits of these systems are related to the systems they
substitute for, and the relative net efficiencies of the alternate
systems. Comparison of the systems would need to take into
account the whole cycle from capture to use of CO,. As an
example, methanol production by CO, hydrogenation could be
a substitute for methanol production from fossil fuels, mainly
natural gas. The impacts of the systems are in general covered
by current inventory systems, although they are not addressed
explicitly, because the emissions and emission reductions are
related to relative energy use (reduction or increase depending
on the process alternatives).

leakage effects and the additional energy requirements will

in one country but released in another country or at a later time.
Also, CCs requires energy and likely additional emissions of
CO, to produce this additional energy. Yoshigahara et al. (2004)
note that emission reduction through CCS technology differs
from many other modes of emission reduction. Although the
former avoids CO, release to the atmosphere, it creates the
long-term possibility that stored CO, could eventually flow to
the atmosphere through physical leakage.

One ton of CO, permanently stored has the same benefit in terms

than one ton of CO, emissions avoided. This difference can
be reflected in the accounting system. Accounting for CCS
may have to go beyond measuring the amount of CO, stored
in order to ensure the credibility of storage credits and that
credits claimed are commensurate with benefits gained. CO,
storage should not avoid properly accounting for emissions that
have been moved to other times, other places, or other sectors.

Concern about leakage among countries, sectors, or
gases; or physical leakage from reservoirs is largely about the
completeness and accuracy of emissions accounting. Kennett
(2003), for example, emphasizes the importance of ‘establishing
general rules and procedures to simplify transactions, and
increasing certainty by defining legal rights and by providing
dispute resolution and enforcement procedures’ and of ensuring
the credibility of sinks-based emissions offsets or storage-based
emissions reductions. The operation of a market requires clearly
defined rights (i.e. who has the rights to the carbon stored),
what those rights entail, how those rights can be transferred,
and liability and remedies in the event of unanticipated release
(Kennett, 2003). The core of establishing rights, liabilities, and
markets will be the accounting and certification systems. Yet, a
well-designed accounting system should not lead to transaction
costs that unnecessarily discourage meritorious activities.

a significant number of publications on accounting for the

The literature suggests various accounting strategies so that
sequestration in the biosphere could be treated as the negative
equivalent of emissions. Sequestration could be shown in
national emission accounts and trading of emissions credits, and
debits between parties could occur for sequestration activities
in the terrestrial biosphere. Whether CCS is treated as a CO,

physical leakage from storage are similar.

step further and argue that while CO, storage is not permanent,
reducing emissions may not be permanent either, unless some
backstop energy technology assures all fossil fuel resources are
not eventually consumed. According to Herzog et al. (2003),
stored CO, emissions are little different, to fossil fuel resources

potential debits are transferred sufficiently far into the future
with little assurance that the systems and institutions of liability
will still be in place if and when CO, is released. The system
of expiring credits in the Marrakech Accords for sequestration
in the terrestrial biosphere fulfils the requirement of continuing
liability. Limiting these credits to five years provides reasonable
assurance that the liable institutions will still be responsible.
This arrangement also addresses an important concern of those
who might host CO, storage projects, that they might be liable
in perpetuity for stored CO,. Under most proposals, the hosts for
CO, storage would be liable for losses until credits expire and
then liability would return to the purchaser/renter of the expiring
credits. Kennett (2003) suggests that long-term responsibility
for regulating, monitoring, certifying, and supporting credits
will ultimately fall to governments (see also section 5.8.4).
With this kind of ultimate responsibility, governments may
wish to establish minimum requirements for CCS reservoirs

The published discussions on ‘permanence’ have
largely been in the context of sequestration in the terrestrial
biosphere. It is not clear whether the evolving conclusions
are equally appropriate for CCS in the ocean or in geological
reservoirs. Important differences between modes of CCS
may influence the accounting scheme chosen (see Table 9.2).
An apparent distinction is that sequestration in the terrestrial
biosphere involves initial release of CO, to the atmosphere
and subsequent removal by growing plants. But as storage in
geological reservoirs does not generally involve release to the
atmosphere, it might be envisioned as a decrease in emissions
rather than as balancing source with sink. In either case, a mass
of CO, must be managed and isolated from the atmosphere.
Storage in the terrestrial biosphere leaves open the possibility
that sequestration will be reversed because of decisions on
maintenance or priorities for resource management. Ocean and
geological storage have very different implications for the time
scale of commitments and for the role of physical processes
versus decisions in potential physical releases.

for sequestration in the terrestrial biosphere include (under the
first approach) ton-year accounting (described below); and
(under the second approach) various combinations of reserve
credits and insurance replacing lost CO, by sequestration reserves
or other permanent emissions reductions. For further discussion
on these issues, see Watson et al., 2000; Marland et al., 2001;
Subak, 2003; Aukland et al., 2003; Wong and Dutschke, 2003;
and Herzog et al., 2003. There are also proposals to discount
credits so that there is a margin of conservativeness in the
number of credits acknowledged. With this kind of discussion
and uncertainty, negotiations toward the Kyoto Protocol have
chosen to place limits on the number of credits that can be
claimed for some categories of terrestrial CO, sequestration
during the Protocol’s first commitment period (UNFCCC,

"To illustrate the concept of allotting credits in proportion
to storage time, one alternative, the ton-year approach is
described. The ton-year alternative for accounting defines an
artificial equivalence so that capture and storage for a given
time interval (for example, t years) are equated with permanent
storage. Availability of credits can be defined in different ways
but typically capture and storage for one year would result in
a number of credits equal to 1/t, and thus storage for t years
would result in one full credit (Watson et al., 2000). A variety
of constructs have been proposed for defining the number of
storage years that would be equated with permanent storage
(see, for example, Marland et al., 2001). But as Chomitz (2000)
points out, despite being based on scientific and technical
considerations, this equivalence is basically a political decision.
Although ton-year accounting typifies the first approach, it has
been subject to considerable discussion. Another derivative
of Chomitz’s first approach that has been further developed
within negotiations on the Kyoto Protocol (Columbia, 2000;
UNFCCC, 2002; UNFCCC, 2004) is the idea of expiring credits
or rented temporary credits (Marland et el., 2001; Subak, 2003).
Temporary or rented credits would have full value over a time
period defined by rule or by contract, but would result in debits
or have to be replaced by permanent credits at expiration. In
essence, credit for stored CO, would create liability for the
possible subsequent CO, release or commitment to storage was

ended.

"At the other temporal extreme, Kheshgi et al. (1994) point
out that over the very long term of equilibration between the
ocean and atmosphere (over 1000 years), capture and storage
in the ocean will lead to higher CO, levels in the atmosphere
than without emissions controls, because of the additional
energy requirements for operating the system. It is also true that
chronic physical leakage over long time periods could increase
the difficulty of meeting targets for net emissions at some time
in the future (see Hawkins, 2003; Hepple and Benson, 2003;
and Pacala, 2003).

Ultimately, the political process will decide the value of
temporary storage and the allocation of responsibility for
stored CO,. Some guidance is provided by precedents set by
international agreements on sequestration in the terrestrial
biosphere. But there are important differences to be considered.
The reason for rules and policies is presumably to influence
behaviour. Accounting rules for CO, storage can best influence
permanence if they are aimed accordingly: at liability for
CO, stored in the terrestrial biosphere but at the initial design
and implementation requirements for CCS in the oceans or
geological reservoirs.

The fundamental question is then, how to deal with
impermanent storage of CO,. Although Findsen er al. (2003)
detail many circumstances where accounting for CCS is
beginning or underway, and although the rates of physical
leakage for well-designed systems may sometimes be in the
range of the uncertainty of other components of emissions, the
risks of physical leakage need to be acknowledged. A number
of questions remains to be answered: how to deal with liability
and continuity of institutions in perpetuity, how to quantify the
benefits of temporary storage; the needs in terms of monitoring
and verification, whether or not there is a need for a reserve
of credits or other ways to assure that losses will be replaced,

The term ‘baseline’, used mostly in the context of project-
based accounting, is a hypothetical scenario for greenhouse
gas emissions in the absence of a greenhouse gas reduction
project or activity (WRI, 2004). Emission baselines are the
basis for calculation of net reductions (for example, storage) of
emissions from any project-based activity. Baselines need to be
established to show the net benefits of emissions reductions. The
important issue is to determine which factors need to be taken
into account when developing an emissions baseline. At present,
there is little guidance on how to calculate net reductions in CO,
emissions through CCS project-based activities. An appropriate
baseline scenario could minimize the risk that a project receives
credits for avoiding emissions that would have been avoided in
the absence of the project (Haefeli et al., 2004).

The previous section deals largely with the possibility that CO,
emissions stored now will be released at a later time. It also
introduces the possibility that emissions stored now will result in
additional, current emissions in different countries or in different
sectors. CO, injected into the ocean could leak physically
from international waters. Accounting for stored CO, raises
questions such as responsibility for the emissions from energy
used in CO, transport and injection, especially if transport and/
or storage is in a developing country or in international waters.
Similarly, questions about physical leakage of stored CO, will
need to address liability for current year physical leakage that
occurs in developing countries or from international waters.
These questions may be especially complex when multiple
countries have injected CO, into a common reservoir such as
the deep Atlantic Ocean, or into a deep aquifer under multiple
countries, or if multiple countries share a common pipeline for
CO, transport.

"Further, Haefeli et al. (2004) note that CCS is not explicitly
addressed in any form in CO, reporting schemes that include
projects (i.e., the Chicago Climate Exchange and the EU
Directive for Establishing a Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Trading Scheme (implemented in 2005) along with the EU
Linking Directive (linking the EU Emissions Trading Scheme
with JI and the CDM). At present, it is unclear how CCS will
be dealt with in practice. According to Haines et al. (2004), the
eligibility of CCS under CDM could be resolved in a specific
agreement similar to that for land use, land-use change and
forestry (LULUCF) activities. As with biological sinks, there
will be legal issues as well as concerns about permanence and
economic leakage, or emissions outside a system boundary. At
the same time, CCS could involve a rather less complex debate
because of the geological time scales involved. Moreover,
Haefeli et al. (2004) noted that guidelines on how to account for
CO, transfers between countries would need to be agreed either
under the UNFCCC or the Kyoto Protocol. Special attention
would need to be given to CO, exchange between an Annex I
country and a non-Annex I country, and between an Annex I
country party to the Kyoto Protocol and an Annex I country that
has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol.

The physical state of CO, varies with temperature and pressure
as shown in Figure AI.1 — at low temperatures CO, is a solid; on
warming, if the pressure is below 5.1 bar, the solid will sublime
directly into the vapour state. At intermediate temperatures
(between —56.5°C, the temperature of the triple point, and
31.1°C, the critical point), CO, may be turned from a vapour
into a liquid by compressing it to the corresponding liquefaction

The effect on water ionization of an increase in pressure from

Figure AI.8 shows the dependence of pH on the extent
to which CO, dissolves in sea water at temperatures of 0°C
and 25°C based on theoretical calculations (IEA Greenhouse
Gas R&D Programme, 2000) by iterative solution of the
relationships (Horne, 1969) for the carbonic acid/bicarbonate/
carbonate equilibria combined with activity coefficients for the
bicarbonate and carbonate ions in sea water. The temperature
dependence of the ionization of water and the bicarbonate
equilibria were also included in this calculation. This gives
values for the pH of typical sea water of 7.8-8.1 at 25°C and
8.1—8.4 at 0°C. These values, which are strongly dependent on
carbonate/bicarbonate buffering, are in line with typical data
for sea water (Figure AI.8 shows 2 experimental data points
reported by Nishikawa et al., 1992).

elevated concentrations of CO,, such as in re-breathing masks

(Benson et al., 2002). Increased activity or temperature may
affect how the exposure is perceived. Longer exposure, even
to less than 1% concentration, may significantly affect health.
Noticeable effects occur above this level, particularly changes

Food and Beverage

- CO, is used in the food business in three main areas:
Carbonation of beverages; packaging of foodstuffs
and as cryogenic fluid in chilling or freezing
operations or as dry ice for temperature control
during the distribution of foodstuffs.

Health care

- Intra-abdominal insufflation during medical
procedures to expand the space around organs or
tissues for better visualization.

Metals industry

- CO, is typically used for environmental protection;
for example for red fume suppression during scrap
and carbon charging of furnaces, for nitrogen pick-up
reduction during tapping of electric arc furnaces and
for bottom stirring.

- In non-ferrous metallurgy, carbon dioxide is used for
fume suppression during ladle transfer of matte (Cu/
Ni production) or bullion (Zn/Pb production).

During the past 600 million years, the remains of incompletely
decayed plant have become buried under thick layers of rock
and, under high pressure and temperature, have been converted
to petroleum which may occur in gaseous, liquid or solid form.
The fluid produced from petroleum reservoirs may be crude oil
(a mixture of light and heavy hydrocarbons and bitumen) or
natural gas liquids. Hydrocarbons can also be extracted from
tar sands or oil shales; this takes place in several parts of the

Natural gas is combustible gas that occurs in porous rock of
the Earth’s crust; it is often found with or near accumulations
of crude oil. It may occur in separate reservoirs but, more
commonly, it forms a gas cap entrapped between the petroleum
and an impervious, capping rock layer in a petroleum reservoir.
Under high-pressure conditions, it becomes partially mixed
with or dissolved in the crude oil. Methane (CH,) is the main
component of natural gas, usually making up more than 80%
of the constituents by volume. The remaining constituents
are ethane (C,H,), propane (C,H,), butane (C,H,,), hydrogen
sulphide (H,S) and inerts (N,, CO, and He). The amounts of

Fuels are extracted from crude oil through fractional
distillation, with subsequent conversion and upgrading. Such
fuels are used for vehicles (gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel and
liquefied petroleum gases (LPG)), heating oils, lighting oils,
solvents, lubricants and building materials such as asphalts, plus
a variety of other products. The compositions of heating fuels
may differ in their composition, density, etcetera but general
categories are recognized worldwide: kerosene-type vaporizing
fuel, distillate (or ‘gas oil’) and more viscous blends and
residuals. Tables AI.8 and AI.9 provide typical specifications
of some common fuels (Perry and Green, 1997; Kaantee et al.,

Carpenter (1988) describes the various coal classification
systems in use today. In general, these systems are based on
hierarchy and rank. The rank of a coal is the stage the coal has
reached during the coalification’ process — that is its degree of
metamorphism or maturity. Table AI.7 shows the classification
system adopted by the American Society for Testing Materials
(ASTM), D388-92A (Carpenter, 1988; Perry and Green, 1997).
This rank-based system is extensively used in North America
and many other parts of the world. This system uses two
parameters to classify coals by rank, fixed carbon (dry, mineral-
matter-free) for the higher rank coals and gross calorific value
(moist, mineral-matter-free) for the lower rank coals. The
agglomerating character of the coals is used to differentiate
between adjacent coal groups.

"Depending on the fuel type and application, the utilization of
carbonaceous fuels causes direct and indirect emissions of one
or more of the following: SO,, NO,, particulate matter, trace
metals and elements, volatile organic carbons and greenhouse
gases (e.g., CO,, CH,, N,O). Direct emissions are usually
confined to the point of combustion of the fuel. Indirect
emissions include those that arise from the upstream recovery,
processing and distribution of the fuel. Life cycle analysis
(LCA) can be used to account for all emissions (direct as well
as indirect) arising from the recovery, processing, distribution
and end-use of a fuel. Table AI.12 (Cameron, 2002) and Table
AL13 (EPA, 2004) give an idea of some direct and indirect
emissions anticipated, but these should only be viewed as
examples due to the considerable variation there can be in many
of these values.

Biofuels may be defined as fuels produced from organic matter
or combustible oils produced by plants (IPCC, 2001). Dedicated
energy crops, including short-rotation woody crops such as
hardwood trees and herbaceous crops such as switch grass, are
agricultural crops that are solely grown for use as biofuels. These
crops have very fast growth rates and can therefore provide a
regular supply of fuel. The category of biofuels also includes
wood from trees and wood waste products (e.g., sawdust,
wood chips, etc.), crop residues (e.g., rice husks, bagasse, corn
husks, wheat chaff, etc.). This category of fuel is often taken to
include some types of municipal, animal and industrial wastes
(e.g., sewage sludge, manure, etc.). These would be combusted
in stationary plants. Chemical properties of typical biofuels,
including peat, are given in Table AI.11 (Sami ef al., 2001;
Hower, 2003).
