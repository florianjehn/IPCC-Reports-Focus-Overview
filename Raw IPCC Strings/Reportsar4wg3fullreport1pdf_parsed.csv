After two scoping meetings to establish possible content, the formal
assessment production process got underway in 2003 with the approval
of the report outline by the IPCC at the Panel’s 21st session. Soon
after this, an author team of 168 lead authors (55 from developing
countries, 5 from EIT countries and 108 from OECD countries)
and 85 contributing authors was formed by the Working Group III
Bureau, based on nominations from governments and international
organisations. Thirty-six per cent of the lead authors came from
developing countries and countries with economies in transition. The
IPCC review procedure was followed, in which drafts produced by the
authors were subject to two reviews. Thousands of comments from
a total of 485 expert reviewers, and governments and international
organisations were processed. The processing into new drafts was
overseen by two review editors per chapter, who ensured that all
substantive comments received appropriate consideration.

"A description of mitigation options for the various societal sectors that
contribute to emissions forms the core of this report. Seven chapters
cover mitigation options in energy supply, transport, buildings, industry,
agriculture, forestry and waste management, with one additional
chapter dealing with the cross-sectoral issues. The authors have
provided the reader with an up-to-date overview of the characteristics
of the various sectors, the mitigation measures that could be employed,
the costs and specific barriers, and the policy implementation issues.
In addition, estimates are given of the overall mitigation potential and
costs per sector, and for the world as a whole. The report combines
information from bottom-up technological studies with results of top-
down modelling exercises. Mitigation measures for the short term are
placed in the long-term perspective of realising stabilisation of global
average temperatures. This provides policy-relevant information on
the relation between the stringency of stabilisation targets and the
timing and amount of mitigation necessary. Policies and measures to
achieve mitigation action, both at national and international levels, are
covered in chapter 13; this is additional to what is included in the sector
chapters. The link between climate change mitigation, adaptation and
sustainable development has been further elaborated in the relevant
chapters of the report, with one chapter presenting an overview of the
connections between sustainable development and climate change
mitigation.

"Each headline statement has an “agreement/evidence” assessment attached that is supported by the bullets underneath. This does not necessarily mean that this level of
“agreement/evidence” applies to each bullet. Endbox 1 provides an explanation of this representation of uncertainty.

The definition of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO,-eq) is the amount of CO2 emission that would cause the same radiative forcing as an emitted amount of a well mixed green-
house gas or a mixture of well mixed greenhouse gases, all multiplied with their respective GWPs to take into account the differing times they remain in the atmosphere [WGI
AR4 Glossary].

Direct emissions in each sector do not include emissions from the electricity sector for the electricity consumed in the building, industry and agricultural sectors or of the
emissions from refinery operations supplying fuel to the transport sector.

The term “land use, land use change and forestry” is used here to describe the aggregated emissions of CO,, CH,, NO from deforestation, biomass and burning, decay of
biomass from logging and deforestation, decay of peat and peat fires [1.3.1]. This is broader than emissions from deforestation, which is included as a subset. The emissions
reported here do not include carbon uptake (removals).

This trend is for the total LULUCF emissions, of which emissions from deforestation are a subset and, owing to large data uncertainties, is significantly less certain than for other
sectors. The rate of deforestation globally was slightly lower in the 2000-2005 period than in the 1990-2000 period [9.2.1].

The GDPppp metric is used for illustrative purposes only for this report. For an explanation of PPP and Market Exchange Rate (MER) GDP calculations, see footnote 12.

The Working Group III contribution to the IPCC Fourth
Assessment Report (AR4) focuses on new literature on
the scientific, technological, environmental, economic and
social aspects of mitigation of climate change, published
since the IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR) and the
Special Reports on CO, Capture and Storage (SRCCS) and
on Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate
System (SROC).

The following summary is organised into six sections after

this introduction:

e Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission trends

e Mitigation in the short and medium term, across
different economic sectors (until 2030)

e Mitigation in the long-term (beyond 2030)

e Policies, measures and instruments to mitigate climate

"between 1990 and 2004), from 28.7 to 49 Gigatonnes
of carbon dioxide equivalents (GtCO,-eq)* (see Figure
SPM.1). The emissions of these gases have increased
at different rates. CO, emissions have grown between
1970 and 2004 by about 80% (28% between 1990 and
2004) and represented 77% of total anthropogenic GHG
emissions in 2004.

The largest growth in global GHG emissions between
1970 and 2004 has come from the energy supply sector
(an increase of 145%). The growth in direct emissions?
from transport in this period was 120%, industry 65%
and land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF)*
40%°. Between 1970 and 1990 direct emissions from
agriculture grew by 27% and from buildings by 26%,
and the latter remained at approximately at 1990 levels
thereafter. However, the buildings sector has a high level
of electricity use and hence the total of direct and indirect
emissions in this sector is much higher (75%) than direct
emissions [1.3, 6.1, 11.3, Figures 1.1 and 1.3].

The effect on global emissions of the decrease in global
energy intensity (-33%) during 1970 to 2004 has been
smaller than the combined effect of global per capita
income growth (77 %) and global population growth
(69%); both drivers of increasing energy-related CO,
emissions (Figure SPM.2). The long-term trend of a
declining carbon intensity of energy supply reversed
after 2000. Differences in terms of per capita income, per
capita emissions, and energy intensity among countries
remain significant. (Figure SPM.3). In 2004 UNFCCC
Annex I countries held a 20% share in world population,
produced 57% of world Gross Domestic Product based
on Purchasing Power Parity (GDP.,,,,)° and accounted for
46% of global GHG emissions (Figure SPM.3) [1.3].
The emissions of ozone depleting substances (ODS)
controlled under the Montreal Protocol’, which are also
GHGs, have declined significantly since the 1990s. By
2004 the emissions of these gases were about 20% of
their 1990 level [1.3].

A range of policies, including those on climate change,
energy security’, and sustainable development, have
been effective in reducing GHG emissions in different
sectors and many countries. The scale of such measures,
however, has not yet been large enough to counteract
the global growth in emissions [1.3, 12.2].

9 The SRES 2000 GHG emissions assumed here are 39.8 GtCO2-eq, i.e. lower than the emissions reported in the EDGAR database for 2000 (45 GtCO2-eq). This is mostly due to
differences in LULUCF emissions.

"With current climate change mitigation policies and
related sustainable development practices, global
GHG emissions will continue to grow over the next few
decades (high agreement, much evidence).

The SRES (non-mitigation) scenarios project an increase
of baseline global GHG emissions by a range of 9.7
GtCO,-eq to 36.7 GtCO,-eq (25-90%) between 2000
and 20309 (Box SPM.1 and Figure SPM.4). In these
scenarios, fossil fuels are projected to maintain their
dominant position in the global energy mix to 2030 and
beyond. Hence CO, emissions between 2000 and 2030
from energy use are projected to grow 40 to 110% over
that period. Two thirds to three quarters of this increase
in energy CO, emissions is projected to come from non-
Annex I regions, with their average per capita energy
CO, emissions being projected to remain substantially
lower (2.8-5.1 tCO,/cap) than those in Annex I regions
(9.6-15.1 tCO,/cap) by 2030. According to SRES
scenarios, their economies are projected to have a lower
energy use per unit of GDP (6.2 — 9.9 MJ/US$ GDP)
than that of non-Annex I countries (11.0 — 21.6 MJ/US$
GDP). [1.3, 3.2]

the projected emissions, when used consistently!2.

uncertainties caused by assumptions on other parameters

for those studies incorporating these new population

growth, resulted in little change in overall emission

The ranges for global economic potentials as assessed in each sector are shown by vertical lines. The ranges are based on end-use allocations of emissions,
meaning that emissions of electricity use are counted towards the end-use sectors and not to the energy supply sector.

The estimated potentials have been constrained by the availability of studies particularly at high carbon price levels.

Sectors used different baselines. For industry the SRES B2 baseline was taken, for energy supply and transport the WEO 2004 baseline was used; the building
sector is based on a baseline in between SRES B2 and A1B; for waste, SRES A1B driving forces were used to construct a waste specific baseline, agriculture and
forestry used baselines that mostly used B2 driving forces.

. Only global totals for transport are shown because international aviation is included [5.4].
. Categories excluded are: non-CO, emissions in buildings and transport, part of material efficiency options, heat production and cogeneration in energy supply,

heavy duty vehicles, shipping and high-occupancy passenger transport, most high-cost options for buildings, wastewater treatment, emission reduction from coal
mines and gas pipelines, fluorinated gases from energy supply and transport. The underestimation of the total economic potential from these emissions is of the
order of 10-15%.

"Studies that assume the possibility that climate change
policy induces enhanced technological change also
give lower costs. However, this may require higher
upfront investment in order to achieve costs reductions
thereafter (see Box SPM.4) [3.3, 3.4, 11.4, 11.5, 11.6].

Although most models show GDP losses, some show
GDP gains because they assume that baselines are
non-optimal and mitigation policies improve market
efficiencies, or they assume that more technological
change may be induced by mitigation policies. Examples
of market inefficiencies include unemployed resources,
distortionary taxes and/or subsidies [3.3, 11.4].

A multi-gas approach and inclusion of carbon sinks
generally reduces costs substantially compared to CO,
emission abatement only [3.3].

Regional costs are largely dependent on the assumed
stabilization level and baseline scenario. The allocation
regime is also important, but for most countries to a
lesser extent than the stabilization level [11.4, 13.3].

a low-carbon economy that is both equitable and
sustainable [4.1, 6.7].

Education and training programmes can help overcome

Changes in occupant behaviour, cultural patterns and

Transport Demand Management, which includes urban

sector!9, but their effect may be counteracted by growth
in the sector. Mitigation options are faced with many
barriers, such as consumer preferences and lack of policy
frameworks (medium agreement, medium evidence).

e Improved vehicle efficiency measures, leading to fuel
savings, in many cases have net benefits (at least for
light-duty vehicles), but the market potential is much
lower than the economic potential due to the influence
of other consumer considerations, such as performance
and size. There is not enough information to assess the
mitigation potential for heavy-duty vehicles. Market
forces alone, including rising fuel costs, are therefore
not expected to lead to significant emission reductions
[5.3, 5.4].

e Biofuels might play an important role in addressing
GHG emissions in the transport sector, depending on
their production pathway. Biofuels used as gasoline and
diesel fuel additives/substitutes are projected to grow to
3% of total transport energy demand in the baseline in
2030. This could increase to about 5-10%, depending on
future oil and carbon prices, improvements in vehicle
efficiency and the success of technologies to utilise
cellulose biomass [5.3, 5.4].

¢ Modal shifts from road to rail and to inland and
coastal shipping and from low-occupancy to high-
occupancy passenger transportation?2, as well as land-
use, urban planning and non-motorized transport offer
opportunities for GHG mitigation, depending on local
conditions and policies [5.3, 5.5].

e Medium term mitigation potential for CO, emissions
from the aviation sector can come from improved fuel
efficiency, which can be achieved through a variety
of means, including technology, operations and air
traffic management. However, such improvements are
expected to only partially offset the growth of aviation
emissions. Total mitigation potential in the sector would
also need to account for non-CO, climate impacts of
aviation emissions [5.3, 5.4].

Future energy infrastructure investment decisions,
expected to total over 20 trillion US$?° between now and
2030, will have long term impacts on GHG emissions,
because of the long life-times of energy plants and other
infrastructure capital stock. The widespread diffusion of
low-carbon technologies may take many decades, even
if early investments in these technologies are made
attractive. Initial estimates show that returning global
energy-related CO, emissions to 2005 levels by 2030
would require a large shift in the pattern of investment,
although the net additional investment required ranges
from negligible to 5-10% [4.1, 4.4, 11.6].

It is often more cost-effective to invest in end-use
energy efficiency improvement than in increasing
energy supply to satisfy demand for energy services.
Efficiency improvement has a positive effect on energy
security, local and regional air pollution abatement, and
employment [4.2, 4.3, 6.5, 7.7, 11.3, 11.8].

Renewable energy generally has a positive effect
on energy security, employment and on air quality.
Given costs relative to other supply options, renewable
electricity, which accounted for 18% of the electricity
supply in 2005, can have a 30-35% share of the total
electricity supply in 2030 at carbon prices up to 50
US$/tCO,-eq [4.3, 4.4, 11.3, 11.6, 11.8].

The higher the market prices of fossil fuels, the more
low-carbon alternatives will be competitive, although
price volatility will be a disincentive for investors.
Higher priced conventional oil resources, on the other
hand, may be replaced by high carbon alternatives such
as from oil sands, oil shales, heavy oils, and synthetic
fuels from coal and gas, leading to increasing GHG
emissions, unless production plants are equipped with
CCS [4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5].

Given costs relative to other supply options, nuclear
power, which accounted for 16% of the electricity supply
in 2005, can have an 18% share of the total electricity
supply in 2030 at carbon prices up to 50 US$/tCO,-eq,
but safety, weapons proliferation and waste remain as
constraints [4.2, 4.3, 4.4]2!.

CCS in underground geological formations is a new

for bioenergy from transport and energy supply, on
water availability, and on requirements of land for food

expected to increase the fraction of anthropogenic emissions that remains in the atmosphere as the climate system warms. Therefore, the emission reductions to
meet a particular stabilization level reported in the mitigation studies assessed here might be underestimated.

b) The best estimate of climate sensitivity is 3°C [WG 1 SPM].

"Integrated assessment of the economic costs and
benefits of different mitigation pathways shows that the
economically optimal timing and level of mitigation
depends upon the uncertain shape and character of the
assumed climate change damage cost curve. To illustrate
this dependency:

o if the climate change damage cost curve grows
slowly and regularly, and there is good foresight
(which increases the potential for timely adaptation),
later and less stringent mitigation is economically
justified;

o alternatively if the damage cost curve increases
steeply, or contains non-linearities (e.g. vulnerability
thresholds or even small probabilities of catastrophic
events), earlier and more stringent mitigation is
economically justified [3.6].

Climate sensitivity is a key uncertainty for mitigation

scenarios that aim to meet a specific temperature level.

Studies show that if climate sensitivity is high then

the timing and level of mitigation is earlier and more

stringent than when it is low [3.5, 3.6].

Delayed emission reductions lead to investments that

lock in more emission-intensive infrastructure and

development pathways. This significantly constrains
the opportunities to achieve lower stabilization levels

(as shown in Table SPM.5) and increases the risk of

more severe climate change impacts [3.4, 3.1, 3.5, 3.6]

An effective carbon-price signal could realize significant
mitigation potential in all sectors [11.3, 13.2].
Modelling studies, consistent with stabilization at
around 550 ppm CO,-eq by 2100 (see Box SPM.3),
show carbon prices rising to 20 to 80 US$/tCO,-eq
by 2030 and 30 to 155 US$/tCO,-eq by 2050. For the
same stabilization level, studies since TAR that take
into account induced technological change lower these
price ranges to 5 to 65 US$/tCO,-eq in 2030 and 15 to
130 US$/tCO,-eq in 2050 [3.3, 11.4, 11.5].

Most top-down, as well as some 2050 bottom-up
assessments, suggest that real or implicit carbon prices
of 20 to 50 US$/tCO,-eq, sustained or increased over
decades, could lead to a power generation sector with
low-GHG emissions by 2050 and make many mitigation
options in the end-use sectors economically

attractive. [4.4,11.6]

Barriers to the implementation of mitigation options

policies makes implementation and overcoming

0 Regulations and standards generally provide some
certainty about emission levels. They may be
preferable to other instruments when information
or other barriers prevent producers and consumers
from responding to price signals. However, they
may not induce innovations and more advanced
technologies.

o axes and charges can set a price for carbon, but
cannot guarantee a particular level of emissions.
Literature identifies taxes as an efficient way of
internalizing costs of GHG emissions.

o Tradable permits will establish a carbon price.
The volume of allowed emissions determines their
environmental effectiveness, while the allocation of
permits has distributional consequences. Fluctuation
in the price of carbon makes it difficult to estimate
the total cost of complying with emission permits.

0 Financial incentives (subsidies and tax credits) are

While economic costs are generally higher than for
the instruments listed above, they are often critical

Irrespective of the scale of mitigation measures,
adaptation measures are necessary [1.2].

Addressing climate change can be considered an
integral element of sustainable development policies.
National circumstances and the strengths of institutions

the interactions of public and private decision processes
involving government, business and civil society, many
of which are not traditionally considered as climate

Notable achievements of the UNFCCC and its Kyoto
Protocol are the establishment of a global response to
the climate problem, stimulation of an array of
national policies, the creation of an international carbon
market and the establishment of new institutional
mechanisms that may provide the foundation for future
mitigation efforts (high agreement, much evidence).

e The impact of the Protocol’s first commitment period
relative to global emissions is projected to be limited. Its
economic impacts on participating Annex-B countries
are projected to be smaller than presented in TAR, that
showed 0.2-2% lower GDP in 2012 without emissions
trading, and 0.1-1.1% lower GDP with emissions

reductions of global GHG emissions at the international

level through cooperation. It also suggests that successful
agreements are environmentally effective, cost-effective,

considerations and equity, and are institutionally

feasible (high agreement, much evidence).

[13.3].

"climate policy, can significantly reduce emissions. On
the other hand, decisions about improving rural access
to modern energy sources for example may not have
much influence on global GHG emissions [12.2].
Climate change policies related to energy efficiency
and renewable energy are often economically
beneficial, improve energy security and reduce local
pollutant emissions. Other energy supply mitigation
options can be designed to also achieve sustainable
development benefits such as avoided displacement
of local populations, job creation, and health benefits
[4.5,12.3].

Reducing both loss of natural habitat and deforestation
can have significant biodiversity, soil and water
conservation benefits, and can be implemented in
a socially and economically sustainable manner.
Forestation and bioenergy plantations can lead to
restoration of degraded land, manage water runoff,
retain soil carbon and benefit rural economies, but
could compete with land for food production and may
be negative for biodiversity, if not properly designed
(9.7, 12.3].

There are also good possibilities for reinforcing
sustainable development through mitigation actions in
the waste management, transportation and buildings
sectors [5.4, 6.6, 10.5, 12.3].

Making development more sustainable can enhance both
mitigative and adaptive capacity, and reduce emissions
and vulnerability to climate change. Synergies between
mitigation and adaptation can exist, for example
properly designed biomass production, formation

buildings and forestry. In other situations, there may
be trade-offs, such as increased GHG emissions due
to increased consumption of energy related to adaptive

"The main aim of this report is to assess options for
mitigating climate change. Several aspects link climate change
with development issues. This report explores these links in
detail, and illustrates where climate change and sustainable
development are mutually reinforcing.

"Considerable uncertainties still surround the estimates of
anthropogenic aerosol emissions. As regards global sulphur
emissions, these appear to have declined from 75 + 10 MtS in
1990 to 55-62 MtS in 2000. Data on non-sulphur aerosols are
sparse and highly speculative. (medium agreement, medium
evidence).

"Economic development needs, resource endowments and
mitigative and adaptive capacities differ across regions. There
is no one-size-fits-all approach to the climate change problem,
and solutions need to be regionally differentiated to reflect
different socio-economic conditions and, to a lesser extent,
geographical differences. Although this report has a global
focus, an attempt is made to differentiate the assessment of
scientific and technical findings for the various regions.
"	Text
"Given that mitigation options vary significantly between
economic sectors, it was decided to use the economic sectors
to organize the material on short- to medium-term mitigation
options. Contrary to what was done in the Third Assessment
Report, all relevant aspects of sectoral mitigation options,
such as technology, cost, policies etc., are discussed together,
to provide the user with a comprehensive discussion of the
sectoral mitigation options.

"Atmospheric CO, concentrations have increased by almost
100 ppm since their pre-industrial level, reaching 379 ppm in
2005, with mean annual growth rates in the 2000-2005 period
higher than in the 1990s. The total CO -equivalent (CO,-eq)
concentration of all long-lived GHGs is now about 455 ppm
CO,-eq. Incorporating the cooling effect of aerosols, other air
pollutants and gases released from land-use change into the
equivalent concentration, leads to an effective 311-435 ppm
CO,-eq concentration (high agreement, much evidence).

"In 2004, energy supply accounted for about 26% of GHG
emissions, industry 19%, gases released from land-use change
and forestry 17%, agriculture 14%, transport 13%, residential,
commercial and service sectors 8% and waste 3% (see Figure
TS.2). These figures should be seen as indicative, as some
uncertainty remains, particularly with regards to CH, and N,O
emissions (error margin estimated to be in the order of 30-50%)
and CO, emissions from agriculture and forestry with an even
higher error margin (high agreement, medium evidence) [1.3].

"Emissions of the GHGs covered by the Kyoto Protocol
increased by about 70% (from 28.7 to. 49.0 GtCO,-eq) from
1970-2004 (by 24% from 1990-2004), with carbon dioxide
(CO ) being the largest source, having grown by about 80% (see
Figure TS. 1). The largest growth in CO, emissions has come from
power generation and road transport. Methane (CH,) emissions
rose by about 40% from 1970, with an 85% increase from the
combustion and use of fossil fuels. Agriculture, however, is the
largest source of CH, emissions. Nitrous oxide (N,O) emissions
grew by about 50%, due mainly to increased use of fertilizer
and the growth of agriculture. Industrial emission of N,O fell
during this period (high agreement, much evidence) [1.3].

"Emissions of ozone-depleting substances (ODS) controlled
under the Montreal Protocol (which includes GHGs
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons
(HCFCs)), increased from a low level in 1970 to about
7.5 GtCO,-eq in 1990 (about 20% of total GHG emissions,
not shown in the Figure TS.1), but then decreased to about
1.5 GtCO -eq in 2004, and are projected to decrease further due
to the phase-out of CFCs in developing countries. Emissions
of the fluorinated gases (F-gases) (hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs),
perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and SF.) controlled under the Kyoto
Protocol grew rapidly (primarily HFCs) during the 1990s as
they replaced ODS to a substantial extent and were estimated
at about 0.5 GtCO,eq in 2004 (about 1.1% of total emissions
on a 100-year global warming potential (GWP) basis) (high
agreement, much evidence) [1.3].

"Consequently, the report has four parts. Part A (Chapters |
and 2) includes the introduction and sets out the frameworks
to describe mitigation of climate change in the context of other
policies and decision-making. It introduces important concepts
(e.g., risk and uncertainty, mitigation and adaptation relationships,
distributional and equity aspects and regional integration) and
defines important terms used throughout the report. Part B
(Chapter 3) assesses long-term stabilization targets, how to get
there and what the associated costs are, by examining mitigation
scenarios for ranges of stability targets. The relation between
adaptation, mitigation and climate change damage avoided is also
discussed, in the light of decision-making regarding stabilization
(Art. 2 UNFCCC). Part C (Chapters 4-10) focuses on the detailed
description of the various sectors responsible for greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions, the short- to medium-term mitigation options
and costs in these sectors, the policies for achieving mitigation,
the barriers to getting there and the relationship with adaptation
and other policies that affect GHG emissions. Part D (Chapters
11-13) assesses cross-sectoral issues, sustainable development
and national and international aspects. Chapter 11 covers the
aggregated mitigation potential, macro-economic impacts,
technology development and transfer, synergies, and trade-offs
with other policies and cross-border influences (or spill-over
effects). Chapter 12 links climate mitigation with sustainable
development. Chapter 13 assesses domestic climate policies
and various forms of international cooperation. This Technical
Summary has an additional Chapter 14, which deals with gaps
in knowledge.

2 SRES refers to scenarios described in the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (IPCC, 2000b). The A1 family of scenarios describes a future with very rapid economic growth,
low population growth and rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies. B1 describes a convergent world, with the same global population that peaks in mid century
and declines thereafter, with rapid changes in economic structures. B2 describes a world ‘in which emphasis is on local solutions to economic, social, and environmental sustain-
ability’. It features moderate population growth. intermediate levels of economic development. and less rapid and more diverse technological change than the A1B scenario.

Decisions made in relation to Article 2 would determine the
level of climate change that is set as the goal for policy, and have
fundamental implications for emission-reduction pathways as
well as the scale of adaptation required. Choosing a stabilization
level implies balancing the risks of climate change (from
gradual change and extreme events, and irreversible change of
the climate, including those to food security, ecosystems and
sustainable development) against the risks of response measures
that may threaten economic sustainability. Although any
judgment on ‘dangerous interference’ is necessarily a social and
political one, depending on the level of risk deemed acceptable,
large emission reductions are unavoidable if stabilization is to
be achieved. The lower the stabilization level, the earlier these
large reductions have to be realized (high agreement, much

The entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol marks a first, though
modest, step towards achieving the ultimate objective of the

signatories, however, would still be far from reversing overall
global GHG-emission trends. The strengths of the Kyoto

Adaptation and mitigation are two types of policy response
to climate change, which can be complementary, substitutable
or independent of each other. Irrespective of the scale of
mitigation measures, adaptation measures will be required
anyway, due to the inertia in the climate system. Over the next
20 years or so, even the most aggressive climate policy can
do little to avoid warming already ‘loaded’ into the climate
system. The benefits of avoided climate change will only accrue
beyond that time. Over longer time frames, beyond the next
few decades, mitigation investments have a greater potential to
avoid climate change damage and this potential is larger than
the adaptation options that can currently be envisaged (medium

transactions, which are influenced by government policies,
private sector initiatives and by the preferences and choices of
consumers. These include a broad number of policies related
to nature conservation, legal frameworks, property rights, rule
of law, taxes and regulation, production, security and safety of
food, consumption patterns, human and institutional capacity
building efforts, R&D, financial schemes, technology transfer,
energy efficiency and energy options. These policies do not
usually emerge and become implemented as part of a general
development-policy package, but are normally targeted towards
more specific policy goals like air-pollution standards, food
security and health issues, GHG-emission reduction, income
generation by specific groups,or development of industries for
green technologies. However, significant impacts can arise from
such policies on sustainability and greenhouse mitigation and
the outcomes of adaptation. The strong relationship between
mitigation of climate change and development applies in both
developed and developing countries. Chapter 12 and to some

technological change into distinct phases. One is to consider
technological change as roughly a two-part process: 1)
conceiving, creating and developing new technologies or
enhancing existing technologies — advancing the ‘technological
frontier’; 2) the diffusion or deployment of these technologies.
Our understanding of technology and its role in addressing climate
change is improving continuously. The processes by which
technologies are created, developed, deployed and eventually
replaced, however, are complex (see Figure TS.6) and no simple
descriptions of these processes exist. Technology development
and deployment is characterized by two public goods problems.

would result in lower emissions. In the scenarios that use lower
projections, however, changes in other drivers of emissions have
partly offset the consequences of lower populations. Few studies
incorporated lower population projections, but where they did,
they showed that lower population is offset by higher rates of
economic growth, and/or a shift toward a more carbon-intensive
energy system, such as a shift to coal because of increasing oil

The choice of the conversion factor, Market Exchange Rate

type of analysis being undertaken. However, when it comes to
calculating emissions (or other physical measures like energy),
the choice between MER and PPP-based representations of
GDP should not matter, since emission intensity will change (in
a compensating manner) when the GDP numbers change. Thus,
if a consistent set of metrics is employed, the choice of metric
should not appreciably affect the final emission level. A number
of new studies in the literature concur that the actual choice
of exchange rates does not itself have an appreciable effect
on long-term emission projections. In the case of SRES, the
emissions trajectories are the same whether economic activities
in the four scenario families are measured in MER or PPP.

"A commonly used target in the literature is stabilization of
CO, concentrations in the atmosphere. If more than one GHG is
studied, a useful alternative is to formulate aGHG-concentration
target in terms of CO,-equivalent concentration or radiative
forcing, thereby weighting the concentrations of the different
gases by their radiative properties. Another option is to stabilize
or target global mean temperature. The advantage of radiative-
forcing targets over temperature targets is that the calculation
of radiative forcing does not depend on climate sensitivity.
The disadvantage is that a wide range of temperature impacts
is possible for each radiative-forcing level. Temperature
targets, on the other hand, have the important advantage of
being more directly linked to climate change impacts. Another
approach is to calculate the risks or the probability of exceeding
particular values of global annual mean temperature rise since

9 Studies on mitigation portfolios and macro-economic costs assessed in this report are based on a global least-cost approach, with optimal mitigation portfolios and without
allocation of emission allowances to regions. If regions are excluded or non-optimal portfolios are chosen, global costs will go up. The variation in mitigation portfolios and their
costs for a given stabilization level is caused by different assumptions, such as on baselines (lower baselines give lower costs), GHGs and mitigation options considered (more
gases and mitigation options give lower costs), cost curves for mitigation options and rate of technological change.

"Recent stabilization studies have found that land-use
mitigation options (both non-CO, and CO,) provide cost-
effective abatement flexibility in achieving 2100 stabilization
targets. In some scenarios, increased commercial biomass
energy (solid and liquid fuel) is significant in stabilization,
providing 5—30% of cumulative abatement and potentially 10—
25% of total primary energy over the century, especially as a net
negative emissions strategy that combines biomass energy with
CO, capture and storage.

"The costs of stabilization depend on the stabilization target
and level, the baseline and the portfolio of technologies
considered, as well as the rate of technological change. Global
mitigation costs? rise with lower stabilization levels and
with higher baseline emissions. Costs in 2050 for multi-gas
stabilization at 650 ppm CO,-eq (cat IV) are between a 2%
loss or a one procent increase!° of GDP in 2050. For 550 ppm
CO,-eq (cat III) these costs are a range of a very small increase

535 ppm CO,-eq. costs are lower than 5.5% loss of GDP, but

"A risk management or ‘hedging’ approach can assist policy-
makers to advance mitigation decisions in the absence of a long-
term target and in the face of large uncertainties related to the cost
of mitigation, the efficacy of adaptation and the negative impacts
of climate change. The extent and the timing of the desirable
hedging strategy will depend on the stakes, the odds and societies’
attitudes to risks, for example, with respect to risks of abrupt
change in geophysical systems and other key vulnerabilities.
A variety of integrated assessment approaches exist to assess
mitigation benefits in the context of policy decisions related to
such long-term climate goals. There will be ample opportunity
for learning and mid-course corrections as new information
becomes available. However, actions in the short term will
largely determine long-term global mean temperatures and thus
what corresponding climate change impacts can be avoided.
Delayed emission reductions lead to investments that lock in more
emission-intensive infrastructure and development pathways.
This significantly constrains the opportunities to achieve lower
stabilization levels and increases the risk of more severe climate
change impacts. Hence, analysis of near-term decisions should
not be decoupled from analysis that considers long-term climate
change outcomes (high agreement, much evidence) (3.6; 3.5.2].

waste remain as constraints for nuclear power. Hydrogen may
also eventually contribute as an energy carrier with low carbon
emissions, dependent on the source of the hydrogen and the
successful uptake of CCS for hydrogen production from coal
or gas. Renewable energy must either be used in a distributed
manner or will need to be concentrated to meet the intensive
energy demands of cities and industries, because, unlike fossil
fuel sources, the sources of renewable energy are widely
distributed with low energy returns per exploited area (medium

services that are currently being met mainly by fossil fuels.
Increasing access to modern energy services can have multiple
benefits. Their use can help improve air quality, particularly in
large urban areas, and lead to a decrease in GHG emissions.
An estimated 2400 GW of new power plants plus the related
infrastructure will need to be built in developing countries

such large investments provide opportunities for sustainable
development. The integration of development policies with
GHG mitigation objectives can deliver the advantages mentioned

the coming decades. As incomes grow and the value of
travellers’ time increases, travellers are expected to choose
faster modes of transport, shifting from non-motorized to
automotive, to air and high-speed rail. Increasing speed
has generally led to greater energy intensity and higher

The fuel efficiency of civil aviation can be improved
by a variety of means including technology, operation and
management of air traffic. Technology developments might
offer a 20% improvement in fuel efficiency over 1997 levels
by 2015, with a 40-50% improvement likely by 2050. As
civil aviation continues to grow at around 5% each year, such
improvements are unlikely to keep carbon emissions from
global air travel from increasing. The introduction of biofuels
could mitigate some of aviation’s carbon emissions, if biofuels

measures could reduce carbon emissions by 4—20% in older

However, due to the long lifetime of engines, it will take
decades before measures on existing ships are implemented
on a significant scale. The short-term potential for operational

from 140%. The study estimated a maximum reduction of
emissions of the world fleet of about 18% by 2010 and 28% by

Given the positive effects of higher population densities on
public transport use, walking, cycling and CO, emissions, better
integrated spatial planning is an important policy element in the
transportation sector. There are some good examples for large
cities in several countries. Transportation Demand Management
(TDM) can be effective in reducing private vehicle travel if
rigorously implemented and supported. Soft measures, such
as the provision of information and the use of communication
strategies and educational techniques have encouraged a
change in personal behaviour leading to a reduction in the
use of the car by 14% in an Australian city, 12% in a German
city and 13% in a Swedish city (medium agreement, medium

"Taxes on vehicle purchase, registration, use and motor fuels,

determinants of vehicle-energy use and GHG emissions. They

control congestion of public roads. An important reason for fuel
or CO, tax having limited effects is that price elasticities tend to
be substantially smaller than the income elasticities of demand.
In the long run, the income elasticity of demand is a factor
1.5—3 higher than the price elasticity of total transport demand,
meaning that price signals become less effective with increasing
incomes. Rebates on vehicle purchase and registration taxes for
fuel-efficient vehicles have been shown to be effective. Road

widely, from uniform, mandatory corporate average standards,

"Historically, the industrial sector has achieved reductions
in energy intensity and emission intensity through adoption
of energy efficiency and specific mitigation technologies,
particularly in energy-intensive industries. The aluminium
industry reported >70% reduction in PFC-emission intensity over
the period 1990-2004 and the ammonia industry reported that

"Full use of available mitigation options is not being made in

world, GHG mitigation is not demanded by either the market

in GHG mitigation to the extent that other factors provide a
return for their investments. This return can be economic; for
example, energy-efficiency projects that provide an economic
pay-out, or can be in terms of achieving larger corporate goals,
for example, a commitment to sustainable development. The
economic potential as outlined above will only be realized if

is that, as noted above, most energy-intensive industries are
located in developing countries. Slow rate of capital stock

"Several national, regional or sectoral CO, emissions
trading systems either exist or are being developed. The
further refinement of these trading systems could be informed
by evidence that suggests that in some important aspects,
participants from industrial sectors face a significantly different
situation to those from the electricity sector. For instance,
responses to carbon emission price in industry tend to be slower
because of the more limited technology portfolio and absence
of short-term fuel-switching possibilities, making predictable
allocation mechanisms and stable price signals a more important
issue for industry [7.9.4].

"Policies aimed at balancing energy security, environmental
protection and economic development can have a positive

policies focusing on energy efficiency, dematerialization, and
use of renewables support GHG mitigation objectives. Waste-
management policies reduce industrial sector GHG emissions
by reducing energy use through the re-use of products. Air-
pollutant reduction measures can have synergy with GHG-
emissions reduction when reduction is achieved by shifting to
low-carbon fuels, but do not always reduce GHG emissions as
many require the use of additional energy.

"Policies that reduce the barriers to adoption of cost-effective,
low-GHG emission technologies (e.g., lack of information,
absence of standards and unavailability of affordable financing
for first purchases of modern technology) can be effective.
Many countries, both developed and developing, have financial
schemes available to promote energy saving in industry.
According to a World Energy Council survey, 28 countries
provide some sort of grant or subsidy for industrial energy-
efficiency projects. Fiscal measures are also frequently used to
stimulate energy savings in industry. However, a drawback to
financial incentives is that they are often also used by investors
who would have made the investment without the incentive.
Possible solutions to improve cost-effectiveness are to restrict
schemes to specific target groups and/or techniques (selected
lists of equipment, only innovative technologies), or use a direct
criterion of cost-effectiveness [7.9.3].

"In addition to implementing the mitigation options discussed
above, achieving sustainable development will require
industrial development pathways that minimize the need for
future mitigation (high agreement, medium evidence). Large
companies have greater resources, and usually more incentives,
to factor environmental and social considerations into their
operations than small and medium enterprises (SMEs), but
SMEs provide the bulk of employment and manufacturing
capacity in many countries. Integrating SME development
strategy into broader national strategies for development is
consistent with sustainable development objectives. Energy-

"Voluntary agreements between industry and government to
reduce energy use and GHG emissions have been used since
the early 1990s. Well-designed agreements, which set realistic
targets and have sufficient government support, often as part
of a larger environmental policy package, and a real threat
of increased government regulation or energy/GHG taxes
if targets are not achieved, can provide more than business-
as-usual energy savings or emission reductions. Some have
accelerated the application of best available technology and
led to reductions in emissions compared with the baseline,
particularly in countries with traditions of close cooperation
between government and industry. However, the majority of
voluntary agreements have not achieved significant emission
reductions beyond business-as-usual. Corporations, sub-
national governments, non-government organizations (NGOs)
and civil groups are adopting a wide variety of voluntary actions,
independent of government authorities, which may limit GHG
emissions, stimulate innovative policies, and encourage the
deployment of new technologies. By themselves, however, they

Industrial technology research, development, deployment and

Some rural development policies undertaken to fight poverty,

also increase carbon sequestration. In many regions,
agricultural mitigation options are influenced most by
non-climate policies, including macro-economic, agricultural

dispersed and viable populations of individual species minimizes
the probability of localized catastrophic events causing species
extinction. Formation of protected areas or nature reserves is an

activities will help increase the carbon sink, with the net
balance depending on the region. Boreal primary forests will
either be small sources or sinks depending on the net effect of
enhancement of growth versus a loss of soil organic matter and
emissions from increased fires. Temperate forests will probably
continue to be net carbon sinks, favoured also by enhanced
forest growth due to climate change. In the tropical regions,
human-induced land-use changes are expected to continue to
drive the dynamics for decades. Beyond 2040, depending very

constitutes a significant renewable energy resource that can
be exploited through thermal processes (incineration and
industrial co-combustion), landfill gas utilization and use of
anaerobic digester biogas. Waste has an economic advantage in
comparison to many biomass resources because it is regularly
collected at public expense. The energy content of waste can
be most efficiently exploited using thermal processes: during
combustion, energy is obtained directly from biomass (paper
products, wood, natural textiles, food) and from fossil carbon
sources (plastics, synthetic textiles). Assuming an average
heating value of 9GJ/t, global waste contains >8 EJ of
available energy, which could increase to 13 EJ (nearly 2% of

"Recycling, re-use and waste minimization initiatives, both
public and private, are indirectly reducing GHG emissions by
decreasing the mass of waste requiring disposal. Depending on
regulations, policies, markets, economic priorities and local

higher recycling rates to conserve resources, offset fossil fuel
use, and avoid GHG generation. Quantification of global
recycling rates is not currently possible because of varying
baselines and definitions; however, local reductions of >50%
have been achieved. Recycling could be expanded practically in
many countries to achieve additional reductions. In developing

practices. Through various diversion and small-scale recycling
activities, those who make their living from decentralized waste
management can significantly reduce the mass of waste that
requires more centralized solutions. Studies indicate that low-

as-usual (BAU) projections indicate that landfill CH, will

emissions are stabilizing and decreasing in many developed
countries as a result of increased landfill gas recovery combined
with waste diversion from landfills through recycling, waste
minimization and alternative thermal and biological waste

"Because of landhll gas recovery and complementary
measures (increased recycling and decreased landfilling through
the implementation of alternative technologies), emissions of
CH, from landfills in developed countries have been largely
stabilized. Choices for mature, large-scale waste management
technologies to avoid or reduce GHG emissions compared
with landfilling include incineration for waste-to-energy
and biological processes such as composting or mechanical-
biological treatment (MBT). However, in developing countries,
landfill CH, emissions are increasing as more controlled
(anaerobic) landfilling practices are being implemented. This
is especially true for rapidly urbanizing areas where engineered
landfills provide a more environmentally acceptable waste-
disposal strategy than open dumpsites by reducing disease
vectors, toxic odours, uncontrolled combustion and pollutant
emissions to air, water and soil. Paradoxically, higher GHG
emissions occur as the aerobic production of CO, (by burning
and aerobic decomposition) is shifted to anaerobic production
of CH,. To a large extent, this is the same transition to sanitary
landfilling that occurred in many developed countries during
1950-1970. The increased CH, emissions can be mitigated by
accelerating the introduction of engineered gas recovery, aided
by Kyoto mechanisms such as CDM and Joint Implementation

that the bottom-up potentials are therefore underestimated

The ranges for global economic potentials as assessed in each sector are shown by vertical lines. The ranges are based on end-use allocations of emissions,
meaning that emissions of electricity use are counted towards the end-use sectors and not to the energy supply sector.

The estimated potentials have been constrained by the availability of studies particularly at high carbon price levels.

Sectors used different baselines. For industry the SRES B2 baseline was taken, for energy supply and transport the WEO 2004 baseline was used; the building
sector is based on a baseline in between SRES B2 and A1B; for waste, SRES A1B driving forces were used to construct a waste specific baseline, agriculture
and forestry used baselines that mostly used B2 driving forces.

Only global totals for transport are shown because international aviation is included [5.4].

Categories excluded are: non-CO, emissions in buildings and transport, part of material efficiency options, heat production and cogeneration in energy supply,
heavy duty vehicles, shipping and high-occupancy passenger transport, most high-cost options for buildings, wastewater treatment, emission reduction from coal
mines and gas pipelines, fluorinated gases from energy supply and transport. The underestimation of the total economic potential from these emissions is of the
order of 10-15%.

2030 corresponds with Category III stabilization (550 ppm

level could be reached after 2030. For stabilization at levels

sectors that include low-carbon technologies will reduce risks
and costs, because fossil fuel prices are expected to be more
volatile relative to the costs of alternatives, in addition to the
usual benefits from diversification. A second general finding is
that costs will be reduced if options that correct the two market

Studies of decision-making under uncertainty emphasize the
need for stronger early action, particularly on long-lived
infrastructure and other capital stock. Energy sector
infrastructure (including power stations) alone is projected to
require at least US$ 20 trillion investment to 2030 and the options
for stabilization will be heavily constrained by the nature and
carbon intensity of this investment. Initial estimates for lower
carbon scenarios show a large redirection of investment, with
net additional investments ranging from negligible to less than
5% (high agreement, much evidence) [11.6].

"All approaches indicate that no single sector or technology
will be able to address the mitigation challenge successfully on
its own, suggesting the need for a diversified portfolio based
on a variety of criteria. Top-down assessments agree with the
bottom-up results in suggesting that carbon prices around 20-
50 US$/tCO,-eq (73-183 US$/tC-eq) are sufficient to drive
large-scale fuel-switching and make both CCS and low-carbon
power sources economic as technologies mature. Incentives
of this order might also play an important role in avoiding
deforestation. The various short- and long-term models come
up with differing estimates, the variation of which can be
explained mainly by approaches and assumptions regarding
the use of revenues from carbon taxes or permits, treatment
of technological change, degree of substitutability between
internationally traded products, and the disaggregation of
product and regional markets (high agreement, much evidence)
(11.4, 11.5, 11.6].

"A major development since the TAR has been the inclusion
in many top-down models of endogenous technological change.
Using different approaches, modelling studies suggest that
allowing for endogenous technological change may lead to
substantial reductions in carbon prices as well as GDP costs,
compared with most of the models in use at the time of the
TAR (when technological change was assumed to be included
in the baseline and largely independent of mitigation policies
and action). Studies without induced technological change
show that carbon prices rising to 20 to 80 US$/tCO;-eq by
2030 and 30 to 155 US$/tCO,-eq by 2050 are consistent with
stabilization at around 550 ppm CO,-eq by 2100. For the same
stabilization level, studies since TAR that take into account
induced technological change lower these price ranges to 5 to
65 US$/tCO,eq in 2030 and 15 to 130 US$/tCO,-eq in 2050.
The degree to which costs are reduced hinges critically on the
assumptions about the returns from climate change mitigation
R&D expenditures, spill-overs between sectors and regions,
crowding-out of other R&D, and, in models including learning-
by-doing, learning rates (high agreement, much evidence) [11.5].

"Perhaps one of the most important ways in which spill-overs
from mitigation actions in one region affect others is through
the effect on world fossil fuel prices. When a region reduces its
fossil fuel demand because of mitigation policy, it will reduce
the world demand for that commodity and so put downward
pressure on the prices. Depending on the response of the fossil
fuel producers, oil, gas or coal prices may fall, leading to loss
of revenues by the producers, and lower costs of imports for
the consumers. As in the TAR, nearly all modelling studies that
have been reviewed show more pronounced adverse effects on
oil-producing countries than on most Annex | countries that are

these links can be put into action in order to capture synergies

practice guidance for integrating climate change considerations
into relevant non-climate policies, including analysis of the
roles of different actors. Elaborating possible development

other sustainable-development goals and also reduce GHG

and/or individual actions take climate change mitigation into
consideration, in both developing and developed countries.
However, merely piggybacking climate change on to an existing
political agenda is unlikely to succeed. The ease or difficulty
with which mainstreaming is accomplished will depend on
both mitigation technologies or practices, and the underlying
development path. Weighing other development benefits against
climate benefits will be a key basis for choosing development
sectors for mainstreaming. Decisions about macro-economic

lending, insurance practices, electricity market reform, energy
security, and forest conservation, for example, which are often
treated as being apart from climate policy, can have profound
impacts on emissions, the extent of mitigation required, and the

shifting from biomass cooking to liquid petroleum gas (LPG)

Sector and mitigation
options

Potential SD synergies and conditions for
implementation

Potential SD trade-offs

 

Energy supply and use: Chapters 4-7

 

Energy efficiency
improvement in all sectors
(buildings, transportation,
industry, and energy supply)
(Chapters 4-7)

- Almost always cost-effective, reduces or eliminates local
pollutant emissions and consequent health impacts,
improves indoor comfort and reduces indoor noise levels,
creates business opportunities and jobs and improves
energy security

Government and industry programmes can help overcome
lack of information and principal agent problems
Programmes can be implemented at all levels of
government and industry

Important to ensure that low-income household energy
needs are given due consideration, and that the process
and consequences of implementing mitigation options are,
or the result is, gender-neutral

- Indoor air pollution and health impacts of
improving the thermal efficiency of biomass
cooking stoves in developing country rural areas
are uncertain

 

Fuel switching and other
options in the transportation
and buildings sectors
(Chapters 5 and 6)

- CO, reduction costs may be offset by increased health
benefits

Promotion of public transport and non-motorized
transport has large and consistent social benefits
Switching from solid fuels to modern fuels for cooking
and heating indoors can reduce indoor air pollution and
increase free time for women in developing countries
Institutionalizing planning systems for CO, reduction
through coordination between national and local
governments is important for drawing up common
strategies for sustainable transportation systems

- Diesel engines are generally more fuel-efficient
than gasoline engines and thus have lower CO,
emissions, but increase particle emissions.
Other measures (CNG buses, hybrid diesel-
electric buses and taxi renovation) may provide
little climate benefit.

 

Replacing imported

fossil fuels with domestic
alternative energy sources
(DAES) (Chapter 4)

Important to ensure that DAES is cost-effective

- Reduces local air pollutant emissions.

- Can create new indigenous industries (e.g., Brazil ethanol
programme) and hence generate employment

Balance of trade improvement is traded off
against increased capital required for investment
Fossil fuel-exporting countries may face
reduced exports

Hydropower plants may displace local
populations and cause environmental damage to
water bodies and biodiversity

 

Replacing domestic

fossil fuel with imported
alternative energy sources
(IAES) (Chapter 4)

Almost always reduces local pollutant emissions

- Implementation may be more rapid than DAES

- Important to ensure that IAES is cost-effective
Economies and societies of energy-exporting countries
would benefit

Could reduce energy security
Balance of trade may worsen but capital needs
may decline

 

Forestry sector: Chapter 9

 

Afforestation

Can reduce wasteland, arrest soil degradation, and
manage water runoff

Can retain soil carbon stocks if soil disturbance at
planting and harvesting is minimized

Can be implemented as agroforestry plantations that
enhance food production

Can generate rural employment and create rural industry
Clear delineation of property rights would expedite
implementation of forestation programmes

Use of scarce land could compete with
agricultural land and diminish food security while
increasing food costs

Monoculture plantations can reduce biodiversity
and are more vulnerable to disease

Conversion of floodplain and wetland could
hamper ecological functions

 

Avoided deforestation

Can retain biodiversity, water and soil management
benefits, and local rainfall patterns

Reduce local haze and air pollution from forest fires

If suitably managed, it can bring revenue from ecotourism
and from sustainably harvested timber sales

Successful implementation requires involving local
dwellers in land management and/or providing them
alternative livelihoods, enforcing laws to prevent migrants
from encroaching on forest land.

Can result in loss of economic welfare for certain
stakeholders in forest exploitation (land owners,
migrant workers)

Reduced timber supply may lead to reduced
timber exports and increased use of GHG-
intensive construction materials

Can result in deforestation with consequent SD
implications elsewhere

Sector and mitigation
options

Potential SD synergies and conditions for
implementation

Potential SD trade-offs

 

Bio-energy (chapter 8 en 9)

 

Bio-energy production

- Mostly positive when practised with crop residues
(shells, husks, bagasse and/or tree trimmings).

- Creates rural employment.

- Planting crops/trees exclusively for bio-energy
requires that adequate agricultural land and labour is
available to avoid competition with food production

- Can have negative environmental consequences
if practised unsustainably - biodiversity loss, water
resource competition, increased use of fertilizer and
pesticides.

- Potential problem with food security (location-
specific) and increased food costs.

 

Agriculture: Chapter 8

 

Cropland management
(management of nutrients,
tillage, residues, and
agroforestry; water, rice,
and set-aside)

- Improved nutrient management can improve
groundwater quality and environmental health of the
cultivated ecosystem

- Changes in water policies could lead to clash of
interests and threaten social cohesiveness
- Could lead to water overuse

 

Grazing land management

- Improves livestock productivity, reduces
desertification, and provide social security for the
poor

- Requires laws and enforcement to ban free grazing

 

Livestock management

- Mix of traditional rice cultivation and livestock
management would enhance incomes even in semi-
arid and arid regions

 

Waste management: Chapter 10

 

Engineered sanitary
landfilling with landfill
gas recovery to capture
methane gas

- Can eliminate uncontrolled dumping and open
burning of waste, improving health and safety for
workers and residents.

- Sites can provide local energy benefits and public
spaces for recreation and other social purposes within
the urban infrastructure.

- When done unsustainably can cause leaching that
leads to soil and groundwater contamination with
potentially negative health impacts

 

Biological

processes for waste and
wastewater (composting,
anaerobic digestion, aerobic
and anaerobic wastewater
processes)

- Can destroy pathogens and provide useful soil
amendments if properly implemented using source-
separated organic waste or collected wastewater.

- Can generate employment

- Anaerobic processes can provide energy benefits
from CH, recovery and use.

- Asource of odours and water pollution if not properly
controlled and monitored.

 

Incineration and other
thermal processes

- Obtain the most energy benefit from waste.

- Expensive relative to controlled landfilling and
composting.

- Unsustainable in developing countries if technical
infrastructure not present.

- Additional investment for air pollution controls and
source separation needed to prevent emissions of
heavy metals and other air toxics.

 

Recycling, re-use, and
waste minimization

 

- Provide local employment as well as reductions in
energy and raw materials for recycled products.

- Can be aided by NGO efforts, private capital for
recycling industries, enforcement of environmental
regulations, and urban planning to segregate waste
treatment and disposal activities from community life.

 

- Uncontrolled waste scavenging results in severe
health and safety problems for those who make their
living from waste

- Development of local recycling industries requires
capital.

"e Regulatory measures and standards generally provide
environmental certainty. They may be preferable when lack
of information or other barriers prevent firms and consumers
from responding to price signals. Regulatory standards
do not generally give polluters incentives to develop
new technologies to reduce pollution, but there are a few
examples whereby technology innovation has been spurred
by regulatory standards. Standards are common practice
in the building sector and there is strong innovation.
Although relatively few regulatory standards have been
adopted solely to reduce GHG emissions, standards have
reduced these gases as a co-benefit (high agreement, much
evidence) [13.2].

e Taxes and charges (which can be applied to carbon or all
GHGs) are given high marks for cost effectiveness since
they provide some assurance regarding the marginal cost
of pollution control. They cannot guarantee a particular
level of emissions, but conceptually taxes can be designed
to be environmentally effective. Taxes can be politically
difficult to implement and adjust. As with regulations, their
environmental effectiveness depends on their stringency.
As with nearly all other policy instruments, care is needed
to prevent perverse effects (high agreement, much evidence)

of resource use, whether energy, water, or land, yield positive
benefitsacrossallthree dimensions ofsustainabledevelopment.
Other categories of mitigation options have a more uncertain
impact and depend on the wider socio-economic context
within which the option is being implemented.

e Climate-related policies such as energy efficiency and
renewable energy are often economically beneficial, improve
energy security and reduce local pollutant emissions. Many
energy-supply mitigation options can be designed to also
achieve sustainable development benefits such as avoided
displacement of local populations, job creation and health
benefits.

soil and water conservation benefits, but may result in a loss
of economic welfare for some stakeholders. Appropriately
designed forestation and bio-energy plantations can lead to
restoration of degraded land, manage water runoff, retain soil
carbon and benefit rural economies, but may compete with
land for food production and be negative for biodiversity.

atmospheric concentrations. It would be more effective if the

must be carefully designed to avoid perverse market
effects. Direct and indirect subsidies for fossil fuel use and
agriculture remain common practice in many countries,
although those for coal have declined over the past decade
in many OECD countries and in some developing countries
(See also Chapter 2, 7 and 11) [13.2].

Government support for research and development
is a special type of incentive, which can be an important
instrument to ensure that low GHG-emitting technologies
will be available in the long-term. However, government
funding for many energy-research programmes dropped
after the oil crisis in the 1970s and stayed constant, even
after the UNFCCC was ratified. Substantial additional
investments in, and policies for, R&D are needed to ensure
that technologies are ready for commercialization in order
to arrive at stabilization of GHGs in the atmosphere (see
Chapter 3), along with economic and regulatory instruments
to promote their deployment and diffusion (high agreement,
much evidence) [13.2.1].

Information instruments — sometimes called public
disclosure requirements -— may positively affect
environmental quality by allowing consumers to make
better-informed choices. There is only limited evidence
that the provision of information can achieve emissions
reductions, but it can improve the effectiveness of other
policies (high agreement, much evidence) [13.2].

by science, as it inherently involves normative judgements.
There are different approaches to defining danger, and an

agreement(s) reached among the Parties in terms of what may

to define levels of climate change that could be tolerable or
intolerable, or which could be characterized by different levels
of risk. In the late 1980s, the World Meteorological Organization
(WMO)/International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU)/
UN Environment Programme (UNEP) Advisory Group on
Greenhouse Gases (AGGG) identified two main temperature
indicators or thresholds with different levels of risk (Rijsberman
and Swart, 1990). Based on the available knowledge at the time
a 2°C increase was determined to be ‘an upper limit beyond
which the risks of grave damage to ecosystems, and of non-
linear responses, are expected to increase rapidly’. This early

"Sustainable development has environmental, economic
and social dimensions (see Chapter 2, Section 2.1). Properly
designed climate change responses can be part and parcel
of sustainable development, and the two can be mutually
reinforcing (Section 2.1). Mitigation, by limiting climate
change, can conserve or enhance natural capital (ecosystems,
the environment as sources and sinks for economic activities)
and prevent or avoid damage to human systems and, thereby,
contribute to the overall productivity of capital needed for
socio-economic development, including mitigative and adaptive
capacity. In turn, sustainable development paths can reduce
vulnerability to climate change and reduce GHG emissions.
The projected climate changes can exacerbate poverty and
thereby undermine sustainable development (see, for example,

"The IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR) identified
five broad categories of reasons for concern that are relevant
to Article 2: (1) Risks to unique and threatened systems, (2)
risks from extreme climatic events, (3) regional distribution of
impacts, (4) aggregate impacts and (5) risks from large-scale
discontinuities. The Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) focuses
on Key Vulnerabilities relevant to Article 2, which are broadly
categorized into biological systems, social systems, geophysical
systems, extreme events and regional systems (IPCC, 2007b,
Chapter 19). The implications of different interpretations of
dangerous anthropogenic interference for future emission
pathways are reviewed in IPCC (2007b), Chapter 9 and also
in Chapter 3 of this report. The literature confirms that climate
policy can substantially reduce the risk of crossing thresholds
deemed dangerous (IPCC, 2007b, SPM and Chapter 19; Chapter
3, Section 3.5.2 of this report).

"Decisions made in relation to Article 2 will determine the
level of climate change that is set as the goal for policy and have
fundamental implications for emission reduction pathways,
the feasibility, timing and scale of adaptation required and the
magnitude of unavoidable losses. The emission pathways which
correspond to different GHG or radiative forcing stabilization
levels and consequential global warming are reviewed in
Chapter 3 (see Tables 3.9 and 3.10). The potential consequences
of two hypothetical limits can provide an indication of the
differing scales of mitigation action that depend on Article 2
decisions: A 2°C above pre-industrial limit on global warming
would implies that emissions peak within the next decade and
be reduced to less than 50% of the current level by 20503; a
4°C limit would imply that emissions may not have to peak
until well after the middle of the century and could still be well
above 2000 levels in 2100. In relation to the first hypothetical
limt, the latter would have higher levels of adaptation costs and
unavoidable losses, but carry lower mitigation costs.

"work also identified the rate of change to be of importance to
determining the level of risk, a conclusion that has subsequently
been confirmed qualitatively (IPCC, 2007b, Chapters 4 and
19). More recently, others in the scientific community have
reached conclusions that point in a similar direction ‘that global
warming of more than 1°C, relative to 2000, will constitute
“dangerous” climate change as judged from likely effects on
sea level and extermination of species’ (Hansen et al., 2006).
Probabilistic assessments have also been made that demonstrate
how scientific uncertainties, different normative judgments
on acceptable risks to different systems (Mastrandrea and
Schneider, 2004) and/or interference with the climate system
(Harvey, 2007) affect the levels of change or interference set as
goals for policy (IPCC, 2007b, Chapter 19). From an economic
perspective, the Stern Review (Stern, 2006) found that in order
to minimise the most harmful consequences of climate change,
concentrations would need to be stabilized below 550 ppm
CO,-eq. The Review further argues that any delay in reducing
emissions would be ‘would be costly and dangerous’. This
latter conclusion is at variance with the conclusions drawn from
earlier economic analyses which support a slow ‘ramp up’ of
climate policy action (Nordhaus, 2006) and, it has been argued,
is a consequence of the approach taken by the Stern Review to
intergenerational equity (Dasgupta, 2006).

exhibit a range of time scales, and there can be substantial
lead times required before measures can be implemented

"Uncertainty in knowledge is an important aspect in the
implementation of Article 2, whether it is assessing future
GHG emissions or the severity of climate change impacts
and regional changes, evaluating these impacts over many
generations, estimating mitigation costs or evaluating the level

these uncertainties, mitigation will reduce the risk of both global

"Inertia in both the climate and socio-economic systems would
need to be taken into account when mitigation actions are being
considered. Mitigation actions aimed at specific climate goals
would need to factor in the response times of the climate system,
including those of the carbon cycle, atmosphere and oceans.
A large part of the atmospheric response to radiative forcing
occurs on decadal time scales, but a substantial component is
linked to the century time scales of the oceanic response to
the same forcing changes (Meehl ef al., 2007). Once GHG
concentrations are stabilized global mean temperature would
very likely stabilize within a few decades, although a further
slight increase may still occur over several centuries (Mechl
et al., 2007). The rise in sea level, however, would continue
for many centuries after GHG stabilization due to both ongoing
heat uptake by the oceans and the long time scale of ice sheet
response to warming (Meehl et al., 2007). The time scales

changes in the climate and the climate system as a result of
human interference (Solomon ef al., 2007; IPCC, 2007b,
Chapter 19 Tables 19.1 and 19.3.5-7). These include changes in
climate variability (El Nino Southern Oscillation, monsoons); a
high likelihood that warming will lead to an increase in the risk
of many extreme events, including floods, droughts, heat waves
and fires, with increasing levels of adverse impacts; a risk that
a 1-2°C sustained global warming (versus the temperature at
present) would lead to a commitment to a large sea-level rise
due to at least the partial deglaciation of both ice sheets; an
uncertain risk of a shutdown of the North Atlantic Meridional
Overturning Circulation; a large increase in the intensity of
tropical cyclones with increasing levels of adverse impacts as
temperatures increase; the risk that positive feedbacks from
warming may cause the release of CO, or methane (CH,) from
the terrestrial biosphere and soils (IPCC, 2007b, Chapter 19
Tables 19.1 and 19.3.5-7). In the latter case, a positive climate—
carbon cycle feedback would reduce the land and ocean uptake
of CO,, implying a reduction of the allowable emissions
required to achieve a given atmospheric CO, stabilization level

"Adaptation and mitigation can be complementary,
substitutable or independent of each other (see IPCC, 2007b,
Chapter 18). If complementary, adaptation reduces the costs
of climate change impacts and thus reduces the benefits
of mitigation. Although adaptation and mitigation may be
substitutable up to a certain point, they are never perfect
substitutes for each other since mitigation will always be required
to avoid ‘dangerous’ and irreversible changes to the climate
system. Irrespective of the scale of the mitigation measures that
are implemented in the next 10-20 years, adaptation measures
will still be required due to the inertia in the climate system. As
reported in IPCC, 2007b, Chapter 19 (and also noted in Stern
(2006)), changes in the climate are already causing setbacks to
economic and social development in some developing countries
with temperature increases of less than 1°C. Unabated climate
change would increase the risks and costs very substantially
(IPCC, 2007b, Chapter 19). Both adaptation and mitigation
depend on capital assets, including social capital, and both
affect capital vulnerability and GHG emissions (see Chapter 2,
Section 2.5.2). Through this mutual dependence, both are tied
to sustainable development (see Sections 2.5, 11.8 and 11.9,
12.2 and 12.3).

future generations. Climate change is subject to a very
asymmetric distribution of present emissions and future
impacts and vulnerabilities. Equity can be elaborated in terms
of distributing the costs of mitigation or adaptation, distributing
future emission rights and ensuring institutional and procedural
fairness (Chapter 13, Section 13.3.4.3). Equity also exhibits
preventative (avoidance of damage inflicted on others),
retributive (sanctions), and corrective elements (e.g. ‘common

"The incentive to evade mitigation costs increases with
the degree of substitutability among individual mitigation
efforts (mitigation is largely additive) and with the inequality
of the distribution of net benefits among regime participants.
However, individual mitigation costs decrease with efficient
mitigation actions undertaken by others. Because mitigation
efforts are additive, the larger the number of participants, the
smaller the individual cost of providing the public good — in
this case, climate system stabilization. Cooperation requires the
sharing of both information on climate change and technologies
through technology transfers as well as the coordination of
national actions lest the efforts required by the climate regime
be underprovided.

"Since pre-industrial times, increasing emissions of GHGs due
to human activities have led to a marked increase in atmospheric
concentrations of the long-lived GHG gases carbon dioxide

hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF,) and
ozone-depleting substances (ODS; chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs),
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), halons) and the human-
induced radiative forcing of the Earth’s climate is largely due to
the increases in these concentrations. The predominant sources
of the increase in GHGs are from the combustion of fossil fuels.
Atmospheric CO, concentrations have increased by almost 100
ppm in comparison to its preindustrial levels, reaching 379

"The climate system tends to be overused (excessive GHG
concentrations) because of its natural availability as a resource
whose access is open to all free of charge. In contrast, climate
protection tends to be underprovided. In general, the benefits
of avoided climate change are spatially indivisible, freely
available to all (non-excludability), irrespective of whether one
is contributing to the regime costs or not. As regime benefits by
one individual (nation) do not diminish their availability to others
(non-rivalry), it is difficult to enforce binding commitments on
the use of the climate system* (Kaul et al., 1999; 2003). This
may result in ‘free riding’, a situation in which mitigation costs
are borne by some individuals (nations) while others (the ‘free

accounted for 81% of total energy use in 2004 — slightly down
from the 86% more than 30 years ago, mainly due to the increase
in the use of nuclear energy. Despite the substantial growth of
non-traditional renewable forms of energy, especially wind

efficiency improvements and fuel switching. If the efficiency
and fuel mix had remained at their 1990 values, emissions
in 2003 would have been some 34% above actual emissions,
however linking these reductions to specific policies was found
to be difficult. For the UK and Germany about 60% of the
reductions from 1990 to 2000 were found to be due to factors

"GDP/capita and population growth were the main drivers of
the increase in global emissions during the last three decades
of the 20th century. However, consistently declining energy
intensities indicate structural changes in the global energy
system. The role of carbon intensity in offsetting emission growth
has been declining over the last two decades. The reduction in
carbon intensity of energy supply was the strongest between
1980 and 1990 due to the delayed effect of the oil price shocks
of the 1970s, and it approached zero towards the year 2000 and
reversed after 2000 At the global scale, declining carbon and
energy intensities have been unable to offset income effects and
population growth and, consequently, carbon emissions have
risen. Under the reference scenario of the International Energy
Agency (IEA, 2006a) these trends are expected to remain valid
until 2030; in particular, energy is not expected to be further
decarbonized under this baseline scenario.

selected developing countries by Chandler et al. (2002), the
substitution of gasoline-fuelled cars with ethanol-fuelled cars
and that of conventional CHP (combined heat and power; also
cogeneration) plants with sugar-cane bagasse CHP plants in
Brazil resulted in an estimated carbon emission abatement of
23.5 MtCO, in 2000 (actual emissions in 2000: 334 MtCO,).
According to the same study, economic and energy reforms in
China curbed the use of low-grade coal, resulting in avoided
emissions of some 366 MtCO, (actual emissions: 3,100
MtCO,). In India, energy policy initiatives including demand-
side efficiency improvements are estimated to have reduced
emissions by 66 MtCO, (compared with the actual emission
level of 1,060 MtCO,). In Mexico, the switch to natural gas, the
promotion of efficiency improvements and lower deforestation
are estimated to have resulted in 37 MtCO, of emission

"Since 2000, however, many more policies have been put
into place, including those falling under the European Climate
Change Programme (ECCP), and significant progress has been
made, including the establishment of the EU Emissions Trading
Scheme (EU ETS) (CEC, 2006). A review of the effectiveness
of the first stage of the ECCP reported that about one third of
the potential reductions had been fully implemented by mid
2006!'. Overall EU-25 emissions in 2004 were 0.9% lower than
in the base year, and the European Commission (EC) assessed
the EC Kyoto target (8% reduction relative to the base year)
to be within reach under the conditions that (1) all additional
measures currently under discussion are put into force in time,
(2) Kyoto mechanisms are used to the full extent planned and
(3) removals from Articles 3.3 and 3.4 activities (carbon sinks)
contribute to the extent projected (CEC, 2006). Overall this
shows that climate policies can be effective, but that they are
difficult to fully implement and require continual improvement
in order to achieve the desired objectives.

accompany the early stages of the industrialization process,
which is closely linked to accelerated electricity generation
mainly based on fossil fuels (primarily coal). In addition, the
emerging but rapidly growing transport sector is fuelled by
oil, which further contributes to increasing carbon intensities.
Stepped-up fossil fuel use, GDP/capita growth and, to a lesser

in carbon emissions in India and China.

continue to grow over the projection period. The growth of
new renewables, while robust, starts from a relatively small
base. Sectoral growth in energy demand is principally in the
electricity generation and transport sectors, and together these

"Energy security also means access to affordable energy
services by those people — largely in developing countries — who
currently lack such access. It is part and parcel of sustainable
development and plays a non-negligible role in mitigating
climate change. Striving for enhanced energy security can
impact GHG emissions in opposite ways. On the one hand, GHG
emissions may be reduced as the result of a further stimulation
of rational energy use, efficiency improvements, innovation
and the development of alternative energy technologies
with inherent climate benefits. On the other hand, measures
supporting energy security may lead to higher GHG emissions
due to stepped-up use of indigenous coal or the development of
lower quality and unconventional oil resources.

"A variety of projections of the energy picture have been
made for the coming decades. These differ in terms of their
modelling structure and input assumptions and, in particular,
on the evolution of policy in the coming decades. For example,
the IEA’s World Energy Outlook 2006 reference case (IEA,
2006a) and the the International Energy Outlook of the Energy
Information Agency in the USA reference case (EIA, 2006b)
have both developed sets of scenarios; however, all of these
scenarios project a continued dependence on fossil fuels (see
Chapter 4 for past global energy mixes and future energy
demand and supply projections). Should there be no change
in energy policies, the energy mix supplied to run the global
economy in the 2025-2030 time frame will essentially remain
unchanged with about 80% (IEA, 2006a) of the energy supply
based on fossil fuels. In other words, the energy economy may
evolve, but not radically change unless policies change.

"With international oil prices fluctuating around 70 USD
per barrel (Brent Crude in the first half of 2006; EIA, 2006a)
and with prices of internationally traded natural gas, coal and
uranium following suit, concerns of energy supply security
are back on the agenda of many public and private sector
institutions. Consequently, there is renewed public interest in
alternatives to fossil fuels, especially to oil, resulting in new
technology initiatives to promote hydrogen, biofuels, nuclear
power and renewables (Section 1.3.1.3). Higher oil prices
also tend to open up larger markets for more carbon-intensive
liquid fuel production systems, such as shale oil or tar sands.
However, first and foremost, energy security concerns tend
to invigorate a higher reliance on indigenous energy supplies
and resources. Regions where coal is the dominant domestic
energy resource tend to use more coal, especially for electricity
generation, which increases GHG emissions. In recent years,
intensified coal use has been observed for a variety of reasons
in developing Asian countries, the USA and some European
countries. In a number of countries, the changing relative prices
of coal to natural gas have changed the dispatch order in power
generation in favour of coal.

that period. Two thirds to three quarters of the increase in CO,
emissions are projected to come from developing countries,
although the average per capita CO, emissions in developing
country regions will remain substantially lower (2.8— 5.1 tCO,
per capita) than those in developed country regions (9.6—15.1

"Fluorinated gases. Concentrations of many of these gases
have increased by large factors (i.e., 1.3 and 4.3) between 1998
and 2005, and their radiative forcing is rapidly increasing (from
low levels) by roughly 10% per year (Forster et a/., 2007). Any
projection of overall environmental impacts and emissions is
complicated by the fact that several major applications retain
the bulk of their fluorinated gases during their respective life
cycles, resulting in the accumulation of significant stocks that
need to be responsibly managed when these applications are
eventually decommissioned. A comprehensive review of such
assessments was published in an earlier IPCC Special Report
(IPCC, 2005). This review reported growth in HFC emissions
from about 0.4 GtCO,-eq in 2002 to 1.2 GtCO,-eq per year
in 2015. Chapter 3 also describes in some detail the results of
long-term GHG emissions scenarios. The range projected by
SRES scenarios for 2030 is 1.0—-1.6 GtCO,-eq (increase of 190—
360% compared to 2000) and the EMF-21 baseline scenarios
are quite close to this (1.2-1.7 GtCO,-eq per year, an increase
of 115-240% compared to 2000). By 2100, the SRES range is
1.4-4 GtCO,-eq per year (an increase of 300% to more than
1000 % compared to 2000), whereas the new EMF-21 baseline
scenarios are higher still (1.9-6.3 GtCO,-eq).

"Technology research and development (R&D) are important
for altering the emission trends shown in the previous sections.
In the absence of measures fostering the development of
climate-friendly technologies and/or a lack of incentives for
their deployment, however, it is not a priori obvious in which
direction R&D will influence emissions. Because of the
longevity of energy infrastructures (lock-in effect), it is the
near-term investment decisions in the development, deployment
and diffusion of technologies that will determine the long-term
development of the energy system and its emissions (Gritsevskyi
and Nakicenovic, 2002).

"There are various types of technologies that can play
significant roles in mitigating climate change, including
energy efficiency improvements throughout the energy system

fusion and geothermal, biomass and clean fossil technologies,
including carbon capture and storage; energy from waste;
hydrogen production from non-fossil energy sources and fuel
cells (Pacala and Socolow, 2004; IEA, 2006b). Some are in
their infancy and require public RDDD&D support, while
others are more mature and need only market incentives for
their deployment and diffusion. Some also need persevering
efforts for public acceptance (Tokushige et a/., 2006) as well as

different entities and processes. At the international level, these
include the Millennium Development Goals, the World Summit

Sustainable Development (CSD), all of which have broad
and important connections to climate change in the context of
sustainable development, energy and poverty eradication. Other

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
"	Title
"The potential linkages between climate change mitigation
and adaptation policies have been explored in an emerging
"	Text
"literature. It is concluded that there is a number of factors that
condition societies’ or individual stakeholders’ capacity to
implement climate change mitigation and adaptation policies
including social, economic, and environmental costs, access to
resources, credit, and the decision-making capacity in itself.
"	Text
"This chapter frames climate change mitigation policies in
the context of general development issues and recognizes
that there is a two-way relationship between climate change
and sustainable development. These relationships create a
wide potential for linking climate change and sustainable
development policies, and an emerging literature has identified
methodological approaches and specific policies that can
be used to explore synergies and tradeoffs between climate
change and economic, social, and environmental sustainability
dimensions.
"	Text
"Like most policy-making, climate policy involves trading off
risks and uncertainties. Risks and uncertainties have not only
natural but also human and social dimensions. They arise from
missing, incomplete and imperfect evidence, from voluntary or
involuntary limits to information management, from difficulties
in incorporating some variables into formal analysis, as well as
from the inherently unpredictable elements of complex systems.
An increasing international literature considers how the limits
of the evidence basis and other sources of uncertainties can be
estimated.
"	Text
"Climate change has considerable implications for intra-
generational and inter-generational equity, and the application
of different equity approaches has major implications for policy
recommendations, as well as for the implied distribution of costs
and benefits of climate policies. Different approaches to social
justice can be applied when evaluating equity consequences
of climate change policies. They span traditional economic
approaches where equity appears in terms of the aggregated
welfare consequences of adaptation and mitigation policies,
and rights-based approaches that argue that social actions are to
be judged in relation to the defined rights of individuals.
"	Text
"Decision-making about climate change policies is a very
complex and demanding task since there is no single decision-
maker and different stakeholders assign different values
to climate change impacts and to the costs and benefits of
policy actions. However, many new initiatives emerge from
governmental cooperation efforts, the business sector and
NGOs (non-governmental organizations), so various coalitions
presently play an increasing role. A large number of analytical
approaches can be used to support decision-making, and
progress has been made both in integrated assessment models,
policy dialogues and other decision support tools.
"	Text
"Costs and benefits of climate change mitigation policies can
be assessed (subject to the uncertainties noted above) at project,
firm, technology, sectoral, community, regional, national or
multinational levels. Inputs can include financial, economic,
ecological and social factors. In formal cost-benefit analyses,
the discount rate is one major determinant of the present value
of costs and benefits, since climate change, and mitigation/
adaptation measures all involve impacts spread over very long
time periods. Much of the literature uses constant discount
rates at a level estimated to reflect time preference rates as
used when assessing typical large investments. Some recent
literature also includes recommendations about using time-
decreasing discount rates, which reflect uncertainty about future
economic growth, fairness and intra-generational distribution,
and observed individual choices. Based on this, some countries
officially recommend using time-decreasing discount rates for
long time horizons.
"	Text
"The cost and pace of any response to climate change concerns
will critically depend on the social context, as well as the cost,
performance, and availability of technologies. Technological
change is particularly important over the long-term time
scales that are characteristic of climate change. Decade (or
longer) time scales are typical for the gaps involved between
technological innovation and widespread diffusion, and of the
capital turnover rates characteristic for long-term energy capital
stock and infrastructures. The development and deployment of
technology is adynamic process that arises through the actions of
human beings, and different social and economic systems have
different proclivities to induce technological change, involving
a different set of actors and institutions in each step. The state
of technology and technology change, as well as human capital
and other resources, can differ significantly from country to
country and sector to sector, depending on the starting point of
infrastructure, technical capacity, the readiness of markets to
provide commercial opportunities and policy frameworks.

"The climate change mitigation framing issues in general are
characterized by high agreement/much evidence relating to the
range of theoretical and methodological issues that are relevant
in assessing mitigation options. Sustainable development
and climate change, mitigation and adaptation relationships,
and equity consequences of mitigation policies are areas
where there is conceptual agreement on the range of possible
approaches, but relatively few lessons can be learned from
studies, since these are still limited (high agreement, limited
evidence). Other issues, such as mitigation cost concepts and
technological change are very mature in the mitigation policy
literature, and there is high agreement/much evidence relating
to theory, modelling, and other applications. In the same way,
decision-making approaches and various tools and approaches
are characterized by high agreement on the range of conceptual
issues (high agreement, much evidence), but there is significant
divergence in the applications, primarily since some approaches
have been applied widely and others have only been applied to

"a more limited extent (high agreement, limited evidence). There
is some debate about which of these framing methodologies
and issues relating to mitigation options are most important,
reflecting (amongst other things) different ethical choices — to
this extent at least there is an irreducible level of uncertainty
(high agreement, limited evidence).

"The IPCC’s Third Assessment Report (TAR; IPCC, 2001)
included considerations concerning SD and climate change.
These issues were addressed particularly by Working Group II
and III, as well as the Synthesis report. The TAR included a
rather broad treatment of SD (Metz et al., 2002). The report
noted three broad classes of analyses or perspectives: efficiency
and cost-effectiveness, equity and sustainable development,
and global sustainability and societal learning.

"Policies and institutions that focus on development also
affect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and vulnerability.
Moreover, these same policies and institutions constrain or
facilitate mitigation and adaptation. These indirect effects can
be positive or negative, and several studies have therefore
suggested the integration of climate change adaptation and
mitigation perspectives into development policies, since
sustainable development requires coping with climate change
"	Text
"Climate policies can be more effective when consistently
embedded within broader strategies designed to make national
and regional development paths more sustainable. This occurs
because the impact of climate variability and change, climate
policy responses, and associated socio-economic development
will affect the ability of countries to achieve sustainable
development goals. Conversely, the pursuit of those goals will
in turn affect the opportunities for, and success of, climate
policies.

"This section introduces the relationship between sustainable
development (SD) and climate change and presents a number
of key concepts that can be used to frame studies of these
relationships. Climate change and sustainable development are
considered in several places throughout this report. Chapter 12
provides a general overview of the issues, while more specific
issues relating to short- and long-term mitigation issues are
addressed in Chapters 3 (Section 3.1) and 11 (Section 11.6).
Sectoral issues are covered in Chapters 4-10 (Sections 4.5.4,
5.5.5, 6.9.2, 7.7, 8.4.5, 9.7, and in 10.6). Furthermore, the IPCC
(2007b) addresses SD and climate change in Chapters 18 and
20.
"	Text
"Climate change adaptation and mitigation can also be the
focus of policy interventions and SD can be considered as an
issue that is indirectly influenced. Such climate policies can tend
to focus on sectoral policies, projects and policy instruments,
which meet the adaptation and mitigation goals, but are not
necessarily strongly linked to all the economic, social, and
environmental dimensions of sustainable development. In
this case climate change policy implementation in practice
can encounter some conflicts between general development
goals and the goal of protecting the global environment.
Furthermore, climate policies that do not take economic and
social considerations into account might not be sustainable in
the long run.
"	Text
"In conclusion, one might then distinguish between climate
change policies that emerge as an integrated element of general
sustainable development policies, and more specific adaptation
and mitigation policies that are selected and assessed primarily
in their capacity to address climate change. Examples of the
first category of policies can be energy efficiency measures,
energy access and affordability, water management systems,
and food security options, while examples of more specific
adaptation and mitigation policies can be flood control, climate
information systems, and the introduction of carbon taxes. It
is worth noticing that the impacts on sustainable development
and climate change adaptation and mitigation of all these policy
examples are very context specific, so it cannot in general be
concluded whether a policy supports sustainable development
and climate change jointly or if there are serious tradeoffs
between economic and social perspectives and climate change
(see also Chapter 12 of this report and Chapter 18 of IPCC
(2007b) for a more extensive discussion).

"Since the TAR, literature on sustainable development and
climate change has attempted to further develop approaches that
can be used to assess specific development and climate policy
options and choices in this context (Beg et al., 2002; Cohen eral.,

have included discussions about how distinctions can be made
between natural processes and feedbacks, and human and social
interactions that influence the natural systems and that can be
influenced by policy choices (Barker, 2003). These choices
include immediate and very specific climate policy responses
as well as more general policies on development pathways and
the capacity for climate change adaptation and mitigation. See

"The debate on sustainability has generated a great deal of
research and policy discussion on the meaning, measurability
and feasibility of sustainable development. Despite the intrinsic
ambiguity in the concept of sustainability, it is now perceived
as an irreducible holistic concept where economic, social,
and environmental issues are interdependent dimensions that
must be approached within a unified framework (Hardi and
Barg, 1997; Dresner, 2002; Meadows, 1998). However, the
interpretation and valuation of these dimensions have given rise
to a diversity of approaches.

"Sustainable development (SD) has been discussed
extensively in the theoretical literature since the concept
was adopted as an overarching goal of economic and social
development by UN agencies, by the Agenda 21 nations, and
by many local governments and private-sector actors. The SD
literature largely emerged as a reaction to a growing interest
in considering the interactions and potential conflicts between
economic development and the environment. SD was defined
by the World Commission on Environment and Development in
the report Our Common Future as ‘development that meets the
needs of the present without compromising the ability of future
generations to meet their own needs’ (WCED, 1987).

"A growing body of concepts and models, which explores
reality from different angles and in a variety of contexts, has
emerged in recent years in response to the inability of normal
disciplinary science to deal with complexity and systems — the
challenges of sustainability. The outlines of this new framework,
known under the loose term of ‘Systems Thinking’, are, by their
very nature, transdisciplinary and synthetic (Kay and Foster,
1999). An international group of ecologists, economists, social
scientists and mathematicians has laid the principles and basis
of an integrative theory of systems change (Holling 2001).
This new theory is based on the idea that systems of nature and
human systems, as well as combined human and nature systems
and social-ecological systems, are interlinked in never-ending
adaptive cycles of growth, accumulation, restructuring, and
renewal within hierarchical structures (Holling et a/., 2002).

"Recognizing the dual relationship between SD and climate
change points to a need for the exploration of policies
that jointly address SD and climate change. A number of
international study programmes, including the Development
and Climate project (Halsnaes and Verhagen, 2007), and an
OECD development and environment directorate programme
(Beg et al., 2002) explore the potential of SD-based climate
change policies. Other activities include projects by the World
Resources Institute (Baumert et a/., 2002), and the PEW Centre
(Heller and Shukla, 2003). Furthermore, the international
literature also includes work by Cohen et a/., 1998; Banuri and

"A core element in the economic literature on SD is the
focus on growth and the use of man-made, natural, and social
capital. The fact that there are three different types of capital
that can contribute to economic growth has led to a distinction
between weak and strong sustainability, as discussed by Pearce
and Turner (1990), and Rennings and Wiggering (1997). Weak
sustainability describes a situation where it is assumed that the
total capital is maintained and that the three different elements
of the capital stock can, to some extent, be used to substitute
each other in a sustainable solution. On the other hand, strong
sustainability requires each of the three types of capital to be
maintained in its own right, at least at some minimum level. An
example of an application of the strong sustainability concept
is Herman Daly’s criteria, which state that renewable resources
must be harvested at (or below) some predetermined stock level,
and renewable substitutes must be developed to offset the use
of exhaustible resources (Daly, 1990). Furthermore, pollution
emissions should be limited to the assimilative capacity of the
environment.

capital assets, Arrow et al. (2004) only consider institutions in
their capacity as guiding the allocation of resources, including
capital assets. Institutions in this context include the legal
structure, formal and informal markets, various government
agencies, inter-personal networks, and the rules and norms that
guide their behaviour. Seen from an SD perspective, the issue
is then: how, and to what extent, can policies and institutional
frameworks for these influence the productive basis of society
and thereby make development patterns more sustainable.

"When applying such a pragmatic approach to the concept
of SD it is important to recognize that major conceptual
understandings and assumptions rely on the underlying
development paradigms and analytical approaches that are
used in studies. The understanding of development goals and
the tradeoffs between different policy objectives depends
on the development paradigm applied, and the following
section will provide a number of examples on how policy
recommendations about SD and climate change depend on
alternative understandings of development as such.

"The literature includes other views of capital assets that will
consider institutions and sustainable development policies as
being part of the social capital element in society’s productive
base. Lehtonen (2004) provides an overview of the discussion
on social capital and other assets. He concludes that despite
capabilities and social capital concepts not yet being at the
practical application stage, the concepts can be used as useful
metaphors, which can help to structure thoughts across different
disciplines. Lehtonen refers to analysis of social-environmental
dimensions by the OECD (1998) that addresses aspects such as
demography, health, employment, equity, information, training,
and a number of governance issues, as an example ofa pragmatic
approach to including social elements in sustainability studies.

"Arrow et al., (2004) summarize the controversy between
economists and ecologists by saying that ecologists have deemed
current consumption patterns to be excessive or deficient in
relation to sustainable development, while economists have
focused more on the ability of the economy to maintain living
standards. It is concluded here that the sustainability criterion
implies that inter-temporal welfare should be optimized in order
to ensure that current consumption is not excessive.2 However,
the optimal level of current consumption cannot be determined
(i.e. due to various uncertainties). Theoretical considerations
therefore focus instead on factors that make current consumption
more or less sustainable. These factors include the relationship
between market rates of return on investments and social
discount rates, and the relationship between market prices of
consumption goods (including capital goods) and the social
costs of these commodities.

"Alargenumber ofthe models that have beenused for mitigation
studies are applications of economic paradigms. Studies that are
based on economic theory typically include a specification of a
number of goals that are considered as important elements in
welfare or human wellbeing. Some economic paradigms focus
on the welfare function of the economy, assuming efficient
resource allocation (such as in neoclassical economics), and do
not consider deviations from this state and ways to overcome
these. In terms of analyzing development and climate linkages,
this approach will see climate change mitigation as an effort
that adds a cost to the optimal economic state.3 However, there
is a very rich climate mitigation cost literature that concludes
that market imperfections in practice often create a potential for
mitigation policies that can help to increase the efficiency of
energy markets and thereby generate indirect cost savings that
can make mitigation policies economically attractive (IPCC,
1996, Chapters 8 and 9; IPCC, 2001, Chapters 7 and 8). The
character of such market imperfections is discussed further in

"Akey framework that can be used to organize the evaluation
of SD and climate change linkages is the WEHAB‘ framework
that was introduced by the World Summit on Sustainable
Development in 2002 (WSSD, 2002). The WEHAB sectors
reflect the areas selected by the parties at the WSSD meeting
to emphasize that particular actions were needed in order to
implement Agenda 21. Seen from a climate change policy
evaluation perspective it would be relevant to add a few
more sectors to the WEHAB group in order to facilitate a
comprehensive coverage of major SD and climate change
linkages. These sectors include human settlements tourism,
industry, and transportation. It would also be relevant to
consider demography, institutions and various cultural issues
and values as cross-cutting sectoral issues.

"Key theoretical contributions to the economic growth and
development debate also include work by A. Sen (1999) and
P. Dasgupta (1993) concerning capabilities and human well-
being. Dasgupta, in his inquiry into well-being and destitution,
concludes that ‘our citizens’ achievements are the wrong things
to look at. We should be looking at the extent to which they enjoy
the freedom to achieve their ends, no matter what their ends
turn out to be. The problem is that the extent of such freedoms
depends upon the degree to which citizens make use of income
and basic needs’. (Dasgupta, 1993, pp. 54). Following this,
Dasgupta recommends studying the distribution of resources,
as opposed to outcomes (which, for example, can be measured
in terms of welfare). The access to income and basic needs are
seen as a fundamental basis for human well-being and these
needs include education, food, energy, medical care etc. that
individuals can use as inputs to meeting their individual desires.

"Weak institutions have a lot of implications for the capacity
to adapt or mitigate to climate change, as well as in relation
to the implementation of development policies. A review of
the social capital literature related to economic aspects and the
implications for climate change mitigation policies concludes
that, in most cases, successful implementation of GHG emission-
reduction options will depend on additional measures to increase
the potential market and the number of exchanges. This can
involve strengthening the incentives for exchange (prices,
capital markets, information efforts etc.), introducing new
actors (institutional and human capacity efforts), and reducing
the risks of participation (legal framework, information, general
policy context of market regulation). All these measures depend
on the nature of the formal institutions, the social groups of
society, and the interactions between them (Olhoff, 2002). See
also Chapter 12 of this report for a more extensive discussion of
the political science and sociological literature in this area.

a number of energy goals to the MDGs (i.e. to reflect energy
security and the role that energy access can play in poverty

policy decisions related to economic, social and environmental

are again framed by government policies, markets, information
sharing, culture, and a number of other factors. Some of the
decisions that are critically important in this context are
investments, use of natural resources, energy consumption,
land use, technology choice, and consumption and lifestyle,

emission intensities, which again will have implications
for the scope of the mitigation challenge. Seen in a longer-

emissions may change the climate so much that it is impossible

occur. For example, there is a quasi-certain irreversibility of
a millennia time scale in the presence, in the atmosphere, of
22% of the emitted CO, (Solomon ef al., 2007). However, the
speed and nature of these changes, the tipping point at which

"Just as there are risks of irreversible climate changes,
decisions to reduce GHG emissions can require actions that are
essentially irreversible. For example, once made, these long-
lived, large-scale investments in low-emission technologies are
irreversible. If the assumptions about future policies and the
directions of climate science on which these investments are
made prove to be wrong, they would become ‘stranded’ assets.
The risks (perceived by investors) associated with irreversibility
of this nature further complicate decision-making on abatement
action (Keller et al., 2004; Pindyck, 2002; Kolstad, 1996;
Sullivan ef al., 2006; Hamilton and Kenber, 2006).

bears), an ecological community or indigenous cultures are
problematic for many people. This also applies to assumptions
that decision-makers value economic (and other) gains and
losses symmetrically — that a dollar gained should always
assumed to be valued equally to one that is lost, and that it is
possible and appropriate to assume that the current generation’s
preferences will remain stable over time.
"	Text
"Without special actions by governments to overcome their
natural inertia, economic and social systems might delay too
long in reacting to climate risks, thus leading to irreversible
climate changes. Ambitious climate-protection goals would
require new investments (physical and intellectual) in climate-
friendly technologies (efficiency improvements, renewables,
nuclear power, carbon capture and storage), which are higher
in cost than current technologies or otherwise divert scarce
resources. From an economic point of view these investments
are essentially irreversible. As the scale of the investment and
the proportion of research and development costs increase, so
the private economic risks associated with irreversibility also
increase. Therefore, in the presence of uncertainty concerning
future policy towards GHG emission reduction, future carbon
prices or stabilization targets, investors are reluctant to undertake
large-scale irreversible investments (sunk costs) without some
form of upfront government support.

"The possibility of abrupt climate change and/or abrupt
changes in the earth system triggered by climate change, with
potentially catastrophic consequences, cannot be ruled out
(Meehl et al., 2007). Disintegration of the West Antarctic Ice
Sheet (See Meehl et al., 2007), ifit occurred, could raise sea level
by 4-6 metres over several centuries. A shutdown of the North
Atlantic Thermohaline Circulation (See Meehl et al., 2007)
could have far-reaching, adverse ecological and agricultural
consequences (See IPCC, 2007b, Chapter 17), although some
studies raise the possibility that the isolated, economic costs of
this event might not be as high as assumed (See Meehl et al.,
2007). Increases in the frequency of droughts (Salinger, 2005)
or a higher intensity of tropical cyclones (See Meehl et al.,

the release of carbon or methane from the terrestrial biosphere
and oceans (See Meehl et al., 2007), which would add to the
mitigation required.

"Recent literature drawing on experimental economics and
behavioural sciences suggests that these assumptions are an
incomplete description of the way in which humans really
make decisions. This literature suggests that preferences may
be lexicographical (i.e. it is not possible to ‘trade off’ between
different dimensions of alternative possible outcomes — there
may be an aversion at any ‘price’ to losing particular species,
ecosystems or communities), that attitudes to gains and losses
might not be symmetrical (losses valued more highly than gains
of an equivalent magnitude), and that low-probability extreme
outcomes are overweighted when making choices (Tversky
and Kahneman, 1992; Quiggin, 1982). This literature suggests
that under these circumstances the conventional decision
axiom of choosing the policy set that maximizes the expected
(monetary) value of the outcomes might not be appropriate.
Non-conventional decision criteria (e.g. avoiding policy sets
which imply the possibility, even if at a very low probability,
of specific unacceptable outcomes) might be required to make
robust decisions (Chichilnisky, 2000; Lempert and Schlesinger,

uncertainties will decrease with time — for example in relation
to the effectiveness of mitigation actions and the availability

— that it is possible to ‘trade off’ or compensate between
impacts on different values in a way that can be expressed in
monetary values, and that it is possible to ascertain estimates
of these ‘compensation’ values for non-market impacts, such
as air pollution, health and biodiversity. By definition, the
benefits and costs of climate change policies involve many of
such issues, so climate change economic analysis embodies a

and alternatives’ (Arrow et al., 1996a, referenced in Bell et
al., 2001). Integrated Assessment Models ([AMs) in particular
have improved greatly in terms of the richness with which they
represent the biophysical, social and economic systems and the
feedbacks between them. They have increasingly explored a
variety of decision rules or other means of testing alternative
policies. Without structured analysis it is extremely difficult, if
not impossible, to understand the possible effects of alternative
policy choices that face decision-makers. Structured analysis can
assist choices of preferred policies within interests (for example
at the national level) as well as negotiating outcomes between
interests (by making regional costs and benefits clearer).

"Communicating about risk and uncertainty is difficult
because uncertainty is multi-dimensional and there are different
practical and philosophical approaches to it. In this report, ‘risk’
is understood to mean the ‘combination of the probability of an
event and its consequences’, as defined in the risk management
standard ISO/IEC Guide 73 (2002). This definition allows a
variety of ways of combining probabilities and consequences,
one of which is expected loss, defined as the ‘product of
probability and loss’. The fundamental distinction between
‘risk’ and ‘uncertainty’ is as introduced by economist Frank
Knight (1921), that risk refers to cases for which the probability
of outcomes can be ascertained through well-established
theories with reliable complete data, while uncertainty refers to
situations in which the appropriate data might be fragmentary
or unavailable.

"Variants of the safe landing/tolerable windows/guard rails
approach emphasize the role of regional/national decision-
makers by providing them the opportunity to nominate
perceived unacceptable impacts of climate change (for their
region or globally), and the limit to tolerable socio-economic
costs of mitigation measures they would be prepared to accept
to avoid that damage (e.g. Toth 2004). Modelling efforts (in
an integrated assessment model linking climate and economic
variables, and with explicit assumptions about burden sharing
through emissions allocations and trading) are then directed
at identifying the sets of feasible mitigation paths — known as
‘emissions corridors’ — consistent with these constraints. To
the extent that there is some overlap between the acceptable
‘emissions corridors’, the conditions for agreement on
mitigation action do exist.

"Dealing effectively with the communication of risk and
uncertainty is an important goal for the scientific assessment
of long-term environmental policies. In IPCC assessment
reports, an explicit effort is made to enhance consistency in the
treatment of uncertainties through a report-wide coordination
effort to harmonize the concepts and vocabulary used. The
Third Assessment Report common guidelines to describe levels
of confidence were elaborated by Moss and Schneider (2000).
The actual application of this framework differed across the
three IPCC working groups and across chapters within the
groups. It led to consistent treatment of uncertainties within
Working Group I (focusing on uncertainties and probabilities,
see Sommerville et al., 2007, Section 1.6) and Working
Group II (focusing on risks and confidence levels, see IPCC,
2007b, Section 1.1), although consistency across these groups
was not achieved. The authors of Working Group III did not

to assess the urgency of action to prevent the risk of climatic change. Using these scenarios led the IPCC to report a range
of global warming over the next century from 1.4-5.8°C, without being able to report any likelihood considerations. This
range turned out to be controversial, as it dramatically revised the top-range value, which was previously 3.5°C. Yet some
combinations of values that lead to high emissions, such as high per-capita income growth and high population growth,

"How can we decide whether a risk is acceptable to society?
Cost-benefit analysis alone cannot represent all aspects of
climate change policy evaluation, and Section 2.2 on Decision-
making discusses a variety of tools. In the private sector,
another practical way to deal with these risks has been to pay
attention to the Value-At-Risk (VAR): in addition to using the
mean and the variance of the outcome, a norm is set on the
most unfavourable percentile (usually 0.05) of the distribution
of outcomes at a given future date.
"	Text
"However, in the language of cost-benefit analysis, an
acceptable risk means that its benefits to society exceed its
costs. The standard rule used by public and private decision-
makers in a wide variety of fields (from road safety to long-term
investments in the energy sector) is that a risk will be acceptable
if the expected net present value is positive. Arrow and Lind
(1970) justify this criterion when the policy’s benefits and costs
have known probabilities, and when agents can diversify their
own risk through insurance and other markets. For most of the
economic analysis of climate change, these assumptions are
disputable, and have been discussed in the economic literature.
"	Text
"Finally, Gollier (2001) suggests that a sophisticated
interpretation of the Precautionary Principle is compatible with
economic principles in general, and with cost-benefit analyses in
particular. The timing of the decision process and the resolution
of the uncertainty should be taken into account, in particular
when waiting before implementing a preventive action as an
option. Waiting, and thereby late reactions, yield a cost when
risks happen to be worse than initially expected, but yield an
option value and cost savings in cases where risks happen to
be smaller than expected. Standard dynamic programming
methods can be used to estimate these option values.
"	Text
"Second, in most instances, objective probabilities are
difficult to estimate. Furthermore, a number of climate change
impacts involve health, biodiversity, and future generations, and
the value of changes in these assets is difficult to capture fully
in estimates of economic costs and benefits (see Section 2.4
on costs). Where we cannot measure risks and consequences
precisely, we cannot simply maximize net benefits mechanically.
This does not mean that we should abandon the usefulness of
cost-benefit analysis, but it should be used as an input, among
others in climate change policy decisions. The literature on how
to account for ambiguity in the total economic value is growing,
even if there is no agreed standard.
"	Text
"In spite of scientific progress, there is still much uncertainty
about future climate change and its mitigation costs. Given
observed risk attitudes, the desirability of preventive efforts
should be measured not only by the reduction in the expected
(average) damages, but also by the value of the reduced risks
and uncertainties that such efforts yield. The difficulty is how
to value the societal benefits included in these risk reductions.
Uncertainty concerning mitigation costs adds an additional
level of difficulty in determining the optimal risk-prevention
strategies, since the difference between two independent
uncertain quantities is relatively more uncertain than related to
the individual.
"	Text
"First, risks associated with climate change cannot easily
be diversified using insurance and financial instruments.
Atmospheric events are faced by everyone at the same time
in the same region. This reduces the potential benefit of any
mutual risk-sharing agreement. A solution would be to share
risks internationally, but this is difficult to implement, and
its efficiency depends upon the correlation of the regional
damages. Inability to diversify risks, combined with the risk
aversion observed in most public and private decision-makers,
implies that there is an additional benefit to preventive efforts
coming from the reduced variability of future damages. If these
monetized damages are expressed as a percentage of GDP, the
marginal benefit of prevention can be estimated as the marginal
expected increase in GDP, with some adjustments for the
marginal reduction in the variance of damages.

"External costs: These typically arise when markets fail to
provide a link between the person who creates the ‘externality’
and the person who is affected by it, or more generally when
property rights for the relevant resources are not well defined.’
In the case of GHG emissions, those who will eventually suffer
from the impacts of climate change do not have a well-defined
‘property right’ in terms of a given climate or an atmosphere
with given GHG concentrations, so market forces and/or
bargaining arrangements cannot work directly as a means to
balance the costs and benefits of GHG emissions and climate
change. However, the failure to take into account external costs,
in cases like climate change, may be due not only to the lack of
property rights, but also the lack of full information and non-
zero transaction costs related to policy implementation.
"	Text
"Private, financial, and social costs are estimated on the basis
of different prices. The private cost component is generally
based on market prices that face individuals. Thus, if a project
involves an investment of US$ 5 million, as estimated by the
inputs of land, materials, labour and equipment, that figure is
used as the private cost. That may not be the full cost, however,
as far as the estimation of social cost is concerned, because
markets can be distorted by regulations and other policies as
well as by limited competition that prevent prices from reflecting
real resource scarcities. If, for example, the labour input is
being paid more than its value in alternative employment, the
private cost is higher than the social cost. Conversely, if market
prices of polluting fuels do not include values that reflect the
environmental costs, these prices will be lower than the social
cost. Social costs should be based on market prices, but with
eventual adjustments of these with shadow prices, to bring
them into line with opportunity costs.

on technologies covers their technical characteristics,
especially evidence on learning curves as the technology
diffuses and matures. The technology analysis can use

a ‘partial-equilibrium’ context, for which other sectors and
macro-economic variables are assumed to be given. The
policies can include economic instruments related to prices,
taxes, trade, and financing, specific large-scale investment
projects, and demand-side regulation efforts. Methodological
frameworks for sectoral assessments include various partial
equilibrium models and technical simulation models for the
energy sector, agriculture, forestry, and the transportation

the impacts of policies across all sectors and markets.
The policies include all sorts of economic policies, such
as taxes, subsidies, monetary policies, specific investment
programmes, and technology and innovation policies.
Methodological frameworks include various macro-

"The debate on discount rates is a long-standing one. As the
SAR (Second Assessment Report) notes (IPCC, 1996, Chapter

and a descriptive approach based on what rates of discount
people (savers as well as investors) actually apply in their day-
to-day decisions. Investing in a project where the return is less
than the standard interest rate makes the investor poorer. This
descriptive approach based on a simple arbitrage argument
justifies using the after-tax interest rate as the discount rate.
The SAR notes that the former leads to relatively low rates of
discount (around 2-3% in real terms) and the latter to relatively
higher rates (at least 4% after tax and, in some cases, very much
higher rates). The importance of choosing different levels of

smallest possible value. Newell and Pizer (2004) arrived at a
similar conclusion. It is important to observe that this declining
rate comes on top of the variable short-term discount rate,
which should be frequently adapted to the conditions of the
market interest rate.

"For discounting over very long time horizons (e.g. periods
beyond 30 years), an emerging literature suggests that the
discount rate should decrease over time. Different theoretical
positions advocate for such an approach based on arguments
concerning the uncertainty of future discount rates and economic

and on observed individual choices of discount rates (Oxera,

compensate for risk. However, the descriptive approach has
several drawbacks. First, it relies on the assumption of efficient
financial markets, which is not a credible assumption, both as a
result of market frictions and the inability of future generations
to participate in financial markets over these time horizons.
Second, financial markets do not offer liquid riskless assets
for time horizons exceeding 30 years, which implies that the
interest rates for most maturities relevant for the climate change
problem cannot be observed.

"Despite theoretical disputes about the use of time-declining
discount rates, the UK government has officially recommended
such rates for official approval of projects with long-term
impacts. The recommendation here is to use a 3.5% rate for
1-30 years, a 3% rate for 31-75 years, a 2.5% rate for 76-125
years, a 2% rate for 125-200 years, 1.5% for 201-300 years, and
1% for longer periods (Oxera, 2002). Similarly, France decided
in 2004 to replace its constant discount rate of 8% with a 4%
discount rate for maturities below 30 years, and a discount rate
that decreases to 2% for longer maturities.!! Finally, the US
government’s Office of Management and Budget recognizes the
possibility of declining rates (see appendix D of US, 2003).

"It is also important to link the long-term macro-economic
uncertainty with the uncertainty concerning the future benefits
of our current preventive investments. Obviously, it is efficient
to bias our efforts towards investments that perform particularly
well in the worse states (i.e., states in which the economy
collapses). The standard approach to tackle this is to add a
risk premium to the benefits of these investments rather than
to modify the discount rate, which should remain a universal
exchange rate between current and future sure consumption, for
the sake of comparability and transparency of the cost-benefit
analysis. Using standard financial price modelling, this risk
premium is proportional to the covariance between the future
benefit and the future GDP.

"It is important to remember that these rates discount
certainty-equivalent cash flows. This discussion does not solve
the question of how to compute certainty equivalents when the
project’s cash flows are uncertain. For climate change impacts,
the assumed long-term nature of the problem is the key issue
here. The benefits of reduced GHG emissions vary according
to the time of emissions reduction, with the atmospheric GHG
concentration at the reduction time, and with the total GHG
concentrations more than 100 years after the emissions reduction.
Because these benefits are only probabilistic, the standard cost-
benefit analysis can be adjusted with a transformation of the
random benefit into its certainty equivalent for each maturity.
In a second step, the flow of certainty-equivalent cash flows is
discounted at the rates recommended above.

"Whereas it seems reasonable in the above formula to use
a rate of growth of GDP per capita of g=1-2% for the next
decade, there is much more uncertainty about which growth
rate to use for longer time horizons. It is intuitive that, in the
long run, the existence of an uncertain growth should reduce
the discount rates for these distant time horizons. Calibrating
a normative model on this idea, Gollier (2002a, 2002b, 2004)
recommended using a decreasing term structure of discount
rate, from 5% in the short term to 2% in the long term. In an
equivalent model, but with different assumptions on the growth
process, Weitzman (1998, 2004) proposed using a zero discount
rate for time horizons around 50 years, with the discount rate
being negative for longer time horizons. These models are
in line with the important literature on the term structure of
interest rates, as initiated by Vasicek (1977) and Cox, Ingersoll
and Ross (1985). The main difference is the time horizon under
scrutiny, with a longer horizon allowing considerable more
general specifications for the stochastic process that drives the
shape of the yield curve.

"et al., 2000; Vine et al., 2003). This can also reduce private
costs overall.

Co-benefits: Climate change mitigation measures will have
effects on other societal issues. For example, reducing carbon
emissions will often result in the simultaneous reduction in
local and regional air pollution (Dessues and O’Connor,
2003; Dudek et al., 2003; Markandya and Rubbelke, 2004;
Gielen and Chen, 2001; O’Connor ef al., 2003). It is likely
that mitigation strategies will also affect transportation,
agriculture, land-use practices and waste management and
will have an impact on other issues of social concern, such
as employment, and energy security. However, not all of
these effects will be positive; careful policy selection and
design can better ensure positive effects and minimize
negative impacts. In some cases, the magnitude of co-
benefits of mitigation may be comparable to the costs of
the mitigating measures, adding to the no-regrets potential,
although estimates are difficult to make and vary widely.3
Double dividend: Instruments (such as taxes or auctioned
permits) provide revenues to the government. If used to
finance reductions in existing distortionary taxes (‘revenue
recycling’), these revenues reduce the economic cost of
achieving greenhouse gas reductions. The magnitude of
this offset depends on the existing tax structure, type of tax
cuts, labour market conditions, and method of recycling
(Bay and Upmann, 2004; Chiroleu-Assouline and Fodha,
2005; Murray, et al., 2005). Under some circumstances, it is
possible that the economic benefits may exceed the costs of
mitigation. Contrary, it has also been argued that eventual
tax distortions should be eliminated anyway, and that the
benefits of reducing these therefore cannot be assigned as a
benefit of GHG emission reduction policies.

of social impacts are involved that go beyond the scope of what
is reflected in current market prices. These include impacts
on human health, nature conservation, biodiversity, natural

to ecosystems. Furthermore, complicated valuation issues
arise in relation to both market- and non-market areas, since
climate change policies involve impacts over very long time
horizons, where future generations are affected, as well as intra-
generational issues, where relatively wealthy and relatively poor
countries face different costs and benefits of climate change
impacts, adaptation and mitigation policies. Valuation of climate

of avoided emissions, compared with baseline emissions. The
given cost per tonne (or “unit cost’) is usually within a range
of monetary values at a particular location (e.g. for wind-
generated electricity), such as costs less than x US$ per tonne
of CO,- or carbon-equivalent reduction (US$/tC-eq). The
monetary values can be defined as private or social unit costs:
private unit costs are based on market prices, while social unit
costs reflect market prices, but also take externalities associated
with the mitigation into consideration. The prices are real prices
adjusted for inflation rates.

of life, the avoided costs of health care, or in relation to the
value of human capital on the labour market. Applications
of valuation techniques that involve estimating the statistical

reflect people in a fair and meaningful way, even with very
different income levels around the world. There are obviously
a lot of ethical controversies involved in valuing human health

Including behaviour and lifestyle changes.

The TAR (IPCC, 2001), p. 352 defines market potential as ‘the amount of GHG mitigation that might be expected to occur under forecast market conditions, with no changes
in policy or implementation of measures whose primary purpose is the mitigation of GHGs’. This definition might be interpreted to imply that market potential includes no
implementation of GHG policies. However many European countries have already implemented mitigation policies. It is a substantial research exercise in counterfactual analysis
to untangle the effects of past mitigation policies in the current levels of prices and costs and hence mitigation potential. The proposed definition simply clarifies this point.
IPCC (2001), Chapter 5 defines ‘economic potential’ as ‘the level of GHG mitigation that could be achieved if all technologies that are cost-effective from the consumers’ point
of view were implemented’ (p. 352). This definition therefore introduces the concept of the consumer as distinct from the market. This is deeply confusing because it loses the
connection with market valuations without explanation. Who is to decide how the consumers’ point of view is different from the market valuation of costs? On what basis are
they to choose these costs? The definition also does not explicitly introduce the social cost of carbon and other non-market valuations necessary to account for externalities
and missing markets and it is not readily comparable with the IPCC (2001), Chapter 3 definition of economic potentials. The proposed definition for this report applies to the
large body of relevant literature that assesses mitigation potential at different values of the social cost of carbon, and clearly introduces non-market valuations for externalities
and time preferences. The proposed definition also matches that actually used in IPCC (2001) Chapter 3, where such potentials are discussed ‘at zero social cost’ (e.g. p. 203).

capital is a cause, or simply a symptom, of a progressive and

uncertain such as surprises and other climate irreversibility,
should be included. Without taking these uncertain events into
consideration, decision-makers will tend to be more willing
to accept prospective future risks rather than attempt to avoid
them through abatement. It is worth noting here that,when
faced with the risk of a major damage, human beings may
make their judgment based on the consequences of the damage
rather than on probabilities of events. Schneider concludes
that it is not clear that climate surprises have a low probability,
they are just very uncertain at present, and he suggests taking
these uncertainties into consideration in integrated assessment
models, by adjusting the climate change damage estimates.
The adjustments suggested include using historical data for
estimating the losses of extreme events, valuing ecosystem
services, subjective probability assessments of monetary
damage estimates, and the use of a discount rate that decreases
over time in order to give high values to future generations.

economic terms — increase in Gross National Income (GNI) per

distribution has been one of the key components in equity, both
within and between countries, and has been measured in terms
of inequalities of income, through measures such as the “GINI’
coefficient.!9 20 Although a great deal has been written in
recent years on the components of well-being, the development
literature has been slow to adopt a broader set of indicators
of this concept, especially as far as equity in well-being is
concerned, despite the fact that some authors have argued that
absolute changes in income and other indicators of human well-

national income (GNI) and life expectancy at birth (LE) and
from 1990 to 2001 for the literacy rate (ILL). The increase in
average GNI has been much faster over this period than those
of life expectancy and literacy rates. The increase in coefficient
of variations for GNI per capita (by 6%) and life expectancy (by
14%) therefore show an increase in dispersion over this period,
indicating a wider disparity of these parameters across countries.
However, literacy rates have become more equal, with a decline
in the coefficient of variation by 22% (see Table 2.3). However,
a study by Goklany (2002) concluded that inequality between

implications of climate change uncertainty, where he considers
risk aversion for different income groups. The proposition
(generally supported by empirical evidence) is that the relative
risk aversion of individuals decreases with increasing wealth
(Gollier, 2001), implying that the compensation that an
individual asks for in order to accept a risk decreases relative to
his income with increasing income. However, the absolute risk
aversion — or the total compensation required in order to accept
a risk — increases with wealth. It means that a given absolute
risk level is considered to be more important to poorer people
than to richer, and the comparatively higher risk aversion of
poorer people suggests that larger investments in climate
change mitigation and adaptation policies are preferred if these
risks are borne by the poor rather than the rich.

"This wider analysis of equity has important implications for
sharing the costs of mitigation and for assessing the impacts of
climate change (see Chapter | for a more detailed discussion
of climate change impacts and the reference to the UNFCCC

are distributed very unequally across the planet, hurting the
vulnerable and poor countries of the tropics much more than
the richer countries in the temperate regions. Moreover, these
impacts do not work exclusively, or even mainly, through
changes in real incomes. The well-being of future generations
will be affected through the effects of climate change on health,
economic insecurity and other factors. As far as the costs of
actions to reduce GHGs are concerned, measures that may be
the least costly in overall terms are often not the ones that are
the most equitable — see Sections 2.6.4 and 2.6.5 for a further
discussion of the links between mitigation policy and equity.

"This approach has been the backbone of welfare economics,
including the use of cost-benefit analysis (CBA) as a tool
for selecting between options. Under CBA all benefits are
added up, as are the costs, and the net benefit — the difference
between the benefits and costs — is calculated. The option with
the highest net benefit is considered the most desirable.2? If
utilities were proportional to money benefits and ‘disutilities’
were proportional to money costs, this method would amount
to choosing to maximize utilities. Since most economists accept
that this proportionality does not hold, they extend the CBA
by either (a) asking the decision-maker to take account of the
distributional implications of the option as a separate factor, in
addition to the calculated net benefit; or (b) weighting costs or
benefits by a factor that reflects the relationship between utility
and the income of the person receiving that cost or benefit. For
details of these methods in the context of climate change, see

"Sen criticizes the ‘rights-based’ equity approaches for not
taking into consideration the fact that individuals are different
and the actual consequences of giving them specific rights will
vary between individuals, so rights should be seen in the context

preferences and thereby value primary inputs, for example,
differently, and because their capability to use different rights
also differ. Along these lines, Sen further argues that his
capability-based approach can facilitate easier inter-personal
comparisons than utilitarianism, since it does not suggest
aggregating all individuals, but rather presenting information
both on the capability sets available to individuals and their
actual achievements.

"More recently, however, some ethical philosophers have
found fault with both the ‘modified’ utilitarian view and
the rights-based approach, on a number of grounds. Sen, for
example, has argued that options should be judged not only in
terms of their consequences, but also in terms of procedures. He
advocates a focus on the capabilities of individuals to choose a
life that one has reason to value. A person’s capability refers to the
alternative combinations of ‘functionings’, where functionings
can be more popularly described as ‘lifestyles’ (Sen, 1999, pp.
74-75). What matters are not only the realized functionings,
but also the capability set of alternatives, differently from a
utilitarian-based approach that focuses only on the outcomes. In
particular, the freedom to make the choices and engage in social
and market transactions is worth something in its own right.

"As suggested above, societies do not (in practice) follow
a strict utilitarian view of social justice and they do indeed
recognize that citizens have certain basic rights in terms of
housing, medical care etc. Equally, they do not subscribe to a
clear ‘rights’ view of social justice either. Social choices are
then a compromise between a utilitarian solution that focuses
on consequences and one that recognizes basic rights in a more
fundamental way. Much of the political and philosophical
debate is about which rights are valid in this context — a debate
that shows little sign of resolution. For climate change there
are many options that need to be evaluated, in terms of their
consequences for the lives of individuals who will be impacted
by them. It is perfectly reasonable for the policymakers to
exclude those that would result in major social disruptions, or
large number of deaths, without recourse to a CBA. Equally,
choices that avoid such negative consequences can be regarded
as essential, even if the case for them cannot be made on CBA
grounds. Details of where such rules should apply and where
choices can be left to the more conventional CBA have yet to
be worked out, and this remains an urgent part of the agenda for
climate change studies.

proposed. This would give more emissions rights to developing
countries — more than the level of GHGs they currently emit.
Hence such a rights-based allocation would impose more
significant costs on the industrialized countries, although now,
as emissions in the developing world increased, they too, at
some point in time, would have to undertake some emissions

a utilitarian basis, assuming declining marginal utility, the case
for the richer countries undertaking more of the burden is strong
— they are the ones to whom the opportunity cost of such actions
would have less welfare implications. However, assuming
constant marginal utility, one could come to the conclusion that
the costs of climate change mitigation that richer countries will
face are very large compared with the benefits of the avoided
climate change damages in poorer countries. In this way,
utilitarian-based approaches can lead to different conclusions,

"Recognizing the importance of technology over the long-

the climate change debate, as direction and pace of future
technological change cannot be predicted. Technological
innovation and deployment are responsive to climate policy
signals, for example in form of carbon taxes, although the extent
and rate of this response can be as uncertain as the timing and
magnitude of the policy signal. Reducing such uncertainties,
for instance through long-term, predictable policy frameworks
and signals, are therefore important. The usual approach
consists of formulating alternative scenarios of plausible future
developments. These, however, are constrained by inherent
biases in technology assessment and uncertainties concerning
the response of technological change to climate policy. There
is also widespread recognition in the literature that it is highly
unlikely that a single ‘silver bullet’ technology exists that can
solve the climate problem, so the issue is not one of identifying
singular technologies, but rather ensembles, or portfolios of
technologies. This applies to both mitigation and adaptation
technologies. These technologies have inter-dependencies and
cross-enhancement (‘spillover’) potentials, which adds another
important element of uncertainty into the analysis. Despite these
problems of uncertainty and ignorance, insights are available

"While the importance of technology to climate change
is widely understood, there are differing viewpoints on the
feasibility of current technology to address climate change
and the role of new technology. On the one hand, Hoffert
et al. (2002) and others have called for a major increase in
research funding now to develop innovative technological
options because, in this view, existing technologies cannot
achieve the deep emission cuts that could be needed to mitigate
future change. On the other hand, Pacala and Socolow (2004)
advance the view that a range of known current technologies
could be deployed, starting now and over the next 50 years, to
place society on track to stabilize CO, concentrations at 500
+ 50 parts per million. In their view, research for innovative
technology is needed but only to develop technologies that
might be used in the second half of the century and beyond.
Still a third viewpoint is that the matter is better cast in terms
of cost, in addition to technical feasibility (e.g. Edmonds et al.,
1997; Edmonds, 2004; Nakicenovic and Riahi, 2002) From this
viewpoint, today’s technology is, indeed, sufficient to bring
about the requisite emissions reductions, but the underlying
question is not technical feasibility but the degree to which
resources would need to be reallocated from other societal
goals (e.g. health care, education) to accommodate emissions
mitigation. The role of new technology, in this view, is to lower
the costs to achieve societal goals.

"Perhaps the most exhaustive examination of the influence
of technological uncertainty to date is the modelling study
reported by Gritsevskyi and Nakicenovic (2000). Their model
simulations, consisting of 130,000 scenarios that span a carbon
emission range of 6 to 33 GtC by 2100 (Figure 2.1), provided
a systematic exploration of contingent uncertainties of long-
term technological change spanning a comparable range of
future emissions as almost the entirety of the no-climate policy
emissions scenario literature (see Chapter 3 for an update of
the scenario literature). The study also identified some 13,000
scenarios (out of an entire scenario ensemble of 130,000)
regrouped into a set of 53 technology dynamics that are all
‘optimal’ in the sense that they satisfy the same cost minimum
in the objective function, but with a bimodal distribution in
terms of emissions outcomes. In other words, considering full
endogenous technological uncertainty produces a pattern of
“technological lock-in’ into alternatively low or high emissions
futures that are equal in terms of their energy systems costs.

"The importance of technological change for future GHG
emission levels and hence the magnitude of possible climate
change has been recognized ever since the earliest literature
reviews (Ausubel and Nordhaus, 1983). Subsequent important
literature assessments (e.g. Alcamo ef al., 1995; Nakicenovic et
al., 1998b; Edmonds et al., 1997; SRES, 2000) have examined
the impact of alternative technology assumptions on future
levels of GHG emissions. For instance, the SRES (2000)
report concluded technology to be of similar importance for
future GHG emissions as population and economic growth
combined. A conceptual simple illustration of the importance of
technology is provided by comparing individual GHG emission
scenarios that share comparable assumptions on population and
economic growth, such as in the Low Emitting Energy Supply
Systems (LESS) scenarios developed for the IPCC SAR (1996)
or within the IPCC SRES (2000) Al scenario family, where for
a comparable level of energy service demand, the (no-climate-
policy) scenarios span a range of between 1038 (AIT) and
2128 (A1FI) GtC cumulative (1990-2100) emissions, reflecting
different assumptions on availability and development of
low- versus high-emission technologies. Yet another way of
illustrating the importance of technology assumptions in baseline
scenarios is to compare given scenarios with a hypothetical
baseline in which no technological change is assumed to occur

differences that have arisen with respect to feasibility and
costs of emission reductions between two broad categories of
modelling approaches: ‘bottom-up’ engineering-type models

economic benefits, depending on the adoption of best-available

another important finding related to technology economics
emerges from the available literature. Differences in the
cost of meeting a prescribed CO, concentration target across
alternative technology development pathways that could unfold
in the absence of climate policies are more important than cost
differences between alternative stabilization levels within
a given technology-reference scenario. In other words, the

tenths of a percent of GDP, or even lower (in some models
even becoming negative) — a finding also confirmed by other

the results of the study by Gritsevskyi and Nakicenovic (2000)
reviewed above, which also showed identical costs of ‘high’

Edmonds et al. (1997) and Gerlagh and Van der Zwaan (2003).
Cost differences are generally much larger between alternative
technology baselines, characterized by differing assumptions
concerning availability and costs of technologies, rather than
between alternative stabilization levels. The IEA (2004) World

the differential investment patterns entailed by alternative

These drivers are distinctly different?! from other mechanisms
that influence the costs of a given technology, such as. through
economies of scale effects (see Box 2.3 below). Each of these

"These two processes are inextricably tied. The set of available
technology defines what might be deployed, and the use of
technology affords learning that can guide R&D programmes
or directly improve technology through learning-by-doing. The
two processes are also linked temporally. The set of technologies
that find their way into use necessarily lags the technological
frontier. The useful life of technologies — their natural turnover
rate — helps to drive the time relationship. Car lifespans can
be in the order of 15 years, but the associated infrastructure
—roads, filling stations, vehicle manufacturing facilities — have
significantly longer lifespans, and electric power plants may
be used for a half-century or more; hence, the average car is
substantially younger than the average coal-fired power plant
and much of its associated infrastructure. The nature of the
capital stock (e.g. flexifuel cars that can use both conventional
petrol and ethanol) is also important in determining diffusion
speed.

"A second defining characteristic of technological change
is the transferable, public-good nature of knowledge. Once
created, the value of technological knowledge is difficult
to fully appropriate; some or all eventually spills over to
others, and in doing so the knowledge is not depleted. This
characteristic of knowledge has both benefits and drawbacks.
On the one hand, an important discovery by a single individual,
such as penicillin, can be utilized worldwide. Knowledge of
penicillin is a public good and therefore one person’s use of this
knowledge does not preclude another person from using this
same knowledge — unlike for capital or labour, where use in one
task precludes use in an alternative task. On the other hand, the
understanding by potential innovators that any new knowledge
might eventually spill over to others limits expected profits
and therefore dampens private-sector innovative activity. Thus
intellectual property rights can serve both as a barrier and an
aid in technology change. A final, third feature of technological
change is its cumulativeness, which is also frequently related to
spillover effects.

(see Cohen and Levinthal, 1989). The opportunities created
by spillovers are one of the primary sources of knowledge
that underlies innovation (see Klevorick, et al., 1995). There
are different channels by which innovativions may spillover.
For instance, the productivity achieved by a firm or an industry
depends not only on its own R&D effort, but also on the pool
of general knowledge to which it has access. There are also
so-called ‘rent spillovers’, such as R&D leading to quality
changes embodied in new and improved outputs which not
necessarily yield higher prices. Finally, spillovers are frequent
for products with high market rivalry effects (e.g. through

of scale are not a source of technological advance, but rather a characteristic of production. However, the two concepts

of scale. It is for this reason that economies of scale have often been used as a justification for using experience curves or

that firms are unable to fully appropriate the benefits of their
R&D), and large spillover benefits. Griliches (1992) writes that
“... there have been a significant number of reasonably well
done studies all pointing in the same direction: R&D spillovers
are present, their magnitude may be quite large, and social rates
of return remain significantly above private rates’.

"A number of studies have attempted to probe more deeply
into the sources of advance underlying these correlations
(see, for example, Rapping, 1965; Lieberman, 1984; Hirsh,
1956; Zimmerman, 1982; Joskow and Rose, 1985; Soderholm
and Sundqvist, 2003, and Nemet, 2005). On the whole, these
studies continue to support the presence of learning-by-doing
effects, but also make clear that other sources can also be
important and can influence the learning rate. This conclusion
is also confirmed by recent studies following a so-called ‘two-
factor-learning-curve’ hypothesis that incorporates both R&D
and cumulative production volume as drivers of technological
advance within a production function framework (see, for
example, Kouvaritakis et al., 2000). However, Soderholm and
Sundqvist (2003) conclude that ‘the problem of omitted variable
bias needs to be taken seriously’ in this type of approach, in
addition to empirical difficulties that arise, because of the
absence of public and private sector technology-specific R&D
statistics and due to significant co-linearity and auto-correlation
of parameters (e.g. Miketa and Schrattenholzer, 2004).
"	Text
"An important methodological issue arising in the use of
these curves is that the statistical correlations on which they
are based do not address the causal relationships underlying
the correlations between cumulative production and declining
costs, and few studies address the uncertainties inherent in any
learning phenomenon (including negative learning). Because
these curves often consider technologies over long time frames
and many stages of technology evolution, they must incorporate
the full range of sources that might affect technological advance
or costs and performance more generally, including economies
of scale, changes in industry structure, own-industry R&D,
and spillovers from other industries and from government
R&D. Together, these sources of advance reduce costs, open
up larger markets, and result in increasing cumulative volume
(see Ghemawat, 1985; Day and Montgomery, 1983; Alberts,
1989; Soderholm and Sundqvist, 2003). Hence, the causal
relationships necessarily operate both from cumulative volume
to technological advance and from technological advance to
cumulative volume.

"The behaviour of competing firms plays a key role in the
innovation process. Especially in their efforts to develop and
introduce new non-commercial technology into a sustainable
commercial operations, firms require not only the ability to
innovate and to finance costly hardware, but also the managerial
and technical skills to operate them and successfully market the
products, particularly in the early stages of deployment and
diffusion. The development of proprietary intellectual property
and managerial know-how are key ingredients in establishing
competitive advantage with new technology, but they can be
costly and difficult to sustain.
"	Text
"More broadly, these studies, along with related theoretical
work, suggest the need for further exploration of the drivers
behind technological advance and the need to develop more
explicit models of the interactions between sources. For
example, while the two-factor-learning-curves include both
R&D and cumulative volume as drivers, they often assume a
substitutability of the two forms of knowledge generation that
is at odds with the (by now widely accepted) importance of
feedback effects between ‘supply push’ and ‘demand pull’
drivers of technological change (compare Freeman, 1994).
Hence, while modelling paradigms such as two-factor-learning-
curves might be valuable methodological steps on the modelling
front, they remain largely exploratory. For a (critical) discussion
and suggestion for an alternative approach see, for example,
Otto et al., 2005.

"Development and diffusion or commercialization of new
technology is largely a private-sector endeavour driven by
market incentives. The public sector can play an important
role in coordination and co-funding of these activities and
(through policies) in structuring market incentives. Firms
choose to develop and deploy new technologies to gain
market advantages that lead to greater profits. Technological
change comprises a whole host of activities that include R&D,
innovations, demonstration projects, commercial deployment
and widespread use, and involves a wide range of actors
ranging from academic scientists and engineers, to industrial
research labs, consultants, firms, regulators, suppliers and
customers. When creating and disseminating revolutionary
(currently non-existent) technologies, the path to development
may proceed sequentially through the various phases, but for
existing technology, interactions can occur between all phases,
for example, studies of limitations in currently deployed
technologies may spark innovation in fundamental academic
research. The ability to identify and exploit advances in unrelated
fields (advanced diagnostics and probes, computer monitoring
and modelling, control systems, materials and fabrication) is
one of the prime drivers of innovation and improvement. Such
advances draw from an enabling environment that supports
education, research and industrial capacity.
"	Text
"A range of additional lines of research has explored the
sources of technological advance. Authors have pursued the
impacts of ‘general-purpose technologies’, suchas rotary motion
(Bresnahan and Trajtenberg, 1992), electricity and electric
motors (Rosenberg, 1982), chemical engineering (Rosenberg,
1998), and binary logic and computers (Bresnahan and
Trajtenberg, 1992). Klevorick et al. (1995) explored the sources
of technological opportunity that firms exploit in advancing
technology, finding important roles for a range of knowledge
sources, depending on the industry and the application. Anumber
of authors (see, for example, Jaffe and Palmer 1996; Lanjouw
and Mody 1996; Taylor et a/., 2003; Brunnermier and Cohen,
2003; Newell et al. 1998) have explored the empirical link
between environmental regulation and technological advance
in environmental technologies. This body of literature indicates
an important relationship between environmental regulation
and innovative activity on environmental technologies.
On the other hand, this literature also indicates that not all
technological advance can be attributed to the response to
environmental regulation. Finally, there has been a long line of
empirical research exploring whether technological advance is
induced primarily through the appearance of new technological
opportunities (technology-push) or through the response to
perceived market demand (market pull). (See, for example,
Schmookler, 1962; Langrish ef a/., 1972; Myers and Marquis,
1969; Mowery and Rosenberg, 1979; Rosenberg 1982; Mowery
and Rosenberg, 1989; Utterback, 1996; Rycroft and Kash 1999).
Over time, a consensus has emerged that ‘the old debate about
the relative relevance of “technology push” versus “market
pull” in delivering new products and processes has become an
anachronism. In many cases one cannot say with confidence that
either breakthroughs in research “‘cause” commercial success
or that the generation of successful products or processes was
a predictable “effect” of having the capability to read user
demands or other market signals accurately’ (Rycroft and Kash,
1999).

"One consequence of the long time scales involved with energy
technology is that, at any point in time, there will inevitably
be a significant spread in the efficiency and performance
of the existing equipment deployed. While this presents an
opportunity for advanced technology to reduce emissions,
the overall investment required to prematurely replace a
significant fraction of sunk capital can be prohibitive. Another
consequence of the long time scale and high cost of equipment
is that it is difficult to discern long-term technological winners
and losers in evolving markets.
"	Text
"Another factor is that the lengthy timescale for deployment
of advanced energy technologies has a substantive impact on
private-sector behaviour. Even with successful innovation
in energy technology, the time necessary for new technology
to make a widespread global impact on emissions will be
lengthy. Timescales are long, both due to the long lifespan of
existing productive capital stock, and the major investment
in hardware and infrastructure that is required for significant
market penetration. During the time that advanced technology
is being deployed, both incremental and revolutionary changes
may occur in the technologies under consideration, and in those
that compete with them.

"Two market failures are at issue when developing policies
to stimulate technology development. The first is the failure to
internalize the environmental costs of climate change, reducing
the demand for climate-friendly technologies and thereby
reducing private-sector innovation incentives and learning-by-
doing. The second is a broad suite of private-sector innovation
market failures that hold back and otherwise distort private-
sector investment in technological advance, irrespective of
environmental concerns (confer Jaffe et al., 2005). Chief among
these is the inability to appropriate the benefits of knowledge
creation. From an economic standpoint, two market failures
require two policy instruments: addressing two market failures
with a single instrument will only lead to second-best solutions
(see, for example, Goulder and Schneider, 1999). Hence, itis well
understood that the optimal policy approach should include both
technology-push and demand-pull instruments. While patents
and various intellectual property protection (e.g. proprietary
know-how) seeks to reward innovators, such protection is
inherently imperfect, especially in global markets where such
protections are not uniformly enforced by all governments.

"Given the importance of technology in determining both the
magnitude of future GHG emission levels as well as feasibility
and costs of emission reduction efforts, technology policy
considerations are increasingly considered in climate policy
analyses. Ongoing debate centers on the relative importance
of two differing policy approaches: technology-push (through
efforts to stimulate research and development) and demand-pull
(through measures that demand reduced emissions or enhanced
efficiency). Technology-push emphasizes the role of policies
that stimulate research and development, especially those
aimed at lowering the costs of meeting long-term objectives
with technology that today is very far from economic in
existing markets. This might include such measures as public-
funded R&D or R&D tax credits. Demand-pull emphasizes the
use of instruments to enhance the demand for lower-emission
technologies, thereby increasing private incentives to improve
these technologies and inducing any learning-by-doing effects.
Demand-pull instruments might include emissions taxes or
more direct approaches, such as renewable portfolio standards,
adoption subsidies, or direct public-sector investments (see
Figure 2.3).

combinations of instruments and around how effective single-
policy approaches might be. Within this context, a number

that fundamental long-term shifts in technology to mitigate
greenhouse gas emissions cannot be achieved through
emissions-constraining policies alone, and short-term cap and
trade emission-reduction policies provide insufficient incentives
for R&D into long-term technology options. Conversely, Popp
(2002) demonstrated how energy R&D is responsive to price
signals, suggesting that without emissions constraints R&D
into new low-emission technologies may face a serious lack
of incentives and credible policy signals. The argument that
emissions-based policies will induce long-term technology

"innovation relies primarily on two lines of reasoning (Goulder
2004; Grubb, 2005). The first is that the anticipation of future
targets, based on a so-called announcement effect, will stimulate
firms to invest in research and development and ultimately to
invest in advanced, currently non-commercial technology (the
credibility and effectiveness of this effect, however, being
challenged by Montgomery and Smith, 2005). The second is
that early investment, perhaps through incentives, mandates, or
government procurement programmes, will initiate a cycle of
learning-by-doing that will ultimately promote innovation in
the form of continuous improvement, which will drive down the
cost of future investments in these technologies. This issue is
especially critical in the scaling up of niche-market applications
of new technologies (e.g. renewables) where mobilizing finance
and lowering investment risks are important (see, for example,
IEA, 2003, or Hamilton, 2005). In their comparative analysis
of alternative policy instruments Goulder and Schneider (1999)
found that when comparing a policy with only R&D subsidies
to an emissions tax, the emissions-based policies performed
substantially better.

"In climate mitigation studies, there are often two types
of regional breakdowns used — physio-geographic or socio-
economic. Data on insolation (relevant to solar power), rainfall
(relevant to hydrower), temperature, precipitation and soil type
(relevant to the potential for carbon sequestration) are examples
of physio-geographic classifications useful in climate change
mitigation studies.

"The multitude of possible regional representations hinders the
comparability and transfer of information between the various
types of studies implemented for specific regions and scales.
Data availability also determines what kinds of aggregation
are possible. Proxies are used when data is not available. This
report has generally chosen a pragmatic way of analyzing
regional information and presenting findings. Readers should
bear in mind that any regional classification masks sub-regional
differences.

"There is a clear and strong correlation between the
CO,-equivalent concentrations (or radiative forcing) of the
published studies and the CO,-only concentrations by 2100,
because CO, is the most important contributor to radiative
forcing. Based on this relationship, to facilitate scenario
comparison and assessment, stabilization scenarios (both multi-
gas and CO,-only studies) have been grouped in this chapter into
different categories that vary in the stringency of the targets, from

"In the debate on the use of exchange rates, market exchange
rates (MER) or purchasing power parities (PPP), evidence from
the limited number of new PPP-based studies indicates that the
choice of metric for gross domestic product (GDP), MER or
PPP, does not appreciably affect the projected emissions, when
metrics are used consistently. The differences, if any, are small
compared to the uncertainties caused by assumptions on other
parameters, e.g. technological change (high agreement, much
evidence).

"Baseline land-related CO, and non-CO, GHG emissions
remain significant, with continued but slowing land conversion
and increased use of high-emitting agricultural intensification
practices due to rising global food demand and shifts in
dietary preferences towards meat consumption. The post-
SRES scenarios suggest a degree of agreement that the decline
in annual land-use change carbon emissions will, over time,
be less dramatic (slower) than those suggested by many of
the SRES scenarios. Global long-term land-use scenarios
are scarce in numbers but growing, with the majority of the
new literature since the SRES contributing new forestry and

"Some studies find differences in emission levels between
using PPP-based and MER-based estimates. These results
critically depend on, among other things, convergence
assumptions (high agreement, medium evidence). In some of
the short-term scenarios (with a horizon to 2030) a ‘bottom-
up’ approach is taken, where assumptions about productivity
growth and investment and saving decisions are the main
drivers of growth in the models. In long-term scenario models,
a ‘top-down’ approach is more commonly used, where the
actual growth rates are more directly prescribed based on
convergence or other assumptions about long-term growth
potentials. Different results can also be due to inconsistencies
in adjusting the metrics of energy efficiency improvement when
moving from MER-based to PPP-based calculations.
"	Text
"This chapter documents baseline and stabilization scenarios
in the literature since the publication of the IPCC Special
Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) (Nakicenovic et al.,
2000) and Third Assessment Report (TAR, Morita et a/., 2001).
It reviews the use of the SRES reference and TAR stabilization
scenarios and compares them with new scenarios that have
been developed during the past five years. Of special relevance
is how ranges published for driving forces and emissions in the
newer literature compare with those used in the TAR, SRES
and pre-SRES scenarios. This chapter focuses particularly
on the scenarios that stabilize atmospheric concentrations of
greenhouse gases (GHGs). The multi-gas stabilization scenarios
represent a significant change in the new literature compared
to the TAR, which focused mostly on carbon dioxide (CO)
emissions. They also explore lower levels and a wider range of
stabilization than in the TAR.
"	Text
"The numerical expression of GDP clearly depends on
conversion measures; thus GDP expressed in PPP will deviate
from GDP expressed in MER, more so for developing countries.
The choice of conversion factor (MER or PPP) depends on the
type of analysis or comparison being undertaken. However,
when it comes to calculating emissions (or other physical
measures, such as energy), the choice between MER-based
or PPP-based representations of GDP should not matter, since
emission intensities will change (in a compensating manner)
when the GDP numbers change. Thus, if a consistent set of
metrics is employed, the choice of MER or PPP should not
appreciably affect the final emission levels (high agreement,
medium evidence). This supports the SRES in the sense that
the use of MER or PPP does not, in itself, lead to significantly
different emission projections outside the range of the literature
(high agreement, much evidence). In the case of the SRES, the
emissions trajectories were the same whether economic activities
in the four scenario families were measured in MER or PPP.
"	Text
"The foremost finding from the comparison of the SRES
and new scenarios in the literature is that the ranges of main
driving forces and emissions have not changed very much (high
agreement, much evidence). Overall, the emission ranges from
scenarios without climate policy reported before and after the
SRES have not changed appreciably. Some changes are noted
for population and economic growth assumptions. Population
scenarios from major demographic institutions are lower than
they were at the time of the SRES, but so far they have not been
fully implemented in the emissions scenarios in the literature. All
other factors being equal, lower population projections are likely
to result in lower emissions. However, in the scenarios that used
lower projections, changes in other drivers of emissions have
offset their impact. Regional medium-term (2030) economic
projections for some developing country regions are currently
lower than the highest scenarios used in the SRES. Otherwise,
economic growth perspectives have not changed much, even
though they are among the most intensely debated aspects of
the SRES scenarios. In terms of emissions, the most noticeable
changes occurred for projections of SO, and NO, emissions. As
short-term trends have moved down, the range of projections
for both is currently lower than the range published before the
SRES. A small number of new scenarios have begun to explore
emission pathways for black and organic carbon.

"Multi-gas emission-reduction scenarios are able to meet
climate targets at substantially lower costs compared to
CO,-only strategies (for the same targets, high agreement,
much evidence). Inclusion of non-CO, gases provides a more
diversified approach that offers greater flexibility in the timing
of the reduction programme.
"	Text
"The scenarios that report quantitative results with drastic
CO, reduction targets of 60-80% in 2050 (compared to today’s
emission levels) require increased rates of energy intensity and
carbon intensity improvement by 2-3 times their historical
levels. This is found to require different sets of mitigation
options across regions, with varying shares of nuclear energy,
carbon capture and storage (CCS), hydrogen, and biomass.
"	Text
"Decarbonization trends are persistent in the majority of
intervention and non-intervention scenarios (high agreement,
much evidence). The medians of scenario sets indicate
decarbonization rates of around 0.9 (pre-TAR) and 0.6
(post-TAR) compared to historical rates of about 0.3% per
year. Improvements of carbon intensity of energy supply and
the whole economic need to be much faster than in the past
for the low stabilization levels. On the upper end of the range,
decarbonization rates of up to 2.5% per year are observed in
more stringent stabilization scenarios, where complete transition
away from carbon-intensive fuels is considered.
"	Text
"The costs of stabilization crucially depend on the choice of
the baseline, related technological change and resulting baseline
emissions; stabilization target and level; and the portfolio of
technologies considered (high agreement, much evidence).
Additional factors include assumptions with regard to the use
of flexible instruments and with respect to revenue recycling.
Some literature identifies low-cost technology clusters that
allow for endogenous technological learning with uncertainty.
This suggests that a decarbonized economy may not cost any
more than a carbon-intensive one, if technological learning is
taken into account.
"	Text
"Long-term stabilization scenarios highlight the importance
of technology improvements, advanced technologies, learning-
by-doing, and induced technological change, both for achieving
the stabilization targets and cost reduction (high agreement,
much evidence). While the technology improvement and use of
advanced technologies have been employed in scenarios largely
exogenously in most of the literature, new literature covers
learning-by-doing and endogenous technological change.
The latter scenarios show different technology dynamics and
ways in which technologies are deployed, while maintaining
the key role of technology in achieving stabilization and cost
reduction.
"	Text
"The timing of emission reductions depends on the stringency
of the stabilization target. Lowest stabilization targets require
an earlier peak of CO, and CO,-equivalent emissions. In the
majority of the scenarios in the most stringent stabilization
category (a stabilization level below 490 ppmv CO,-equivalent),
emissions are required to decline before 2015 and are further
reduced to less than 50% of today’s emissions by 2050. For
somewhat higher stabilization levels (e.g. below 590 ppmv
CO,-equivalent) global emissions in the scenarios generally
peak around 2010-2030, followed by a return to 2000 levels, on
average around 2040. For high stabilization levels (e.g. below
710 ppmv CO,-equivalent) the median emissions peak around
2040 (high agreement, much evidence).
"	Text
"There are different metrics for reporting costs of emission
reductions, although most models report them in macro-
economic indicators, particularly GDP losses. For stabilization
at 4-5 W/m? (or ~ 590-710 ppmv CO,-equivalent) macro-
economic costs range from -1 to 2% of GDP below baseline in
2050. For a more stringent target of 3.5-4.0 W/m? (~ 535-590
ppmv CO,-equivalent) the costs range from slightly negative
to 4% GDP loss (high agreement, much evidence). GDP losses
in the lowest stabilization scenarios in the literature (445-535
ppmv CO,-equivalent) are generally below 5.5% by 2050,
however the number of studies are relatively limited and are
developed from predominantly low baselines (high agreement,
medium evidence).
"	Text
"Essentially, any specific concentration or radiative forcing
target, from the lowest to the highest, requires emissions to
eventually fall to very low levels as the removal processes of
the ocean and terrestrial systems saturate. For low to medium
targets, this would need to occur during this century, but higher
stabilization targets can push back the timing of such reductions
to beyond 2100. However, to reach a given stabilization target,
emissions must ultimately be reduced well below current levels.
For achievement of the very low stabilization targets from many
high baseline scenarios, negative net emissions are required
towards the end of the century. Mitigation efforts over the next
two or three decades will have a large impact on opportunities
to achieve lower stabilization levels (high agreement, much
evidence).
"	Text
"Including land-use mitigation options as abatement strategies
provides greater flexibility and cost-effectiveness for achieving
stabilization (high agreement, medium evidence). Even if
land activities are not considered as mitigation alternatives
by policy, consideration of land (land-use and land cover) is
crucial in climate stabilization for its significant atmospheric
inputs and withdrawals (emissions, sequestration, and albedo).
Recent stabilization studies indicate that land-use mitigation
options could provide 15—40% of total cumulative abatement
over the century. Agriculture and forestry mitigation options are
projected to be cost-effective abatement strategies across the
entire century. In some scenarios, increased commercial biomass
energy (solid and liquid fuel) is a significant abatement strategy,
providing 5—30% of cumulative abatement and potentially
1-15% of total primary energy over the century.
"	Text
"Decisions to delay emission reductions seriously constrain
opportunities to achieve low stabilization targets (e.g. stabilizing
concentrations from 445-535 ppmv CO,-equivalent), and raise
the risk of progressively more severe climate change impacts
and key vulnerabilities occurring.
"	Text
"at 535-590 ppmv CO,-equivalent could limit the increase to
2.8-3.2°C above the pre-industrial level and those at 590-710
CO,-equivalent to 3.2-4°C, requiring emissions to peak within
the next 25 and 55 years, respectively (high agreement, medium
evidence).
"	Text
"The risk of climate feedbacks is generally not included in
the above analysis. Feedbacks between the carbon cycle and
climate change affect the required mitigation for a particular
stabilization level of atmospheric CO, concentration. These
feedbacks are expected to increase the fraction of anthropogenic
emissions that remains in the atmosphere as the climate system
warms. Therefore, the emission reductions to meet a particular
stabilization level reported in the mitigation studies assessed
here might be underestimated.
"	Text
"For any given stabilization pathway, a higher climate
sensitivity raises the probability of exceeding temperature
thresholds for key vulnerabilities (high agreement, much

highest values of climate sensitivity (i.e. 4.5°C) within the
‘likely’ range of 2-4.5°C set out by IPCC (2007a, Chapter
10) to guide decisions, which would mean that achieving a
target of 2°C (above the pre-industrial level), at equilibrium,
is already outside the range of scenarios considered in this
chapter, whilst a target of 3°C (above the pre-industrial level)
would imply stringent mitigation scenarios, with emissions
peaking within 10 years. Using the ‘best estimate’ assumption
of climate sensitivity, the most stringent scenarios (stabilizing
at 445-490 ppmv CO,-equivalent) could limit global mean
temperature increases to 2—2.4°C above the pre-industrial level,
at equilibrium, requiring emissions to peak before 2015 and to
be around 50% of current levels by 2050. Scenarios stabilizing

"Short-term mitigation and adaptation decisions are related
to long-term climate goals (high agreement, much evidence). A
risk management or ‘hedging’ approach can assist policymakers
to advance mitigation decisions in the absence of a long-term
target and in the face of considerable uncertainties relating
to the cost of mitigation, the efficacy of adaptation and the
negative impacts of climate change. The extent and the timing
of the desirable hedging strategy will depend on the stakes, the
odds and societies’ attitudes to risks, for example with respect
to risks of abrupt change in geo-physical systems and other key
vulnerabilities. A variety of integrated assessment approaches
exist to assess mitigation benefits in the context of policy
decisions relating to such long-term climate goals. There will
be ample opportunity for learning and mid-course corrections
as new information becomes available. However, actions in the
short term will largely determine what future climate change
impacts can be avoided. Hence, analysis of short-term decisions
should not be decoupled from analysis that considers long-term
climate change outcomes (high agreement, much evidence).

"Decision-making concerning the appropriate level of
mitigation in a cost-benefit context is an iterative risk-
management process that considers investment in mitigation and
adaptation, co-benefits of undertaking climate change decisions
and the damages due to climate change. It is intertwined with
development decisions and pathways. Cost-benefit analysis tries
to quantify climate change damages in monetary terms as the
social cost of carbon (SCC) or time-discounted damages. Due
to considerable uncertainties and difficulties in quantifying non-
market damages, it is difficult to estimate SCC with confidence.
Results depend on a large number of normative and empirical
assumptions that are not known with any certainty. SCC
estimates in the literature vary by three orders of magnitude.
Often they are likely to be understated and will increase a few
percent per year (i.e. 2.4% for carbon-only and 24% for the
social costs of other greenhouse gases (IPCC, 2007b, Chapter
20). SCC estimates for 2030 range between 8 and 189 US$/
tCO,-equivalent (IPCC, 2007b, Chapter 20), which compares
to carbon prices between | to 24 US$/tCO,-equivalent for
mitigations scenarios stabilizing between 485-570 ppmv CO,-
equivalent) and 31 to 121 US$/tCO,-equivalent for scenarios
stabilizing between 440-485 ppmv CO)-equivalent, respectively

"Scenario definitions in the literature differ depending on the
purpose of the scenarios and how they were developed. The
SRES report (Nakicenovic et a/., 2000) defines a scenario as
a plausible description of how the future might develop, based
on a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions
(‘scenario logic’) about the key relationships and driving forces
(e.g. rate of technology change or prices). Some studies in the
literature apply the term ‘scenario’ to ‘best-guess’ or forecast
types of projections. Such studies do not aim primarily at
exploring alternative futures, but rather at identifying ‘most
likely’ outcomes. Probabilistic studies represent a different
approach, in which the range of outcomes is based on a consistent
estimate of the probability density function (PDF) for crucial
input parameters. In these cases, outcomes are associated with
an explicit estimate of likelihood, albeit one with a substantial
subjective component. Examples include probabilistic
projections for population (Lutz and Sanderson, 2001) and CO,

"Global futures scenarios are deeply rooted in the long
history of narrative scenarios (Carpenter et al., 2005; UNEP,

lie with the future studies of the 1970s (Raskin et al., 2005).
These responded to emerging concerns about the long-term
sufficiency of natural resources to support expanding global
populations and economies. This first wave of global scenarios
included ambitious mathematical simulation models (Meadows
et al., 1972; Mesarovic and Pestel, 1974) as well as speculative
narrative (Kahn et al., 1976). At this time, scenario analysis
was first used at Royal Dutch/Shell as a strategic management
technique (Wack, 1985a, 1985b; Schwartz, 1991).

"Another type of mitigation (intervention or climate policy)
scenario approach specifies future ‘worlds’ that are internally
consistent with some specified climate target (e.g. a global
temperature increase of no more than 1°C by 2100), and then
works backwards to develop feasible emission trajectories
and emission driver combinations leading to these targets.
Such scenarios, also referred to as ‘safe landing’ or ‘tolerable
window’ scenarios, imply the necessary development and
implementation of climate policies intended to achieve these
targets in the most efficient way (Morita et a/., 2001). A number
of such new multi-gas stabilization scenarios are assessed in
this chapter.

"Some scenarios in the literature are difficult to classify
as mitigation (intervention) or baseline (reference or non-
intervention), such as those developed to assess sustainable
development (SD) paths. These studies consider futures that
require radical policy and behavioural changes to achieve a
transition to a postulated sustainable development pathway.
Greenpeace formulated one of the first such scenarios (Lazarus
et al., 1993). Many sustainable development scenarios are also
included in this assessment. Where they do not include explicit
policies, as in the case of SRES scenarios, they can be classified
as baseline or non-intervention scenarios. For example, the
SRES B1 family of reference scenarios can be characterized
as having many elements of a sustainability transition that lead
to generally low GHG emissions, even though the scenarios do
not include policies or measures explicitly directed at emissions
mitigation.

"A second round of integrated global analysis began
in the late 1980s and 1990s, prompted by concerns with
climate change and sustainable development. These included
narratives of alternative futures ranging from ‘optimistic’ and
‘pessimistic’ worlds to consideration of ‘surprising’ futures
(Burrows et al., 1991; the Central Planning Bureau of the
Netherlands, 1992; Kaplan, 1994; Svedin and Aniansson, 1987;
Toth et al., 1989). The long-term nature of the climate change
issue introduced a new dimension and has resulted in a rich
new literature of global emissions scenarios, starting from the
IPCC IS92 scenarios (Pepper et al., 1992; Leggett et al., 1992)
and most recent scenario comparisons projects (e.g. EMF and
IMCP). The first decades of scenario assessment paved the
way by showing the power — and limits — of both deterministic
modelling and descriptive future analyses. A central challenge
of global scenario exercises today is to unify these two aspects
by blending the objectivity and clarity of quantification with the
richness of narrative (Raskin et al., 2005).

"GHG emissions may be adopted for reasons that are not

root cause of this potential confusion is that, in practice, many
policies can both reduce GHG emissions and achieve other
goals (so-called multiple benefits). Whether such policies are
assumed to be adopted for climate or non-climate policy-related
reasons is determined by the scenario developer, based on the
underlying scenario narrative. While this is a problem in terms
of making a clear distinction between intervention and non-
intervention scenarios, it is at the same time an opportunity.
Because many decisions are not made for reasons of climate
change alone, measures implemented for reasons other

"An important consideration in scenario generation is the
nature of the economic development process and whether (and to
what extent) developing countries will follow the development
pathways of industrialized countries with respect to energy use

technology and product design choices made by industrialized
countries in the post-World War II period of low energy prices
are responsible for the major recent increase in world GHG
emissions. A simple mimicking by developing countries of the
development paradigm established by industrialized countries
could lead to a very large increase in global GHG emissions
(see Chapter 2). It may be noted, however, that energy/GDP
elasticities in industrialized countries have first increased in
successive stages of industrialization, with acceleration during
the 1950s and 1960s, but have fallen sharply since then, due
to factors such as relative growth of services in GDP share,
technical progress induced by higher oil prices and energy
conservation efforts.

"The economic convergence literature (Abramovitz, 1986;
Baumol, 1986), using a standard neoclassical economic growth
setup following Solow (1956), found evidence of convergence
only between the richest countries. Other research efforts
documented ‘conditional convergence’ — meaning that countries
appeared to reach their own steady states at a fairly uniform
rate of 2% per year (Barro, 1991; Mankiw ef al., 1992). Jones
(1997) found that the future steady-state distribution of per

Important differences would continue to arise among the bottom
two-thirds of the income distribution, thus confirming past
trends. Total factor productivity (TFP) levels and convergence
for the evolution of income distribution are also important.
Expected catch-up, and even overtaking per-person incomes, as
well as changes in leaders in the world distribution of income,

"These different relationships between development
pathways and GHG emissions may (or may not) be captured
in models used for long-term world scenarios, by changes in
aggregated variables (e.g. per person income) or through more
disaggregated economic parameters, such as the structure of
expenses devoted to a given need (e.g. heating, transport or
food, or the share of energy and transportation in the production
function of industrial sectors). This means that alternative
configurations of these underlying factors can be combined
to give internally consistent socio-economic scenarios with
identical rates of economic growth. It would be false to say
that current economic models ignore these factors. They are
to some extent captured by changes in economic parameters,
such as the structure of household expenses devoted to heating,
transportation or food; the share of each activity in the total
household budget; and the share of energy and transportation
costs in total costs in the industrial sector.

"Convergence is limited for a number of reasons, such
as imperfect mobility of factors (notably labour); different
endowments (notably human capital); market segmentation
(notably services); and limited technology diffusion. Social
inertia (as referred to in Chapter 2, see Section 2.2.3) also
contributes to delay convergence. Therefore only limited catch-
up can be factored in baseline scenarios: while capital quality
is likely to push up productivity growth in most countries,
especially in those lagging behind, labour quality is likely to drag
down productivity growth in a number of countries, unless there
are massive investments in education. However, appropriate
policies may accelerate the adoption of new technologies
and create incentives for human capital formation and thus
accelerate convergence (Martins and Nicoletti, 2005). Nelson
and Fagerberg, arguing within an evolutionary paradigm, have
different perspectives on the convergence issue (Fagerberg,

"The above discussion provides the economic background
for the range of assumptions on the long-term convergence of
income between developing and developed countries (measured
by GDP per person) found in the scenario literature. The annual
rate of income convergence between 11 world regions in the
SRES scenarios falls within the range of less than 0.5% in the
A2 scenario family to less than 2% in Al (both in PPP and
MER metrics). The highest rate of income convergence in the
SRES is similar to the observed convergence, during the period
1950-1990, of 90 regions in Europe (Barro and Sala-i-Martin
1997). However, Griibler et al. (2006) note that extending
convergence analysis to national or sub-national level would
suggest that income disparities are larger than suggested
by simple inter-regional comparisons and that scenarios of
(relative) income convergence are highly sensitive to the spatial
level of aggregation used in the analysis. An important finding
from the sensitivity analysis performed is that less convergence
generally yields higher emissions (Griibler et al., 2004). In
B2, an income ratio (between 11 world regions, in market
exchange rates) of seven corresponds to CO, emissions of
14.2 GtC in 2100, while shifting this income ratio to 16 would
lead to CO emissions of 15.5 GtC in 2100. Results pointing
in the same direction were also obtained for A2. This can be
explained by slower TFP growth, slower capital turnover, and
less ‘technological congruence’, leading to slower adoption
of low-emission technologies in developing countries. On the
other hand, as climate stabilization scenarios require global
application of climate policies and convergence in the adoption
of low-emission technologies, they are less compatible with
low economic convergence scenarios.

negative features, such as segregation, there is no consensus
as to the interventions that are necessary or desirable to alter
social and cultural processes. On the other hand, understanding
their role is crucial for assessing the evolution of the social
infrastructure that underpins technological progress and human
welfare (Jung et a/., 2000) as well as evolving perceptions and
social understanding of climate change risk (see Rayner and

"Most ofthe SRES scenarios still fall within the plausible range
of population outcomes, according to more recent literature
(see Figure 3.1). However, the high end of the SRES population
range now falls above the range of recent projections from
IIASA and the UN. This is a particular problem for population
projections in East Asia, the Middle East, North Africa and the
Former Soviet Union, where the differences are large enough to
strain credibility (Van Vuuren and O’Neill, 2006). In addition,
the population assumptions in SRES and the vast majority of
more recent emissions scenarios do not cover the low end of
the current range of population projections well. New scenario
exercises will need to take the lower population projections
into account. All other factors being equal, lower population
projections are likely to result in lower emissions. However,
a small number of recent studies that have used updated and
lower population projections (Carpenter et al., 2005; Van
Vuuren et al., 2007; Riahi et al., 2006) indicate that changes
in other drivers of emissions might partly offset the impact of
lower population assumptions, thus leading to no significant
changes in emissions.

"Recent projections indicate a small downward revision to
the medium (or ‘best guess’) outlook and to the high end of
the uncertainty range, and a larger downward revision to the
low end of the uncertainty range (Van Vuuren and O’Neill,
2006). This global result is driven primarily by changes in
outlook for the Asia and the Africa-Latin America-Middle East
(ALM) region. On a more detailed level, trends are driven by
changes in the outlook for Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle
East and North Africa region, and the East Asia region, where
recent data show lower than expected fertility rates, as well as
a much more pessimistic view on the extent and duration of
the HIV/AIDS crisis in Sub-Saharan Africa. In contrast, in the
OECD region, updated projections are somewhat higher than
previous estimates. This comes from changes in assumptions
regarding migration (in the case of the UN projections), or to
a more optimistic projection of future life expectancy (in the
case of International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis
(IIASA) projections). In the Eastern Europe and Central Asia
(Reforming Economic, REF) region, projections have been
revised downward, especially by the UN, driven mainly by
recent data showing very low fertility levels and mortality rates
that are quite high relative to other industrialized countries.

reported as gross domestic product (GDP), often measured in

corrected by reporting activities as constant prices taken from a

"The uses of MER-based economic projections in SRES have
recently been criticized (Castles and Henderson, 2003a, 2003b;
Henderson, 2005). The vast majority of scenarios published
in the literature use MER-based economic projections. Some
exceptions exist, for example, MESSAGE in SRES, and more
recent scenarios using the MERGE model (Manne and Richels,
2003), along with shorter term scenarios to 2030, including
the G-Cubed model (McKibbin ef al., 2004a, 2004b), the
International Energy Outlook (USDOE, 2004), the IEA World
Energy Outlook (IEA, 2004) and the POLES model used by
the European Commission (2003). The main criticism of the
MER-based models is that GDP data for world regions are not
corrected with respect to purchasing power parities (PPP) in
most of the model runs. The implied consequence is that the
economic activity levels in non-OECD countries generally
appear to be lower than they actually are when measured in PPP
units. In addition, the high growth SRES scenarios (Al and B1
families) assume that regions tend to conditionally converge in
terms of relative per-person income across regions (see Section
3.1.4). According to the critics, the use of MER, together with
the assumption of conditional convergence, lead to overstated
economic growth in the poorer regions and excessive growth in
energy demand and emission levels.

See, for example, UN (1993), (para 1.38): ‘When the objective is to compare the volumes of goods or services produced or consumed per head, data in national currencies must
be converted into a common currency by means of purchasing power parities and not exchange rates. It is well known that, in general, neither market nor fixed exchange rates
reflect the relative internal purchasing powers of different currencies. When exchange rates are used to convert GDP, or other statistics, into a common currency the prices at
which goods and services in high-income countries are valued tend to be higher than in low-income countries, thus exaggerating the differences in real incomes between them.
Exchange rate converted data must not, therefore, be interpreted as measures of the relative volumes of goods and services concerned.’

"A team of SRES researchers responded to this criticism,
indicating that the use of MER or PPP data does not in itself
lead to different emission projections outside the range of the
literature. In addition, they stated that the use of PPP data in
most scenarios models was (and still is) infeasible, due to lack
of required data in PPP terms, for example price elasticities and
social accounting matrices (Nakicenovic et al., 2003; Griibler
et al., 2004). A growing number of other researchers have also
indicated different opinions on this issue or explored it in a more
quantitative sense (e.g. Dixon and Rimmer, 2005; Nordhaus,
2006b; Manne and Richels, 2003; McKibbin ef al., 2004a,

"There are at least three strands to this debate. The first is
whether economic projections based on MER are appropriate,
and thus whether the economic growth rates reported in the
SRES and other MER-based scenarios are reasonable and
robust. The second is whether the choice of the exchange rate
matters when it comes to emission scenarios. The third is
whether it is possible, or practical, to develop robust scenarios
given the sparseness of relevant and required PPP data. While
the GDP data are available in PPP, other economic scenario
characteristics, such as capital and operational cost of energy
facilities, are usually available either in domestic currencies
or MER. Full model calibration in PPP for regional and global
models is still difficult due to the lack of underlying data. This
could be one of the reasons why a vast majority of long-term
emissions scenarios continues to be calibrated in MER.
"	Text
"For principle and practical reasons, INordhaus (2UU5)
recommends that economic growth scenarios should be
constructed by using regional or national accounting figures
(including growth rates) for each region, but using PPP
exchange rates for aggregating regions and updating over time
by use of a superlative price index. In contrast, Timmer (2005)
actually prefers the use of MER data in long-term modelling,
as such data are more readily available, and many international
relations within the model are based on MER. Others (e.g. Van
Vuuren and Alfsen, 2006) also argue that the use of MER data
in long-term modelling is often preferable, given that model
parameters are usually estimated on MER data and international
trade within the models is based on MER. The real economic
consequences of the choice of conversion rates will obviously
depend on how the scenarios are constructed, as well as on the
type of model used for quantifying the scenarios. In some of
the short-term scenarios (with a horizon to 2030) a bottom-up
approach is taken where assumptions about productivity growth
and investment/saving decisions are the main drivers of growth
in the models (e.g. McKibbin et al., 2004a, 2004b). In long-
term scenario models, a top-down approach is more commonly
used where the actual growth rates are prescribed more directly,
based on convergence or other assumptions about long-term
growth potentials.

emissions (or other physical measures such as energy), the Kaya

based representations of GDP will not matter, since emission
intensity will change (in a compensating manner) when the GDP

lower economic growth rates for developing countries under
the convergence assumption, it is also necessary to adjust the
relationship between income and demand for energy with lower
economic growth, leading to slower improvements in energy

choice of metric should not appreciably affect the final emission

McKibbin et al. (2004a, 2004b) find some differences in
emission levels between using PPP-based and MER-based
estimates. Analysis of their work indicates that these results
critically depend on, among other things, the combination of
convergence assumptions and the mathematical approximation
used between MER-GDP and PPP-GDP. In the Manne and
Richels work for instance, autonomous efficiency improvement
(AEI) is determined as a percentage of economic growth and
estimated on the basis of MER data. In going from MER to
PPP, the economic growth rate declines as expected, leading to
a decline in the autonomous efficiency improvement. However,
it is not clear whether it is realistic not to change the AEI
rate when changing conversion measure. On the other hand,
Holtsmark and Alfsen (2004a, 2004b), showed that in their
simple model consistent replacement of the metric (PPP for
MER) — for income levels as well as for underlying technology
relationships — leads to a full cancellation of the impact of
choice of metric on projected emission levels.

as represented by changes in energy intensity, expressed as
gigajoule (GJ)/GDP, and change in the carbon intensity of the

energy intensity improves significantly across the century — with
a mean annual intensity improvement of 1%. The 90% range
of the annual average intensity improvement is between 0.5%

the importance of the uncertainty associated with this ratio. The

atmosphere system (e.g. Strengers et al., 2004), must be
considered in order to achieve realistic estimates of the future
development of the carbon cycle; thereby providing further
motivation for ongoing development to explicitly model land
and land-use drivers in global integrated assessment and climate
economic frameworks. For example, in a model comparison
study of six climate models of intermediate complexity, Brovkin
et al. (2006) concluded that land-use changes contributed to a
decrease in global mean annual temperature in the range of
0.13-0.25°C, mainly during the 19th century and the first half
of the 20"" century, which is in line with conclusions from other
studies, such as Matthews et al. (2003).

the potential limitations or saturation points of plant responses.
However, to date, long-term scenarios from integrated

feedbacks on terrestrial ecosystems, much less fully account for
the many effects. Current integrated assessment representations

changes in climate. For instance, rising temperatures and CO,
fertilization may improve regional crop yields in the short term,
thereby reducing pressure for additional cropland and resulting
in increased afforestation. However, modelling the beneficial
impacts of CO, fertilization is not as straightforward as once

increases in tropospheric ozone and smog associated with
higher temperatures that will depress plant growth and partially
offset CO, fertilization; expected increases in the variability

"Technological change is also a critical driver of land use,
and a critical assumption in land-use projections. For example,
Sands and Leimbach (2003) suggest that, globally, 800 million
hectares of cropland expansion could be avoided with a 1%
annual growth in crop yields. Similarly, Kurosawa (2006)
estimates decreased cropland requirements of 18% by 2050,
relative to 2000, with 2% annual growth in global average crop
yields. Alternatively, the MEA scenarios implement a more
complex representation of yield growth projections that, in
addition to autonomous technological change, reflect the changes
in production practices, investments, technology transfer,
environmental degradation, and climate change. The net effect
is positive, but shows declining productivity growth over time
for some commodities, due in large part to diminishing marginal
technical productivity gains and environmental degradation. In
all these studies, increasing (decreasing) net productivity per
hectare results in reduced (increased) cropland demand.

"Most post-SRES global scenarios project significant
changes in agricultural land caused primarily by regional
changes in food demand and production technology. Scenarios
with larger amounts of land used for agriculture result from
assumptions about higher population growth rates, higher
food demands, and lower rates of technological improvement
that generate negligible increases in crop yields. Combined,
these effects are projected to lead to a sizeable expansion (up
to 40%) of agricultural land between 1995 and 2100 (Figure
3.7). Conversely, lower population growth and food demand,
and more rapid technological change, are projected to result
in lower demand for agricultural land (as much as 20% less
global agricultural acreage by the end of the century). In the
short-term, almost all scenarios suggest an increase in cropland
acreage and decline in forest land to meet projected increases
in food, feed, and livestock grazing demands over the next
few decades. Cropland changes range from -18% to +69% by
2050 relative to 2000 (from -123 to +1158 million hectares)

and economic growth are the most significant food demand
drivers through per person consumption. Total world food
consumption is expected to increase by over 50% by 2030
(Bruinsma, 2003). Moreover, economic growth is expected to
generate significant structural change in consumption patterns,
with diets shifting to include more livestock products and fewer
staples such as roots and tubers. As a result, per person meat
consumption is expected to show a strong global increase, in
the order of 25% by 2030, with faster growth in developing and
transitional countries of more than 40% and 30%, respectively
(Bruinsma, 2003; Cassman et al., 2003). The Millennium
Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) scenarios projected that global
average meat consumption would increase from 36 kg/person in
1997 to 41—70 kg/person by 2050, with corresponding increases
in overall food and livestock feed demands (Carpenter et al.,
2005). Additional cropland is expected to be required to support
these projected increases in demand. Beyond 2050, food demand
is expected to level off with slow-down of population growth.

land-use projections. The most comprehensive studies, in terms
of sector and land-type coverage, are the SRES (Nakicenovic et

(Strengers et al., 2004), the scenarios from the Global Scenarios
Group (Raskin et al., 2002), UNEP’s Global Environment

contributed global land-use projections for climate analysis,
especially for forestry (Sands and Leimbach, 2003; Sohngen
and Mendelsohn, 2003, 2007; Sathaye et al., 2006; Sohngen
and Sedjo, 2006). In general, the post-SRES scenarios, though
scarce in number for agricultural land use, have projected
increasing global cropland areas, smaller forest-land areas,
and mixed results for changes in global grassland (Figure 3.7).
Unlike the SRES land-use scenarios that span a broader range
while representing diverse storylines, the post-SRES scenarios,
for forestry in particular, illustrate greater convergence across
models on projected land-use change.

an increase in emissions across most of the century, resulting

"Several reasons may contribute to the fact that emissions
have not declined in spite of somewhat lower projections for
population and GDP. An important reason is that the lower
demographic projections are only recently being integrated
into emission scenario literature. Second, indirect impacts
in the models are likely to offset part of the direct impacts.
For instance, lower energy demand leads to lower fossil fuel
depletion, thus allowing for a higher share of fossil fuels in the
total energy mix over a longer period of time. Finally, in recent
years there has been increasing attention to the interpretation of
fossil fuel reserves reported in the literature. Some models may
have decreased oil and gas use in this context, leading to higher
coal use (and thus higher emissions).

used more simplified land-use modules. ASF and MESSAGE
also simulated land-use emissions, however ASF did not
have a specific land-use module and MESSAGE incorporated

"The emissions scenario chapter in the TAR (Morita et al.,

that time, certainly regarding mitigation, most of the scenarios
literature was still primarily focused on CO, emissions from

including the SRES baseline scenarios, but also some other
modelling efforts (Manne and Richels, 2001; Babiker et al.,

Sulphur emissions are relevant for climate change modelling
as they contribute to the formation of aerosols, which affect
precipitation patterns and, taken together, reduce radiative
forcing. Sulphur emissions also contribute to regional and local
air pollution. Global sulphur dioxide emissions have grown
approximately in parallel with the increase in fossil fuel use
(Smith et al., 2001, 2004; Stern, 2005). However, since around
the late 1970s, the growth in emissions has slowed considerably
(Griibler, 2002). Implementation of emissions controls, a shift
to lower sulphur fuels in most industrialized countries, and the
economic transition process in Eastern Europe and the Former
Soviet Union have contributed to the lowering of global sulphur
emissions (Smith et a/., 2001). Conversely, with accelerated
economic development, the growth of sulphur emissions in
many parts of Asia has been high in recent decades, although
growth rates have moderated recently (Streets et al., 2000;

abatement (as a consequence of increasing affluence). Together,
these factors may result in an inverted U-shaped pattern of SO,
emissions, where emissions increase during early stages of
industrialization, peak and then fall at higher levels of income,
following a Kuznets curve (World Bank, 1992). This general
trend is also apparent in most of the recent emissions scenarios

"Over time, new scenarios have generally produced lower
SO, emissions projections. A comprehensive comparison of
the SRES and more recent sulphur-emission scenarios is given
in Van Vuuren and O’Neill (2006). Figure 3.12 illustrates that
the resulting spread of sulphur emissions over the medium
term (up to the year 2050) is predominantly due to the varying
assumptions about the timing of future emissions control,
particularly in developing countries’. Scenarios at the lower
boundary assume the rapid introduction of sulphur-control
technologies on a global scale, and hence, a reversal of historical
trends and declining emissions in the initial years of the scenario.
Conversely, the upper boundaries of emissions are characterized
by a rapid increase over coming decades, primarily driven by
the increasing use of coal and oil at relatively low levels of
sulphur control (SRES Al and A2).

"The comparison shows that overall the SRES scenarios are
fairly consistent with recent projections concerning the long-
term uncertainty range (Smith et al., 2004; see Figure 3.12).
However, the emissions peak over the short-term of some
high emissions scenarios in SRES, which lie above the upper
boundary estimates of the recent scenarios. There are two main
reasons for this difference. First, recent sulphur inventories for
the year 2000 have shifted downward. Second, and perhaps
more importantly, new information on present and planned
sulphur legislation in some developing countries, such as India
(Carmichael et al., 2002) and China (Streets et al., 2001) has
become available. Anticipating this change in legislation,
recent scenarios project sulphur emissions to peak earlier and at
lower levels compared to the SRES. Also the lower boundary
projections of the recent literature have shifted downward
slightly compared to the SRES scenario.

The most important sources of NO, emissions are fossil fuel
combustion and industrial processes, which combined with
other sources such as natural and anthropogenic soil release,
biomass burning, lightning, and atmospheric processes, amount
to around 25 MtN per year. Considerable uncertainties exist,
particularly around the natural sources (Prather et al., 1995;
Olivier et al., 1998; Olivier and Berdowski, 2001; Cofala et
al. (2006). Fossil fuel combustion in the electric power and
transport sectors is the largest source of NO,, with emissions
largely being related to the combustion practice. In recent years,
emissions from fossil fuel use in North America and Europe are
either constant or declining. Emissions have been increasing
in most parts of Asia and other developing parts of the world,
mainly due to the growing transport sector (Cofala et al., 2006;
Smith, 2005; WBCSD, 2004). However in the longer term,
most studies project that NO, emissions in developing countries
will saturate and eventually decline, following the trend in the
developed world. However, the pace of this trend is uncertain.
Emissions are projected to peak in the developing world as
early as 2015 (WBCSD, 2004, focusing on the transport sector)
and, in worst cases, around the end of this century (see the high
emissions projection of Smith, 2005).

"In the past, BC and OC emissions have been poorly
represented in economic and systems engineering models due
to unavailability of data. For example, in the IPCC’s Third
Assessment Report, BC and OC estimates were developed by
using CO emissions (IPCC, 2001b). One of the main reasons
for this has been the lack of adequate global inventories for
different emission sources. However, some detailed global and
regional emission inventories of BC and OC have recently
become available (Table 3.3). In addition, some detailed
regional inventories are also available including Streets et al.
(2003) and Kupiainen and Klimont (2004). While many of
these are comprehensive with regard to detail, considerable
uncertainty still exists in the inventories, mainly due to the
variety in combustion techniques for different fuels as well
as measurement techniques. In order to represent these
uncertainties, some studies, such as Bond et al. (2004), provide
high, low and ‘best-guess’ values.

factor that Rao et al. (2005) also account for is current and

"Both Streets et al. (2004) and Rao et al. (2005) show a
general decline in BC and OC emissions in developed countries,
as well as in regions such as East Asia (including China). In
other developing regions, such as Africa and South Asia, slower
technology penetration rates lead to much lower emission
reductions. There is a large decline in emissions from the
residential sector in the developing countries, due to the gradual
replacement of traditional fuels and technologies with more
efficient ones. Transport-related emissions in both industrialized
and developing countries decline in the long-term due to stringent
regulations, technology improvements and fuel switching.
"	Text
"Mitigation scenarios explore the feasibility and costs of
achieving specified climate change or emissions targets, often in
comparison to a corresponding baseline scenario. The specified
target itself is an important modelling and policy issue. Because
Article 2 of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) states as its objective the ‘stabilization
of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level
that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference
with the climate system’, most long-term mitigation studies
have focused their efforts on GHG concentration stabilization
scenarios. However, several other climate change targets may
be chosen, for example the rate of temperature change, radiative
forcing, or climate change impacts (see e.g. Richels ef al.,
2004; Van Vuuren ef al., 2006b; Corfee-Morlot et al., 2005).
In general, selecting a climate policy target early in the cause-
effect chain of human activities to climate change impacts, such
as emissions stabilization, increases the certainty of achieving
required reduction measures, while increasing the uncertainty
on climate change impacts (see Table 3.4). Selecting a climate
target further down the cause-effect chain (e.g. temperature
change, or even avoided climate impacts) provides for greater
specification of a desired climate target, but decreases certainty
of the emission reductions required to reach that target.

different greenhouse gases with different atmospheric lifetimes

comprehensive overview of the different methods that have been

different probability density functions of climate sensitivity in
the MAGICC simple climate model to estimate relationships
between the probability of achieving climate targets and required
emission reductions. Studies by Richels et al. (2004), Yohe et
al. (2004), Den Elzen et al. (2006), Keppo et al. (2006), and
Kypreos (2006) have used a similar probabilistic concept in an

"temperature is not radiative forcing stabilization, but rather
to allow radiative forcing to peak at a certain concentration,
and then decrease with additional emissions reductions so as
to avoid (delayed) further warming and stabilize global mean
temperature (see Meinshausen, 2006; Kheshgi et a/., 2005; Den
Elzen et al., 2006). Finally, targets can also be defined to limit
a rate of change, such as the rate of temperature change. While
such targets have the advantage of providing a link to impacts
related to the rate of climate change, strategies to achieve them
may be more sensitive to uncertainties and thus, require careful
planning. The rate of temperature change targets, for instance,
may be difficult to achieve in the short-term even, using multi-

"While GWPs do not necessarily lead to the most cost-effective
stabilization solution (given a long-term target), they can still
be a practical choice: in real-life policies an exchange metric
is needed to facilitate emissions trading between gases within
a specified time period. Allowing such exchanges creates the
opportunity for cost savings through ‘what and where flexibility’.
It is appropriate to ask what are the costs of using GWPs
versus not using them and whether other ‘real world’ metrics
exist that could perform better. O’Neill (2003) and Johansson
et al. (2006) have argued that the disadvantages of GWPs are
likely to be outweighed by the advantages, by showing that the
cost difference between a multi-gas strategy and a CO-only
strategy is much larger than the difference between a GWP-
based multi-gas strategy and a cost-optimal strategy. Aaheim
et al. (2006) found that the cost of using GWPs compared to
optimal weights, depends on the ambition of climate policies.
Postponing the early CH, reductions of the GWP-based strategy,
as is suggested by inter-temporal optimization, generally leads
to larger temperature increases during the 2000-2020 period.
This is because the increased reduction of CO, from the energy
sector also leads to reduction of sulphur emissions (hence the
cooling associated with sulphur-based aerosols) but allows the
potential to be used later in the century.

"Useful overviews of the mitigation and economic implication
of substitution metrics are provided by Bradford (2001) and
Godal (2003). Models that use inter-temporal optimization
can avoid the use of substitution metrics (such as GWPs) by
optimizing the reductions of all gases simultaneously under a
chosen climate target. Inter-temporal optimization or perfect
foresight models assume that economic agents know future
prices and make decisions to minimize costs. Manne and
Richels (2001) show, using their model, that using GWPs as
the basis of substitution did not lead to the cost-optimal path
(minimizing welfare losses) for the long-term targets analyzed.
In particular, reducing methane early had no benefit for reaching
the long-term target, given its short lifespan in the atmosphere.
In the recent EMF-21 study some models validated this result
(see De la Chesnaye and Weyant, 2006). Figure 3.15 shows the
projected EMF-21 CO), CHy, NO, and F-gas reductions across
models stabilizing radiative forcing at 4.5 W/m2. Most of the
EMF-21 models based substitution between gases on GWPs.
However, three models substituted gases on the basis of inter-
temporal optimization. While (for most of the gases) there are
no systematic differences between the results from the two
groups, for methane and some F-gases (not shown), there are
clear differences related to the very different lifespans of these
gases. The models that do not use GWPs, do not substantially
reduce CH, until the end of the time horizon. However, for
models using GWPs, the reduction of CH, emissions in the
first three decades is substantial: here, CH, reductions become
a cost-effective short-term abatement strategy, despite the short
lifespan (Van Vuuren et al., 2006b). It should be noted that if

Parts of the modelling community have expanded their

previous section, multi-gas mitigation scenarios use different
targets, thus making comparison more complicated.

Some recent studies have developed scenarios that do not
stabilize radiative forcing (or temperature) — but show a
peak before the end of the modelling time horizon (in most
cases 2100).

At the time of the TAR, many studies used the SRES

"literature on emission pathways since the TAR has concerned
a temporary overshoot of the target (concentration, forcing, or
temperature). Meinshausen (2006) used a simple carbon-cycle
model to illustrate that for low-concentration targets (i.e. below
3 W/m?/ 450 ppmv CO,-eq) overshoot is inevitable, given the
feasible maximum rate of reduction. Wigley (2003) argued
that overshoot profiles may give important economic benefits.
In response, O’Neill and Oppenheimer (2004) showed that
the associated incremental warming of large overshoots may
significantly increase the risks of exceeding critical climate
thresholds to which ecosystems are known to be able to adapt.
Other emission pathways that lead to less extreme concentration
overshoots may provide a sensible compromise between these
two results. For instance, the ‘peaking strategies’ chosen by
Den Elzen et al. (2006) show that it is possible to increase the
likelihood of meeting the long-term temperature target or to
reach targets with a similar likelihood at lower costs. Similar
arguments for analyzing overshoot strategies are made by
Harvey (2004), and Kheshgi et al. (2005).

"relationship exists between the two indicators. This can be
explained by the fact that CO, forms by far the most important
contributor to radiative forcing — and subsequently, a reduction
in radiative forcing needs to coincide with a reduction in CO,
concentration. The existing spread across the studies is caused
by several factors, including differences in the abatement rate
among alternative gases, differences in specific forcing values
for GHGs and other radiative gases (particularly aerosols),
and differences in the atmospheric chemistry and carbon cycle
models that are used. Here, the relationship is used to classify
the available mitigation literature into six categories that vary
in the stringency of the climate targets. The most stringent
group includes those scenarios that aim to stabilize radiative
forcing below 3 W/m2. This group also includes all CO,-only
scenarios that stabilize CO, concentrations below 400 ppmv. In
contrast, the least stringent group of mitigation scenarios have a
radiative forcing in 2100 above 6 W/m? — associated with CO,
concentrations above 660 ppmv. By far the most studied group
of scenarios are those that aim to stabilize radiative forcing at
4-5 W/m? or 485-570 ppmv CO, (see Table 3.5).

Note that the classification needs to be used with care. Each category includes a range of studies going from the upper to the lower boundary. The classification of

lization metrics, is subject to uncertainty (see Figure 3.16).

"The emission range for the scenarios with low and
intermediate targets between 3.5 and 5 W/m? (scenarios in
categories II] and IV) are consistent with the range of the
450 and 550 ppmv CO, scenarios in the TAR. Emissions in
this category tend to show peak emissions around 2040 — with
emissions in 2100 similar to, or slightly below, emissions today.
Although for these categories less rapid and forceful reductions
are required than for the more stringent targets, studies focusing
on these stabilization categories find that a wide portfolio of
reduction measures would be needed to achieve such emission
pathways in a cost-effective way.

"The timing of emission reductions also depends on the
stringency of the stabilization target. Timing of climate policy
has always been an important topic in the scenario literature.
While some studies argue for early action for smooth transitions
and stimulating technology development (e.g. Azar and
Dowlatabadi, 1999, Van Vuuren and De Vries, 2001), others
emphasize delayed response to benefit from better technology
and higher CO, fertilization rates from natural systems at
later points in time (e.g. Wigley et al., 1996; Tol, 2000; for
a more elaborate discussion on timing see also Section 3.6).

with a range of interim targets. Nevertheless, stringent targets

"An increasing body of literature assesses the attainability
of very low targets of below 450 ppmv CO, (e.g. Van Vuuren
et al., 2007; Riahi et al., 2006). These scenarios from class I
and II extend the lower boundary beyond the range of the TAR
stabilization scenarios of 450 ppmv CO, (see upper panels of
Figure 3.17). The attainability of such low targets is shown to
depend on: 1) using a wide range of different reduction options;
and 2) the technology ‘readiness’ of advanced technologies, in
particular the combination of bio-energy, carbon capture and
geologic storage (BECCS). If biomass is grown sustainably,
this combination may lead to negative emissions (Williams,
1998; Herzog et al., 2005), Rao and Riahi (2006), Azar et al.
(2006) and Van Vuuren et al. (2007) all find that such negative
emissions technologies might be essential for achieving very
stringent targets.

"There is a relatively strong relationship between the
cumulative CO, emissions in the 2000-2100 period and the
stringency of climate targets (see Figure 3.18). The uncertainties
associated with individual stabilization levels (shown by the
different percentiles?) are primarily due to the ranges associated
with individual stabilization categories, substitutability of CO,
and non-CO,-emissions, different model parameterizations of
the carbon cycle, but they are also partly due to differences
in emissions pathways (delayed reduction pathways can
allow for somewhat higher cumulative emissions). In general,
scenarios aiming for targets below 3 W/m? require cumulative
CO, emissions of around 1100 GtCO, (range of 800-1500
GtCO,). The cumulative emissions increase for subsequently
less stringent targets. The middle category (4—5 W/m?) requires
emissions to be in the order of 3000 GtCO, (range of 2270-3920
GtCO,). The highest category (>6 W/m?) exhibits emissions,
on average, around 5020 GtCO, (range of 4400-6600 GtCO,).

The figure also indicates that the uncertainty range is relatively
small for the more stringent targets, illustrating the reduced
flexibility of the emissions path and the requirement for early
mitigation. The less stringent categories allow more flexibility in
timing. Most of the stringent stabilization scenarios of category
I (and some II scenarios) assume a temporal overshoot of the
stabilization target (GHG concentration, radiative forcing, or
temperature change) before the eventual date of stabilization
between 2100 and 2150. Recent studies indicate that while such
‘overshoot’ strategies might be inevitable for very low targets
(given the climate system and socio-economic inertia), they
might also provide important economic benefits. At the same
time, however, studies note that the associated rate of warming
from large overshoots might significantly increase the risk of
exceeding critical climate thresholds. (For further discussion,

that (independent of the baseline or target uncertainty) more
than 65% of total emissions reduction would occur in this

over those achieved by carbon-intensity improvements (Figure
3.21). Similar to Morita et al. (2001), it was discovered that
the mitigation response to reduce CO, emissions would
shift over time, from initially focusing on energy efficiency
reductions in the beginning of the 21st century to more carbon-
intensity reduction in the latter half of the century (Figure
3.21). The amount of reductions coming from carbon-intensity
improvement is more important for the most stringent scenarios.
The main reason is that, in the second half of the century,
increasing costs of further energy efficiency improvements and
decreasing costs of low-carbon or carbon-free energy sources
make the latter category relatively more attractive. This trend is

carbon capture and storage, renewables, nuclear and non-CO,

vary strongly depending on whether they are already used in

"As noted above, assumptions with regards to the baseline can
have significant implications for the contribution of individual
mitigation options in achieving stabilization. Figure 3.24 clearly
shows that the baseline assumptions of the four models differ,
and that these differences play a role in explaining some of the
results. For instance, the MESSAGE model already includes a
large amount of renewables in its baseline and further expansion
is relatively costly. Nevertheless, some common trends among
the models may also be observed. First of all, almost all cases
show a clear reduction in primary energy use. Second, in all
models coal use is significantly reduced under the climate policy
scenarios, compared to the baseline. It should be noted that in
those models that consider CCS, the remaining fossil fuel use is
mostly in combination with carbon capture and storage. In 2030,
oil use is only modestly reduced by climate policies — this also
applies to natural gas use. In 2100, both oil and gas are reduced
compared to the baseline in most models. Finally, renewable
energy and nuclear power increase in all models — although the
distribution across these two options differs.

These assumptions generally result in equal carbon prices
across all regions and countries equivalent to global, least-cost
estimates. Relaxation of these modelling assumptions, alone
or in combination (e.g. mitigation-only in Annex I countries,
no emissions trading, or CO,-only mitigation), will lead to an
appreciable increase in all cost categories.

"around 2—3% of the NPV of global GDP over the same period.
Again, on the basis of comparison across models, it is clear
that costs depend both on the stabilization level and baseline
emissions. In general, the spread of costs for each stabilization
category seems to be of a similar order to the differences across
stabilization scenarios from different baselines. In 2030, the
interval covering 80% of the NPV estimates runs from around
0-0.3 trillion for category IV scenarios. The majority of the
more stringent (category III) scenarios range between 0.2 to
about 1.6 trillion US$. In 2050, typical numbers for category
IV are around 0.1-1.2 trillion US$ and, for category III, this
is 1-5 trillion US$ (or below about 1% of the NPV of GDP).
By 2100 the NPV estimates increase further, with the range up
to 5 trillion for category IV scenarios and up to 11 trillion for
category III scenarios, respectively. The results of these studies,
published since the TAR, are consistent with the numbers
presented in the TAR, although the new studies extend results
to substantially lower stabilization levels.
"	Text
"Finally, a similar trend is found for carbon price estimates.
In 2030, typical carbon prices across the range of models and
baselines for a 4.5 W/m? stabilization target (category IV) range
from around 1-24 US$/tCO, (80% of estimates), with the median
of about 11 US$/tCO). For category III, the corresponding prices
are somewhat higher and range from 18-79 US$/tCO, (with the
median of the scenarios around 45 US$/tCO,). Most individual
studies for the most stringent category cluster around prices of
about 100 US$/tCO,.!4 Carbon prices by 2050 are comparatively
higher than those in 2030. For example, costs of category IV
scenarios by 2050 range between 5 and 65 US$/tCO,, and those
for category III range between 30 and 155 US$/tCO,. Carbon
prices in 2100 vary over a much wider range — mostly reflecting
uncertainty in baseline emissions and technology development.
For the medium target of 4.5 W/m2, typical carbon prices in
2100 range from 25-200 US$/tCO, (80% of estimates). This
is primarily a consequence of the nature of this metric, which
often represents costs at the margin. Costs tend to slowly
increase for more stringent targets — with a range between the
10‘ and 90"" percentile of more than 35 to about 350 US$/tCO,
for category III.
"	Text
"GDP losses by 2050 (middle panel of Figure 3.25a) are
comparatively higher than the estimates for 2030. For example,
for category IV scenarios the range is between -1% and 2% GDP
loss compared to baseline (median 0.5%), and for category III
scenarios the range is from slightly negative to 4% (median 1.3%).
The Stern review (2006), looking at the costs of stabilization
in 2050 for a comparable category (500-550 CO,-eq) found a
similar range of between -2% and +5%. For the studies that also
explore different baselines (in addition to multiple stabilization
levels), Figure 3.25a also shows that high emission baselines
(e.g. high SRES-Al or A2 baselines) tend to lead to higher
costs. However, the uncertainty range across the models is at
least of a similar magnitude. Generally, models that combine
assumptions of very slow or incremental technological change
with high baseline emissions (e.g. IGSM-CCSP) tend to show the
relatively highest costs (Figure 3.25a). GDP losses of the lowest
stabilization categories (I & II) are generally below 5.5% by
2050, however the number of studies are relatively limited and in
these scenarios stabilization is achieved predominantly from low
baselines. The absolute GDP losses numbers for 2050 reported
above correspond on average to a reduction of the annual GDP
growth rate of less than 0.05 percentage points for the scenarios
of category IV, and less than 0.1 and 0.12 percentage points for

Report on Land use, Land-use Change, and Forestry (IPCC, 2000)
or the TAR. This section assesses the modelling of land in long-
term climate stabilization and the relationship to detailed global
forestry mitigation estimates from partial equilibrium sectoral
models that model 100-year carbon price trajectories.

"A number of parallel numerical experiments have been
carried out by the Energy Modelling Forum (EMF-21; De la
Chesnaye and Weyant, 2006). The overall conclusion is that
economic benefits of multi-gas strategies are robust across all
models. This is even true, despite the fact that different methods
were used in the study to compare the relative contribution of
these gases in climate forcing (see Section 3.3.3). The EMF-21
study specifically focused on comparing stabilization scenarios
aiming for 4.5 W/m? compared to pre-industrial levels. There
were two cases employed to achieve the mitigation target:

employed in a multi-gas mitigation policy, there is a significant
potential for reduced costs, for a given climate policy objective,
versus the same policy when CO, is the only GHG directly
mitigated. These cost savings can be especially important where
carbon dioxide is not the dominant gas, on a percentage basis,
for a particular economic sector and even for a particular region.
While the previous sections have focused on the joint assessment
of CO, and multi-gas mitigation scenarios, this section explores
the specific role of non-CO, emitting sectors.!5

"Changes in land-use practices are regarded as an important
component of long-term strategies to mitigate climate change.
Modifications to land-use activities can reduce emissions of both
CO), and non-CO, gases (CH, and N,O), increase sequestration
of atmospheric CO, into plant biomass and soils, and produce
biomass fuel substitutes for fossil fuels (see Chapters 4, 8, and 9
of this report for discussions of detailed land-related mitigation
alternatives). Available information before the TAR suggested
that land has the technical potential to sequester up to an additional
319 billion tonnes of CO, (GtCO,) by 2050 in global forests
alone (IPCC, 1996a; IPCC, 2000; IPCC, 2001a). In addition,
current technologies are capable of substantially reducing CH,
and N,O emissions from agriculture (see Chapter 8). A number
of global biomass energy potential assessments have also been
conducted (see Berndes et al. 2003 for an overview).!¢

"Although the contributions of different gases change sharply
over time, there is a considerable spread among the different
models. Many models project relatively early reductions of both
CH, and the fluorinated gases under the multi-gas case. However,
the subset of models that does not use GWPs as the substitution
metric for the relative contributions of the different gases to
the overall target, but does assume inter-temporal optimization
in minimizing abatement costs, do not start to reduce CH,
emissions substantially until the end of the period. The increased
flexibility of a multi-gas mitigation strategy is seen to have
significant implications for the costs of stabilization across all
models participating in the EMF-21. These scenarios concur that
multi-gas mitigation is significantly cheaper than CO,-only. The
potential reductions of the GHG price ranges in the majority of
the studies between 30% and 85% (See Figure 3.27).
"	Text
"In the multi-gas mitigation scenario, all models found that
an appreciable percentage of the emission reductions occur
through reductions of non-CO, gases, which then results in
smaller required reductions of CO,. The emission reduction for
CO, in 2100 therefore drops (on average) from 75% to 67%.
This percentage is still rather high, caused by the large share
of CO, in total emissions (on average, 60% in 2100) and partly
due to the exhaustion of reduction options for non-CO, gases.
The reductions of CH, across the different models averages
around 50%, with remaining emissions coming from sources
for which no reduction options were identified, such as CH,
emissions from enteric fermentation. For N,O, the increased
reduction in the multi-gas strategy is not as large as for CH,
(almost 40%). The main reason is that the identified potential
for emission reductions for the main sources of NO emissions,
fertilizer use and animal manure, is still limited. Finally, for the
fluorinated gases, high reduction rates (about 75%) are found
across the different models.

greater flexibility and was cost-effective for stabilizing
radiative forcing at 4.5 W/m? (Kurosawa, 2006; Van Vuuren
et al., 2006a; Rao and Riahi, 2006; Jakeman and Fisher, 2006).
Jakeman and Fisher (2006), for example, found that including
land-use change and forestry mitigation options reduced the
emissions reduction burden on all other emissions sources
such that the projected decline in global real GDP associated
with achieving stabilization was reduced to 2.3% at 2050 (3.4
trillion US$), versus losses of around 7.1% (10.6 trillion US$)
and 3.3% (4.9 trillion US$) for the CO,-only and multi-gas
scenarios, respectively.!7 Unfortunately, none of the EMF-21
papers isolated the GDP effects associated with biomass fuel
substitution or agricultural non-CO, abatement. However,
given agriculture’s small estimated share of total abatement
(discussed below), the GDP savings associated with agricultural
non-CO, abatement could be expected to be modest overall,
though potentially strategically significant to the dynamics of
mitigation portfolios. Biomass, on the other hand, may have a
substantial abatement role and therefore a large effect on the
economic cost of stabilization. Notably, strategies for increasing
cropland soil carbon have not been incorporated to date into this
class of models (see Chapter 8 for an estimate of the short-term
potential for enhancing agricultural soil carbon).

"Figure 3.28 presents the projected mitigation from forestry,
agriculture, and biomass for the EMF-21 4.5 W/m? stabilization
scenarios, as well as additional scenarios produced by the
MESSAGE and IMAGE models — an approximate 3 W/m?
scenario from Rao and Riahi (2006), a 4.5 W/m? scenario from
Riahi et al. (2006), and approximately 4.5, 3.7, and 2.9 W/m?
scenarios from Van Vuuren et al. (2007) (see Rose et al., 2007,
for a synthesis). While there are clearly different land-based
mitigation pathways being taken across models for the same
stabilization target, and across targets with the same model and
assumptions, some general observations can be made. First,
forestry, agriculture, and biomass are called upon to provide
significant cost-effective mitigation contributions (Rose et
al., 2007). In the short-term (2000-2030), forest, agriculture,
and biomass together could account for cumulative abatement
of 10-65 GtCO,-eq, with 15-60% of the total abatement
considered by the available studies, and forest/agricultural non-
CO, abatement providing at least three quarters of total land
abatement.!8 Over the entire century (2000-2100), cumulative
land-based abatement of approximately 345-1260 GtCO,-eq
is estimated to be cost-effective, accounting for 15-40% of
total cumulative abatement. Forestry, agriculture, and biomass
abatement levels are each projected to grow annually with
relatively stable annual increases in agricultural mitigation and
gradual deployment of biomass mitigation, which accelerates
dramatically in the last half of the century to become the
dominant land-mitigation strategy.

"Development of, among other things, global sectoral land
mitigation models (e.g. Sohngen and Sedjo, 2006), bottom-
up agricultural mitigation costs for specific technologies
(e.g. USEPA, 2006b), and biomass technical potential studies
(e.g. Hoogwijk et al., 2005) has facilitated the formal incorpo-
ration of land mitigation in long-term integrated assessment of
climate change stabilization strategies. Hoogwijk et al. (2005),
for example, estimated the potential of abandoned agricultural
lands for providing biomass for primary energy demand and
identified the technical biomass supply limits of this land type
(e.g. under the SRES A2 scenario, abandoned agricultural lands
could provide for 20% of 2001 total energy demand). Sands and
Leimbach (2003) conducted one of the first studies to explicitly
explore land-based mitigation in stabilization, suggesting that
the total cost of stabilization could be reduced by including land
strategies in the set of eligible mitigation options (energy crops
in this case). The Energy Modelling Forum Study-21 (EMF-21;
De la Chesnaye and Weyant, 2006) was the first coordinated
stabilization modelling effort to include an explicit evaluation
of the relative role of land in stabilization; however, only a
few models participated. Building on their EMF-21 efforts,
some modelling teams have also generated even more recent
stabilization scenarios with revised land modelling. These
studies are conspicuously different in the specifics of their
modelling of land and land-based mitigation (Rose et al., 2007).
Differences in the types of land considered, emissions sources,
and mitigation alternatives and implementation imply different
opportunities and opportunity costs for land-related mitigation;
and, therefore, different outcomes.

abatement is expected to be cost-effective with tighter
stabilization targets and/or higher baseline emissions (e.g. see
the IMAGE 2.3 results for various stabilization targets and the
MESSAGE 4.5 W/m? stabilization results with B2 (EMF-21) and
A2r baselines). Biomass is largely responsible for the additional
abatement; however, agricultural and forestry abatement are
also expected to increase. How they might increase is model
and time dependent. In general, the overall mitigation role of
agricultural abatement of rice methane, livestock methane,
nitrous oxide (enteric and manure) and soil nitrous oxide is
projected to be modest throughout the time horizon, with some
suggestion of increased importance in early decades.

"Anumber of the recent scenarios suggest that biomass energy
alternatives could be essential for stabilization, especially as a
mitigation strategy that combines the terrestrial sequestration
mitigation benefits associated with bio-energy CO, capture and
storage (BECCS), where CO, emissions are captured during
biomass energy combustion for storage in geologic formations
(e.g. Rao and Riahi, 2006; Riahi et a/., 2006; Kurosawa, 2006;
Van Vuuren et al., 2007; USCCSP, 2006). BECCS has also been
suggested as a potential rapid-response prevention strategy for
abrupt climate change. Across stabilization scenarios, absolute
emissions reductions from biomass are projected to grow slowly
in the first half of the century, and then rapidly in the second
half, as new biomass processing and mitigation technologies
become available. Figure 3.28 suggests biomass mitigation of up
to 7 GtCO,/yr in 2050 and 27 GtCO,/yr in 2100, for cumulative
abatement over the century of 115-749 GtCO, (Figure 3.29).
Figure 3.30 shows the amount of commercial biomass primary
energy utilized in various stabilization scenarios. For example, in
2050, the additional biomass energy provides approximately 5—55
EJ for a 2100 stabilization target of 4-5 W/m? and approximately
40-115 EJ for 3.254 W/m2, accounting for about 0-10 and 5—
20% of 2050 total primary energy respectively (USCCSP, 2006;
Rose et al., 2007). Over the century, the additional bio-energy
accounts for 500-6,700 EJ for targets of 4-5 W/m? and 6100-
8000 EJ for targets of 3.254 W/m? (1-9% and 9-13% of total
primary energy, respectively).

deforestation induced by bioenergy crop extensification, as well

"In addition to reducing uncertainty about the maginitude and
timing of land-based mitigation, biomass potential, and regional
potential, there are a number of other important outcomes from
changes in land that should be tracked and reported in order
to properly evaluate long-term land mitigation. Of particular
importance to climate stabilization are the albedo implications
of land-use change, which can offset emissions reducing
land-use change (Betts, 2000; Schaeffer et a/., 2006), as well
as the potential climate-driven changes in forest disturbance
frequency and intensity that could affect the effectiveness of
forest mitigation strategies. Non-climate implications should
also be considered. As shown in the Millennium Ecosystem
Assessment (Carpenter et a/., 2005), land use has implications
for social welfare (e.g. food security, clean water access),
environmental services (water quality, soil retention), and
economic welfare (output prices and production).

"Table 3.6 shows that the vast majority of forest mitigation is
projected to occur in the second half of the century, with tropical
regions in all but one scenario in Table 3.6 assuming a larger
share of global forest sequestration/mitigation than temperate
regions. The IMAGE results from EMF-21 are discussed
separately below. Lower initial carbon prices shift early period
mitigation to the temperate regions since, at that time, carbon
incentives are inadequate for arresting deforestation. The
sectoral models project that tropical forest mitigation activities
are expected to be heavily dominated by land-use change
activities (reduced deforestation and afforestation), while land
management activities (increasing inputs, changing rotation
length, adjusting age or species composition) are expected
to be the slightly dominant strategies in temperate regions.
The current stabilization scenarios model more limited and
aggregated forestry GHG abatement technologies that do not
distinguish the detailed responses seen in the sectoral models.

"In addition to the stabilization scenarios discussed thus far from
integrated assessment and climate economic models, the literature
includes long-term mitigation scenarios from global land sector
economic models (e.g. Sohngen and Sedjo, 2006; Sathaye et al.,
2006; Sands and Leimbach, 2003). Therefore, a comparison is
prudent. The sectoral models use exogenous carbon price paths
to simulate different climate policies and assumptions. It is
possible to compare the stabilization and sectoral scenarios using
these carbon price paths. Stabilization (e.g. EMF-21, discussed
above) and ‘optimal’ (e.g. Sohngen and Mendelsohn, 2003)
climate abatement policies suggest that carbon prices will rise
over time.!9 Table 3.6 compares the forest mitigation outcomes
from stabilization and sectoral scenarios that have similar carbon
price trajectories (Rose et al., 2007).2° Rising carbon prices will
provide incentives for additional forest area, longer rotations, and
more intensive management to increase carbon storage. Higher
effective energy prices might also encourage shorter rotations for
joint production of forest bioenergy feedstocks.

"Quantitative analysis on a global scale on the implications
of climate mitigation for air pollutants such as SO,, NO,, CO,
VOC (volatile organic compounds), BC (black carbon) and
OC (organic carbon), are relatively scarce. Air pollutants and
greenhouse gases are often emitted by the same sources, and
changes in the activity of these sources affect both types of
emissions. Previous studies have focused on purely ancillary
benefits to air pollution that accrue from a climate mitigation
objective, but recently there is a focus on integrating air quality
and climate concerns, thus analyzing the co-benefits of such
policies. Several recent reviews have summarized the issues
related to such benefits (OECD 2000, 2003). They cover
absolute air pollutant emission reductions, monetary value of
reduced pollution, the climatic impacts of such reductions and
the improved health effects due to reduced pollution.

"To summarize, recent stabilization studies have found
that land-use mitigation options (both non-CO, and CO,)
provide cost-effective abatement flexibility in achieving 2100
stabilization targets, in the order of 345-1260 GtCO,-eq
(15-40%) of cumulative abatement over the century. In some
scenarios, increased commercial biomass energy (solid and
liquid fuel) is significant in stabilization, providing 115-749
GtCO,-eq (5—30%) of cumulative abatement and 500-9500 EJ
of additional bio-energy above the baseline over the century
(potentially 1-15% of total primary energy), especially as a net
negative emissions strategy that combines biomass energy with
CO, capture and storage. Agriculture and forestry mitigation
options are projected to be cost effective short-term and long-
term abatement strategies. Global forestry models project
greater additional forest sequestration than found in stabilization
scenarios, a result attributable in part to differences in the
modelling of forest dynamics and general economic feedbacks.

There are broadly two types of national scenarios that focus
on climate mitigation. First, there are the scenarios that study
mitigation options and related costs under a given national
emissions cap and trade regime. The second are the national
scenarios that focus on evaluation of climate mitigation
measures and policies in the absence of specific emissions
targets. The former type of analysis has been mainly undertaken
in the studies in the European Union and Japan. The latter type
has been explored in the USA, Canada and Japan. There is also
an increasing body of literature, mainly in developing countries,
which analyses national GHG emissions in the context of
domestic concerns, such as energy security and environmental
co-benefits. Many of these developing country analyses do not

"air pollution, even in the absence of any climate policies. The
pace of this trend differs significantly across pollutants and
baseline scenarios, and may or may not have an obvious effect
on greenhouse gases. An added aspect of ancillary benefit
measurement is the representation of technological options.
Some emission-control technologies reduce both air pollutants
and greenhouse gases, such as selective catalytic reduction
(SCR) on gas boilers, which reduces not only NO,, but also
NO, CO and CH, (IPCC, 1997). But there are also examples
where, at least in principle, emission-control technologies
aimed at a certain pollutant could increase emissions of other
pollutants. For example, substituting more fuel-efficient diesel
engines for petrol engines might lead to higher PM/black carbon
emissions (Kupiainen and Klimont 2004). Thus estimating
co-benefits of climate mitigation should include adequate
sectoral representation of emission sources, a wide range of
substitution possibilities, assumptions on technological change
and a clear representation of current environmental legislation.

"Anumber of scenario studies have been conducted for various
countries within Europe. These studies explore a wide range
of emission caps, taking into account local circumstances and
potentials for technology implementation. Many of these studies
have used specific burden-sharing allocation schemes, such as
the contraction and convergence (C&C) approach (GCI, 2005)
for calculating the allocation of worldwide emissions to estimate
national emissions ceilings. The UK’s Energy White Paper (DTI,
2003) examined measures to achieve a 60% reduction in CO,
emissions by 2050 as compared to the current level. Several
studies have explored renewable energy options, for example,
the possibility of expanding the share of renewable energy and
the resulting prospects for clean hydrogen production from
renewable energy sources in Germany (Deutscher Bundestag,
2002; Fischedick and Nitsch, 2002; Fischedick et al., 2005).

"Only a few studies have explored the longer-term ancillary
benefits of climate policies. Alceamo (2002) and Mayerhofer
et al. (2002) assess in detail the linkages between regional
air pollution and climate change in Europe. They emphasize
important co-benefits between climate policy and air pollution
control but also indicate that, depending on assumptions, air
pollution policies in Europe will play a greater role in air
pollutant reductions than climate policy. Smith and Wigley
(2006) suggest that there will be a slight reduction in global
sulphur aerosols as a result of long-term multi-gas climate
stabilization. Rao et al. (2005) and Smith and Wigley (2006)
find that climate policies can reduce cumulative BC and OC
emissions by providing the impetus for adoption of cleaner
fuels and advanced technologies. In addition, the inclusion of
co-benefits for air pollution can have significant impacts on the
cost effectiveness of both the climate policy and air pollution
policy under consideration. Van Harmelen et al. (2002) find that
to comply with agreed upon or future policies to reduce regional
air pollution in Europe, mitigation costs are implied, but these
are reduced by 50-70% for SO, and around 50% for NO, when
combined with GHG policies. Similarly, in the shorter-term,
Van Vuuren et al. (2006c) find that for the Kyoto Protocol,
about half the costs of climate policy might be recovered from
reduced air pollution control costs. The exact benefits, however,
critically depend on how the Kyoto Protocol is implemented.

changes and more efficient use of energy lead to significant
reductions of energy requirements across the scenarios as
incorporated in the baselines, indicating that the baseline already

many new technologies and changes that lead to lower relative

less than half the emissions, as compared to the case of no

These measures can also be complemented by efficiency
improvements (e.g. combined cycle natural gas power
plants are more efficient than modern coal power plants)

"Decarbonization denotes the declining average carbon
intensity of primary energy over time. Although decarbonization
of the world’s energy system is comparatively slow (0.3% per
year), the trend has persisted throughout the past two centuries
(Nakicenovic, 1996). The overall tendency towards lower
carbon intensities is due to the continuous replacement of fuels
with high carbon content by those with low carbon content;
however, intensities are currently increasing in some developing
regions. In short- to medium-term scenarios such a declining
tendency for carbon intensity may not be as discernable as across
the longer-term literature, e.g. in the World Energy Outlook
2004 (IEA, 2004), the reference scenario to 2030 shows the
replacement of gas for other fossil fuels as well as cleaner fuels
due to limited growth of nuclear and bioenergy.

"This illustrates the importance of technology and structural
changes, both in reference and mitigation scenarios. However,
this is an aggregated illustration across all scenarios and
different mitigation levels for cumulative emissions. Thus, it is
useful to also give a more specific illustrative example. Figure
3.33 gives such an illustration by showing the importance
of technological change assumptions in both reference and
mitigation scenarios for a 550 ppmv concentration target
based on four SRES scenarios. Such analyses are increasingly
becoming available. For instance, Placet et al. (2004) provide
a detailed study of possible technology development pathways
under climate stabilization for the US government Climate
Change Technology Program. To illustrate the importance of
technological change, actual projected scenario values in the
original SRES no-climate policy scenarios are compared with a
hypothetical case with frozen 1990 structures and technologies
for both energy supply and end-use. The difference (denoted
by a grey shaded area in Figure 3.33) illustrates the impact of
technological change, which leads to improved efficiency and
“‘decarbonization’ in energy systems already incorporated into
the baseline emission scenario.

"The impacts of technological options leading to emission
reductions are illustrated by the colour-shaded areas in Figure
3.33, regrouped into three categories: demand reductions
(e.g. through deployment of more efficient end-use technologies,
such as lighting or vehicles), fuel switching (substituting
high-GHG-emitting technologies for low- or zero-emitting
technologies such as renewables or nuclear), and finally, CO,
capture and storage technologies. The mix in the mitigative
technology portfolio required to reduce emissions from the
reference scenario level to that consistent with the illustrative
550 ppmv stabilization target varies as a function of the baseline
scenario underlying the model calculations (shown in Figure
3.33), as well as with the degree of stringency of the stabilization
target adopted (not shown in Figure 3.33). An interesting finding
from a large number of modelling studies is that scenarios with
higher degrees of technology diversification (e.g. scenario A1B
in Figure 3.33) also lead to a higher degree of flexibility with
respect of meeting alternative climate (e.g. stabilization) targets
and generally also to lower overall costs compared with less
diversified technology scenarios. This illustrative example also
confirms the conclusion reached in Section 3.3 that was based

post-2001 scenarios include a few with significantly more rapid

"The highest rates of decarbonization of energy (up to 2.5%

a complete transition in the energy system away from carbon-
intensive fossil fuels. Clearly, the majority of these scenarios
are intervention scenarios, although some non-intervention
scenarios show drastic reductions in CO, intensities due to
reasons other than climate policies (e.g. the combination
of sustainable development policies and technology push
measures to promote renewable hydrogen systems). The
relatively fast decarbonization rate of intervention scenarios

Note: Modelling studies enable experts to calculate the economic value of technology improvements that increase particularly drastically with increasing stringency of
stabilization targets (750, 650, 500, and 450 ppmv, respectively) imposed on a reference scenario (modelling after the IS92a scenario in this particular modelling study).
Detailed model representation of technological interdependencies and competition and substitution is needed for a comprehensive assessment of the economic value
of technology improvements. Left panel: cost savings (billions of 1996 US$) compared to the reference scenario when lowering the costs of solar photovoltaics (PV)
from a reference value of 9 US cents per kWh (top) by 1, 3, 4, and 6 cents/kWh, respectively. For instance, the value of reducing PV costs from 9 to 3 cents per kWh
could amount to up to 1.5 trillion US$ in an illustrative 550 ppmv stabilization scenario compared to the reference scenario in which costs remain at 9 cents/kWh).
Right panel: cost savings resulting from availability of an ever larger and diversified portfolio of carbon capture and sequestration technologies. For instance, adding
soil carbon sequestration to the portfolio of carbon capture and sequestration technology options (forest-sector measures were not included in the study) reduces
costs by 1.1 trillion US$ in an illustrative 450 ppmv stabilization scenario. Removing all carbon capture sequestration technologies would triple the costs of stabilization
for all concentration levels analyzed.

technologies leads to learning benefits and lower costs as
diffusion progresses. In contrast, scenarios with exogenous

"All models indicate that real carbon prices for stabilization
targets rise with time in the early years, with some models
showing a decline in the optimal price after 2050 due to the
accumulated effects of LBD and positive spillovers on economic
growth. Another robust result is that ITC can reduce costs when
models include low carbon energy sources (such as renewables,
nuclear, and carbon capture and sequestration), as well as energy
efficiency and energy savings. Finally, policy uncertainty is
seen as an issue. Long-term and credible abatement targets
and policies will reduce some of the uncertainties around the

"Chapter 2, Section 2.7.2 includes a discussion of the barriers

to technology transfer vary according to the specific context
from sector to sector and can manifest themselves differently
in developed and developing countries, and in economies-in-
transition (EITs). These barriers range froma lack of information;
insufficient human capabilities; political and economic barriers
(such as the lack of capital, high transaction costs, lack of full
cost pricing, and trade and policy barriers); institutional and
structural barriers; lack of understanding of local needs; business
limitations (such as risk aversion in financial institutions);
institutional limitations (such as insufficient legal protection);
and inadequate environmental codes and standards.
"	Text
"Other recent work also confirms these findings. For example,
Manne and Richels (2004) and Goulder (2004) also found that
ITC lowers mitigation costs and that more extensive reductions
in GHGs are justified than with exogenous technical change.
Nakicenovic and Riahi (2003) noted how the assumption about
the availability of future technologies was a strong driver of
stabilization costs. Edmonds et al. (2004a) studied stabilization
at 550 ppmv CO, in the SRES B2 world using the MiniCAM
model and showed a reduction in costs of a factor of 2.5 in 2100
using a baseline incorporating technical change. Edmonds et
al. consider advanced technology development to be far more
important as a driver of emission reductions than carbon taxes.
Weyant (2004) concluded that stabilization will require the
large-scale development of new energy technologies, and that
costs would be reduced if many technologies are developed
in parallel and there is early adoption of policies to encourage
technology development.
"	Text
"However, this influence is itself largely due to the different
assumptions made about technological change in the baseline
scenarios. Gritsevskyi and Nakicenovic (2000) identified some
53 clusters of least-cost technologies, allowing for endogenous
technological learning with uncertainty. This suggests that a
decarbonized economy may not cost any more than a carbon-
intensive one, if technology learning curves are taken into
account. Other key findings are that there is a large diversity
across alternative energy technology strategies, a finding that
was confirmed in IMCP (Edenhofer et a/., 2006). These results
suggest that it is not possible to choose an ‘optimal’ direction
for energy system development. Some modelling reported
in the TAR suggests that a reduction (up to 5 GtC a year) by
2020 (some 50% of baseline projections) might be achieved by
current technologies, half of the reduction at no direct cost, the
other half at direct costs of less than 100 US$/tC-equivalent
(27 US$/tCO,-eq).

"A key question for policy is what combination of short-term
and long-term actions will minimize the total costs of climate
change, in whatever form these costs are expressed, across
mitigation, adaptation and the residual climate impacts that
society is either prepared or forced to tolerate. Although there
are different views on the form and dynamics of such trade-
offs in climate policies, there is a consensus that they should
be aligned with (sustainable) development policies, since the
latter determine the capacity to mitigate and to adapt in the
future (TAR, Hourcade and Shukla, 2001). In all cases, policy
decisions will have to be made with incomplete understanding
of the magnitude and timing of climate change, of its likely
consequences, and of the cost and effectiveness of response
measures.

"Limited treatment of adaptation in climate policy assessments
is still a problem and a number of reasons explain this. First,
the focus of the international climate change negotiations
has largely been on mitigation (perhaps because attention to
adaptation could be viewed as ‘giving up’ on mitigation) even
though the importance of adaptation is underlined in Article 4
of the UNFCCC and Article 10 of the Kyoto Protocol. Second,
adaptation is largely undertaken at the local scale, by individual
households, farmers, companies or local governments; it is thus
difficult to target through coordinated international incentives,
and is more complicated to handle quantitatively by models
in global scenarios. Third, it is difficult to generalize the ways
that individuals or communities are likely to adapt to specific
impacts. However, the literature is evolving quickly and recent
work is available in a number of regions; for example, in Finland
(Carter et al., 2005), the UK (West and Gawith, 2005), Canada
(Cohen et al., 2004) and the USA (e.g. California, Hayhoe et
al., 2004).
"	Text
"Both the magnitude and the sign of the indirect macro-
economic impacts of climate change are conditional upon the
growth dynamics of the countries concerned. When confronted
by the same mitigation policies and the same climate change
impacts, economies experiencing strong disequilibrium
(including ‘poverty traps’) and large market and institutional
imperfections will not react in the same way as countries that
are on a steady and high economic growth pathway. The latter
are near what economists call their ‘production frontier’ (the
maximum of production attainable at a given point in time);
the former are more vulnerable to any climatic shock or badly
"	Text
"To summarize, adaptation and mitigation are thus increasingly
viewed as complementary (on the global scale), whilst locally
there are examples of both synergies and conflicts between
the two (IPCC, 2007b, Chapter 18). Less action on mitigation
raises the risk of greater climate-change-induced damages
to economic development and natural systems and implies
a greater need for adaptation. Some authors maintain that
adaptation and mitigation are substitutes, because of competition
for funds, whilst others claim that such tradeoffs occur only at
the margin when considering incremental temperature change
and incremental policy action, because for large temperature
changes mitigation is always cheaper than adaptation.
"	Text
"calibrated mitigation policies, but symmetrically offer more
opportunities for synergies between mitigation, adaptation and
development policies (Shukla er al., 2006). On the adaptation
side for example, Tol and Dowlatabadi (2001) demonstrate
that there is significant potential to reduce vulnerability to the
spread of malaria in Africa. In some circumstances, mitigation
measures can be aligned with development policies and alleviate
important sources of vulnerability in these countries, such as
dependency on oil imports or local pollution. But this involves
transition costs over the coming 10—20 years (higher domestic
energy prices, higher investments in the energy sector), which
in turn suggests opportunities for international cooperative
mechanisms to minimize these costs.
"	Text
"Despite the scarcity of global systematic assessments (Tol,
2005a), some interesting insights into the interaction between
adaptation and mitigation emerge from recent regional-scale
studies. Some adaptation measures are ‘no-regret’ measures
and should be undertaken anyway (Agrawala, 2005), such as
preservation of mangroves in coastal zones, which provide a
buffer for increased coastal flood risk due to climate change
and help to maintain healthy marine ecosystems (Nicholls et
al., 2006). A few may be synergistic with mitigation (Bosello,
2005) such as investing in more efficient buildings that will
limit human vulnerability to increasingly frequent heatwaves
and also reduce energy use, hence emissions. But many
adaptation options involve net costs with a risk of committing
to irreversible and misplaced investment given the considerable
uncertainty about climate change at a local scale. Given this
uncertainty, and the fact that learning about adaptation to
climate change imposes some costs and takes time (Kelly et al.,
2005), mis-allocation of investments may occur, or the rate of
long-term investment in adaptation strategies may slow (Kokic
et al., 2005; Kelly et al., 2005).
"	Text
"Finally, the interactions between adaptation and mitigation
are intertwined with development pathways. A key issue is
to understand at what point (over)investment in mitigation or
adaptation might limit funds available for development, and
thus reduce future adaptive capacity (Sachs, 2004; Tol, 2005a;
Tol and Yohe, 2006). Another issue concerns the point at
which climate change damages, and the associated investment
in adaptation, could crowd out more productive investments
later and harm development (Kemfert, 2002; Bosello and
Zhang, 2005; Kemfert and Schumacher, 2005). The answer
to these questions depends upon modelling assumptions that
drive repercussions in other sectors of the economy and other
regions and the potential impacts on economic growth. These
are ‘higher-order’ social costs of climate change from a series
of climate-change-induced shocks; they include the relative
influence of: a) the cross-sectoral interactions across all major
sectors and regions; b) a crowding out effect that slows down
capital accumulation and technical progress, especially if
technical change is endogenous. These indirect impacts reduce
development and adaptive capacity and may be in the same
order of magnitude, or greater than, the direct impact of climate
change (Fankhauser and Tol, 2005; Roson and Tol, 2006;
Kemfert, 2006).
"	Text
"Bosello (2005) shows complementarity between adaptation,
mitigation and investment in R&D, whilst others consider
these as substitutes (Tol, 2005a). Schneider and Lane (2006)
consider that mitigation and adaptation only trade off for small
temperature increments where adaptation might be cheaper,
whereas for larger temperature increases mitigation is always
the cheaper option. Goklany (2003) promotes the view that
the contribution by climate change to hunger, malaria, coastal
flooding, and water stress (as measured by populations at risk)
is small compared to that of non-climate-change-related factors,
and that through the 2080s, efforts to reduce vulnerability
would be more cost-effective in reducing these problems than
mitigation. This analysis neglects critical thresholds at the
regional level (such as the temperature ceiling on feasibility of
regional crop growth) and at the global level (such as the onset
of ice sheet melting or release of methane from permafrost),
and, like many others studies, it neglects the impacts of
extreme weather events. It also promotes a very optimistic
view of adaptive capacity, which is increasingly challenged
in the literature (Tompkins and Adger, 2005). An adaptation-
only policy scenario in the coming decades leads to an even
greater challenge for adaptation in decades to follow, owing to
the inertia of the climate system. In the absence of mitigation,
temperature rises will be much greater than would otherwise
occur with pusuant impacts on economic development (IPCC,
2007b, Chapter 19.3.7; Stern 2006). Hence adaptation alone is
insufficient to avoid the serious risks due to climate change (see
Table 3.11; also IPCC, 2007b, Chapter 19, Table 19.1).

the environmental consequences of mitigation strategies
is to look at links between various stabilization levels for
concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and the
global mean temperature change relative to a particular baseline.
A second step is to link levels of temperature change and key
vulnerabilities. Climate models indicate significant uncertainty
at both levels. Figure 3.38 shows CO,-eq concentrations that
would limit warming at equilibrium below the temperatures
indicated above pre-industrial levels, for ‘best estimate’ climate
sensitivity, and for the likely range of climate sensitivity (see
Meehl et al., 2007, Section 10.7, and Table 10.8; and the notes to
Figure 3.38). It also shows the corresponding radiative forcing
levels and their relationship to equilibrium temperature and
CO,-eq concentrations. The table and the figure illustrate how
lower temperature constraints require lower stabilization levels,

than the ‘best estimate’ and is taken into account, the constraint
becomes more stringent. These more stringent constraints lower
the risks of exceeding the threshold.

"above pre-industrial levels implies the most stringent of the
category I scenarios, with emissions peaking in no more than
the next 10 years, again if the higher likely values of climate
sensitivity are taken into account. Using the ‘best estimate’
of climate sensitivity (i.e. the estimated mode) as a guide for
establishing targets, implies the need for less stringent emission
constraints. This ‘best estimate’ assumption shows that the
most stringent (category I) scenarios could limit global mean
temperature increases to 2°C—2.4°C above pre-industrial levels,
at equilibrium, requiring emissions to peak within 10 years.
Similarly, limiting temperature increases to 2°C above pre-
industrial levels can only be reached at the lowest end of the
concentration interval found in the scenarios of category I (i.e.
about 450 ppmv CO,-eq using ‘best estimate’ assumptions).
By comparison, using the same ‘best estimate’ assumptions,
category II scenarios could limit the increase to 2.8°C—3.2°C
above pre-industrial levels at equilibrium, requiring emissions
to peak within the next 25 years, whilst category IV scenarios
could limit the increase to 3.2°C-4°C above pre-industrial at
equilibrium requiring emissions to peak within the next 55
years. Note that Table 3.10 category IV scenarios could result
in temperature increases as high as 6.1°C above pre-industrial
levels, when the likely range for the value of climate sensitivity
is taken into account. Hence, setting policy on the basis of a
‘best estimate’ climate sensitivity accepts a significant risk
of exceeding the temperature thresholds, since the climate
sensitivity could be higher than the best estimate.

Notes:

1. IPCC (2007a) finds that the climate sensitivity is likely to be in the range 2°C -4.5°C, with a ‘best estimate’ of about 3°C, very unlikely to be less than 1.5°C and
values substantially higher than 4.5°C ‘cannot be excluded’ (IPCC (2007a, SPM).

2. The simple relationship T., = Toxco, x In({CO,/280)/In(2) is used (see Meehl et al. (2007), Section 10.7, and Table 10.8), with upper and lower values of Toxco, of2
and 4.5°C.

3. Non-linearities in the feedbacks (including e.g. ice cover and carbon cycle) may cause time dependence of the effective climate sensitivity, as well as leading to
larger uncertainties for greater warming levels. This likelihood level is consistent with the IPCC Working Group | assessment of climate sensitivity, see Note 1, and
drawn from additional consideration of Box 10.2, Figure 2, in IPCC (2007a).

"The italic text in Table 3.11 highlights examples of avoided
impacts derived from ensuring that temperatures are constrained
to any particular temperature range compared to a higher one.
For example, significant benefits result from constraining
temperature change to not more than 1.6°C—2.6°C above
pre-industrial levels. These benefits would include lowering
(with different levels of confidence) the risk of: widespread
deglaciation of the Greenland Ice Sheet; avoiding large-scale
transformation of ecosystems and degradation of coral reefs;
preventing terrestrial vegetation becoming a carbon source;
constraining species extinction to between 10-40%; preserving
many unique habitats (see IPCC, 2007b, Chapter 4, Table 4.1
and Figure 4.5) including much of the Arctic; reducing increases
in flooding, drought, and fire; reducing water quality declines,

reducing the risks of extreme weather events, and of at least
partial deglaciation of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS),

insights into the influence of short-term decisions on long-

"For example, Toth et al. (2002) draw on climate impact
response functions (CIRFs) by Fiissel and van Minnen (2001)
that use detailed biophysical models to estimate regionally
specific, non-monetized impacts for different sectors (i.e.
agricultural production, forestry, water runoff and biome
changes). They show that the business-as-usual scenario of
GHG emissions (which resembles the SRES A2 scenario)
to 2040 precludes the possibility of limiting the worldwide
transformation of ecosystems to 30% or less, even with very
high willingness to pay for the mitigation of GHG emissions
afterwards. Some applications of guardrail analyses assess the
relationship between emission pathways and abrupt change
such as thermohaline circulation (THC) collapse (Rahmstorf
and Zickfeld, 2005). The latter study concludes that stringent
mitigation policy reduces the probability of THC collapse but
cannot entirely avoid the risk of shutdown.

"Another focus ofsensitivity analysis is on mitigation scenarios
that overshoot and eventually return to a given stabilization or
temperature target (Kheshgi, 2004; Wigley, 2005; Harvey, 2004;
Izrael and Semenov, 2005; Kheshgi et a/., 2005; Meinshausen
et al., 2006). Schneider and Mastrandrea (2005) find that this
risk of exceeding a threshold of 2°C above pre-industrial levels
is increased by 70% for an overshoot scenario stabilizing at 500
ppmv CO,-eq (as compared to a scenario stabilizing at 500 ppmv
CO,-eq). Such overshoot scenarios are likely to be necessary if
there is a decision to achieve stablization of GHG concentrations
close to (or at) today’s levels. They are indeed likely to lower
the costs of mitigation but, in turn, raise the risk of exceeding
such thresholds (Keller et al., 2006; Schneider and Lane, 2004)
and may limit the ability to adapt by increasing the rate of
climate change, at least temporarily (Hare and Meinshausen,
2006). O’Neill and Oppenheimer (2004) find that the transient
temperature up to 2100 is equally, or more, controlled by the
pathway to stabilization than by the stabilization target, and that
overshooting can lead to a peak temperature increase that is
higher than in the long-term (equilibrium) warming.
"	Text
"The last and important contribution of this approach is to
test the sensitivity of results to carbon cycle and climate change
feedbacks (Cox et al., 2000; Friedlingstein et al., 2001; Matthews,
2005) and other factors that may affect carbon cycle dynamics,
such as deforestation (Gitz and Ciais, 2003). For example, carbon
cycle feedbacks amplify warming (Meehl et al., 2007) and are
omitted from most other studies that thus underestimate the risks
of exceeding (or overshooting) temperature targets for a given
effort of mitigation in the energy sector only. This could increase
warming by up to 1°C in 2100, according to a simple model
(Meehl et a/., 2007). The amplification, together with further
potential amplification due to feedbacks of uncertain magnitude,
such as the potential release of methane from permafrost, peat
bogs and seafloor clathrates (Meehl et al., 2007) are also not
included in the analysis presented in Figure 3.38 and Table
3.10. This analysis reflects only known feedbacks for which
the magnitude can be estimated and are included in General
Circulation Models (GCMs). Hence, scenario and sensitivity
analysis shows that the risks of exceeding a given temperature
threshold for a given temperature target may be higher than that
shown in Table 3.10 and Figure 3.38.

that climate damages and SCC may be over-estimated due to
the omission of possible amenity benefits in warmer climates or
high-latitude regions (Maddison 2001) and possible agricultural
benefits. However, overall, it is likely that current SCC estimates
are understated due to the omission of significant impacts that
have not yet been monetized (IPCC, 2007b, Chapters 19 and

"Some argue that it is necessary to specify more precisely why
certain impacts are undesirable and to comprehensively itemize
the economic consequences of climate change in monetary
terms. The credibility of such efforts has often been questioned,
given the uncertainty surrounding climate impacts and the
efficacy of societal responses to them, plus the controversial
meaning of a monetary metric across different regions and
generations (Jacoby, 2004). This explains why few economists
have taken the step of monetizing global climate impacts. At
the time of the TAR, only three such comprehensive studies had
been published (Mendelsohn et al., 2000; Nordhaus and Boyer,
2000; and Tol, 2002a, 2002b). Their estimates ranged from
negligible to 1.5% of the GDP for a global mean temperature
rise of +2.5°C and Nordhaus and Boyer carefully warned:
“Along the economically efficient emission path, the long-
run global average temperature after 500 years is projected to
increase 6.2°C over the 1900 global climate. While we have
only the foggiest idea of what this would imply in terms of
ecological, economic, and social outcomes, it would make the
most thoughtful people, even economists, nervous to induce
such a large environmental change. Given the potential for
unintended and potentially disastrous consequences....’

"Progress has been made since the TAR in assessing the
impacts of climate change. Nonetheless, as noted in Watkiss
et al. (2005), estimates of the social costs of carbon (SCC)
in the recent literature still reflect an incomplete subset of
relevant impacts; many significant impacts have not yet been
monetized (see also IPCC, 2007b; for SCC see IPCC (2007b,
Section 20.6) and others are calibrated in numeraires that may
defy monetization for some time to come. Existing reviews of
available SCC estimates show that they span several orders
of magnitude — ranges that reflect uncertainties in climate
sensitivity, response lags, discount rates, the treatment of equity,
the valuation of economic and non-economic impacts, and the
treatment of possible catastrophic losses (IPCC, 2007b, Chapter
20). The majority of available estimates in the literature also
capture only impacts driven by lower levels of climate change
(e.g. 3°C above 1990 levels). IPCC (2007b) highlights available
estimates of SCC that run from -3 to 95 US$ /tCO, from one
survey, but also note that another survey includes a few estimates
as high as 400 US$/tCO, (IPCC, 2007b, Chapter 20, ES and
Section 20.6.1). However the lower boundary of this range
includes studies where climate change is presumed to be low
and aggregate benefits accrue. Moreover, none of the aggregate
estimates reflect the significant differences in impacts that will
be felt across different regions; nor do they capture any of the
social costs of other greenhouse gases. A more recent estimate
by Stern (2006) is at the high end of these estimates (at 85 US$/
tCO,) because an extremely low discount rate (of 0.1%) is used
in calculating damages that include additional costs attributed
to abrupt change and increases in global mean temperature for

of greenhouse gas abatement.

The planner maximizes total welfare under given economic,

might choose to delay action and take the (small) risk of
triggering significant and possibly irreversible abrupt change
impacts over the long-term. If society is averse to risk — that
is, interested in avoiding worst-case outcomes — it would
prefer hedging behaviour, implying more intense and earlier
mitigation efforts.

"In an economically-efficient mitigation response, the
marginal costs of mitigation should be equated to the marginal
benefits of emission reduction. The marginal benefits are the
avoided damages for an additional tonne of carbon abated within
a given emission pathway, also known as the SCC. As discussed
in Section 3.6, both sides of this equation are uncertain, which
is why a sequential or iterative decision-making framework,
with progressive resolution of information, is needed. Despite a
paucity of analytical results in this area, it is possible to draw on
today’s literature to make a first comparison between the range
of SCC estimates and the range of marginal costs of mitigation
across different scenarios. IPCC (2007b, Chapter 20) reviews
ranges of SCC from available literature. Allowing for a range
of SCC between 4-95 US$/tCO, (14-350 USS$/tC from Tol
(2005b) median and 95‘ percentile estimates) and assuming a
2.4% per year increase (IPCC, 2007b, Chapter 20), produces a

"In the case of certainty, the choice of emissions pathway can
be seen as a pure GHG budget problem, depending on a host
of parameters (discounting, technical change, socio-economic
inertia, carbon cycle and climate dynamics, to name the most
critical) that shape its allocation across time. The IPCC Second
and Third Assessment Reports demonstrated why this approach
is an oversimplification and therefore misleading. Policymakers
are not required to make once-and-for-all decisions, binding
their successors over very long time horizons, and there will be
ample opportunities for mid-course adjustments in the light of
new information. The choice of short-term abatement rate (and
adaptation strategies) involves balancing the economic risks of
rapid abatement now and the reshaping of the capital stock that
could later be proven unnecessary, against the corresponding
risks of delay. Delay may entail more drastic adaptation
measures and more rapid emissions reductions later to avoid
serious damages, thus necessitating premature retirement of
future capital stock or taking the risk of losing the option of
reaching a certain target altogether (IPCC, 1996b, SPM).

Predictive capacity: studies finding efficient adaptation

Higher costs are found if one considers the volatility of
climate signals and transaction costs. For agriculture,
Parry et al. (2004) shows the costs of a mismatch between
expectations and real climate change (sunk costs, value of
real estates, and of capital stock).

Geographic downscaling: using a geographic-economic
cross-sectional (1990) database, Nordhaus (2006a)
concludes that this downscaling leads to increased damage
costs, from previous 0.7% estimates to 3% of world output

The propagation of local economic and social shocks:
this blurs the distinction between winners and losers. The
magnitude of this type of indirect impact depends on the
existence of compensation mechanisms, including direct

"Therefore, with a noticeable acceleration in the last few years,
the scientific community has concentrated on assessing climate

the influence of the uncertainty about climate sensitivity on

corresponding stringency of the climatic constraints, either
through sensitivity analyses (Bohringer et al., 2006; Caldeira

"On the whole, these studies reach similar conclusions,
outlining the significance of uncertainty about climate sensitivity.
Ambrosi et al. (2003) demonstrates the information value of
climate sensitivity before 2030, given the significant economic
regrets from a precautionary climate policy in the presence of
uncertainty about this parameter. Such information might not be
available soon (i.e. at least 50 years could be necessary — Kelly
et al., 2000). Yohe et al. (2004) thus conclude: ‘uncertainty
(about climate sensitivity) is the reason for acting in the near
term and uncertainty cannot be used as a justification for doing
nothing’.

"A few authors analyze the trade-off between a costly
acceleration of mitigation costs and a (temporary) overshoot of
targets, and the climate impacts of this overshoot. Ambrosi et al.
(2003) did so through a willingness to pay for not interfering with
the climate system. They show that allowing for overshoot of an
ex-ante target significantly decreases the required acceleration
of decarbonization and the peak of abatement costs, but does
not drastically change the level of abatement in the first period.
However, the overshoot may significantly increase climate
change damages as discussed above (see Section 3.5). Another
result is that higher climate sensitivity magnifies the rate of
warming, which in turn exacerbates adaptation difficulties, and
leads to stringent abatement policy recommendations for the
coming decades (Ambrosi, 2007). This result is robust for the
choice of discount rate; uncertainty about the rate constraint
is proven to be more important for short-term decisions than
uncertainty about the magnitude of warming. Therefore,
research should be aimed at better characterizing early climate

"The choice between indicators of the mitigation benefits
reflects a judgment on the quality of the available information
and its ability to serve as a common basis in the decision-making
process. Actually the necessary time to obtain comprehensive,
non-controversial estimates of climate policy benefits imposes
a trade-off between the measurement accuracy of indicators
describing the benefits of climate policies (which diminishes
as one moves down the causal chain from global warming to
impacts and as one downscales simulation results) and their
relevance, that is their capacity to translate information that
policymakers may desire, ideally prior to a fully-informed
decision. Using a set of environmental constraints is simply
a way of considering that, beyond such constraints, the threat
of climate change might become unacceptable; in a monetary-
metric, or valuation approach, the same expectation can be
translated through using damage curves with dangerous
thresholds. The only serious source of divergence between the
two approaches is the discount rate. Within a cost-effectiveness
framework, environmental constraints are not influenced by
discounting. Conversely, in a cost-benefit framework, some
benefits occur later than costs and thus have a lower weighting
when discounted.

"What is remarkable in cost-benefit studies of the optimal
timing of mitigation is that the shape (or curvature) of the
damage function matters even more than the ultimate level of
damages — a fact long established by Peck and Teisberg (1995).
With damage functions exhibiting smooth and regular damages
(such as power functions with integer exponents or polynomial
functions), GHG abatement is postponed. This is because,
for several decades, the temporal rate of increase in marginal
climate change damage remains low enough to conclude that
investments to accelerate the rate of economic growth are more
socially profitable that investing in abatement.

based on a recursive dynamic, allowing mitigation options
to be adopted based only on today’s carbon price. Recursive
dynamic models tend to show higher carbon prices to achieve
the same emission reductions as in inter-temporal optimization
models, because emitters do not have the foresight to take
early mitigation actions that may have been cheaper (for more
discussion on modelling approaches, refer to Section 3.3.3).

"This result changes if singularities in the damage curve
represent non-linear events. Including even small probabilities
of catastrophic ‘nasty surprises’ may substantially alter optimal
short-term carbon taxes (Mastrandea and Schneider, 2004;
Azar and Lindgren, 2003). Many other authors report similar
findings (Azar and Schneider, 2001; Howarth, 2003; Dumas
and Ha-Duong, 2005; Baranzini et al., 2003), whilst Hall and
Behl (2006) suggest a damage function reflecting climate
instability needs to include discontinuities in capital stock
and the rate of return on capital, and hysteresis with respect to
heating and cooling — resulting in a non-convex optimization
function such that economic optimization models can provide
no solution. But these surprises may be caused by forces other
than large catastrophic events. They may also be triggered by
smooth climate changes that exceed a vulnerability threshold
(e.g. shocks to agricultural systems in developing countries
leading to starvation) or by policies that lead to maladaptations
to climate change.

"In the case of an irreversible THC collapse, Keller et al.
(2004) point out another seemingly paradoxical result: if a
climate catastrophe seems very likely within a short-term
time horizon, it might be economically sound to accept its
consequences instead of investing in expensive mitigation
to avoid the inevitable. This shows that temporary overshoot
of a pre-determined target may be preferable to bearing
the social costs of an exaggerated reduction in emission, as
well as the need to be attentive to ‘windows of opportunity’
for abatement action. The converse argument is that timely
abatement measures, especially in the case of ITC, can reduce
long-term mitigation costs and avoid some of the catastrophic
events. In this respect, limited differences in GMT curves for
different emissions pathways within coming decades are often
misinterpreted. It does not imply that early mitigation activities
would make no material difference to long-term warming. On
the contrary, if the social value of the damages is high enough to
justify deep emission cuts decades from now, then early action
is necessary due to inertia in socio-economic systems. For

"Across all the models, the long-term target in the stabilization
scenarios could be met through the mitigation of multiple
greenhouse gases (CO, CHy, N,O and high-GWP gases).
However the specific mitigation options and the treatment of

only some of the models include carbon capture and storage

anywhere in the world, according to the principle of least cost).
Limiting the degree of flexibility in these mitigation scenarios,
such as limiting mitigation only to CO,, removing major
countries or regions from undertaking mitigation, or both, will
increase carbon prices, all else being equal. Second, the carbon
prices of realizing these levels of mitigation increase in the
time horizon beyond 2030. See Figure 3.25 for an illustration
of carbon prices across longer time horizons from top-down
scenarios. Third, at the economic sector level, estimated
emission reduction for all greenhouse gases varies significantly
across the different model scenarios, in part because each model
uses sector definitions specific to that type of model.

"Table 3.13 illustrates the amount of global GHG mitigation
reported by sector for the year 2030 across a range of multi-
gas stabilization targets. Across the higher Category IV
stabilization target scenarios, emission reductions of 3-31%
from the reference case emissions across all greenhouse gases
can be achieved for a carbon price of 2-57 US$/tCO,-eq. The
results from the POLES models fall into the higher end of the
price range, in part due to the recursive dynamic nature of the
model, and also due to its shorter time horizon over which to
plan. The results from the GRAPE model fall into the lower
end of the price range, which is the only inter-temporally
optimizing model shown in the higher stabilization scenarios.
In the GRAPE results, only 3% of the emissions are reduced
by 2030, implying that the majority of the mitigation necessary
to meet the target is undertaken beyond 2030. In scenarios

levels) are reported on a ‘point of emission basis’ (emissions
are reported for the sectors in which the emissions occur).
For example, the efficiency improvements in end-use sectors
for electricity lead to reductions in the energy supply sector.
Likewise, using bio-energy leads to emission reductions in the
end-use sectors, but at the same time (in some models) may lead
to increases in emissions for forestry, due to associated land-
use changes. The latter may explain differences in the way that
data from top-down models are represented elsewhere in this
report, as here (in most cases) only the emission changes from
mitigation measures in the forestry sector itself are reported. It
also explains why the potential in some of the end-use sectors is
relatively small, as emission reductions from electricity savings
are reported elsewhere.

"Energy access for all will require making available basic and
affordable energy services using a range of energy resources
and innovative conversion technologies while minimizing
GHG emissions, adverse effects on human health, and other
local and regional environmental impacts. To accomplish this
would require governments, the global energy industry and
society as a whole to collaborate on an unprecedented scale.

"The wide range of energy sources and carriers that provide
energy services need to offer long-term security of supply,
be affordable and have minimal impact on the environment.
However, these three government goals often compete. There
are sufficient reserves of most types of energy resources to
last at least several decades at current rates of use when using
technologies with high energy-conversion efficient designs. How
best to use these resources in an environmentally acceptable
manner while providing for the needs of growing populations
and developing economies is a great challenge.

"There are regional and societal variations in the demand
for energy services. The highest per-capita demand is by
those living in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) economies, but currently, the most rapid
growth is in many developing countries. Energy access, equity
and sustainable development are compromised by higher and
rapidly fluctuating prices for oil and gas. These factors may
increase incentives to deploy carbon-free and low-carbon
energy technologies, but conversely, could also encourage the
market uptake of coal and cheaper unconventional hydrocarbons
and technologies with consequent increases in carbon dioxide
(CO,) emissions.

"Global dependence on fossil fuels has led to the release
of over 1100 GtCO, into the atmosphere since the mid-19th
century. Currently, energy-related GHG emissions, mainly from
fossil fuel combustion for heat supply, electricity generation and
transport, account for around 70% of total emissions including
carbon dioxide, methane and some traces of nitrous oxide
(Chapter 1). To continue to extract and combust the world’s
rich endowment of oil, coal, peat, and natural gas at current
or increasing rates, and so release more of the stored carbon
into the atmosphere, is no longer environmentally sustainable,
unless carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technologies
currently being developed can be widely deployed (high

"Annual total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions arising from
the global energy supply sector continue to increase. Combustion
of fossil fuels continues to dominate a global energy market
that is striving to meet the ever-increasing demand for heat,
electricity and transport fuels. GHG emissions from fossil fuels
have increased each year since the IPCC 2001 Third Assessment
Report (TAR) (IPCC,2001), despite greater deployment of
low- and zero-carbon technologies, (particularly those utilizing
renewable energy); the implementation of various policy support
mechanisms by many states and countries; the advent of carbon
trading in some regions, and a substantial increase in world
energy commodity prices. Without the near-term introduction of
supportive and effective policy actions by governments, energy-
related GHG emissions, mainly from fossil fuel combustion,
are projected to rise by over 50% from 26.1 GtCO,eq (7.1 GtC)
in 2004 to 37-40 GtCO, (10.1-10.9 GtC) by 2030. Mitigation
has therefore become even more challenging.

Conventional oil reserves will eventually peak as will
natural gas reserves, but it is uncertain exactly when and
what will be the nature of the transition to alternative liquid
fuels such as coal-to-liquids, gas-to-liquids, oil shales, tar
sands, heavy oils, and biofuels. It is still uncertain how and
to what extent these alternatives will reach the market and
what the resultant changes in global GHG emissions will be
as a result.

Conventional natural gas reserves are more abundant
in energy terms than conventional oil, but they are also
distributed less evenly across regions. Unconventional
gas resources are also abundant, but future economic
development of these resources is uncertain.

Coal is unevenly distributed, but remains abundant. It can be
converted to liquids, gases, heat and power, although more
intense utilization will demand viable CCS technologies if
GHG emissions from its use are to be limited.

There is a trend towards using energy carriers with increased
efficiency and convenience, particularly away from solid
fuels to liquid and gaseous fuels and electricity.

Nuclear energy, already at about 7% of total primary
energy, could make an increasing contribution to carbon-
free electricity and heat in the future. The major barriers
are: long-term fuel resource constraints without recycling;
economics; safety; waste management; — security;
proliferation, and adverse public opinion.

Renewable energy sources (with the exception of large
hydro) are widely dispersed compared with fossil fuels,
which are concentrated at individual locations and require
distribution. Hence, renewable energy must either be used
in a distributed manner or concentrated to meet the higher
energy demands of cities and industries.

Non-hydro renewable energy-supply __ technologies,
particularly solar, wind, geothermal and biomass, are
currently small overall contributors to global heat and
electricity supply, but are the most rapidly increasing. Costs,
as well as social and environmental barriers, are restricting
this growth. Therefore, increased rates of deployment may
need supportive government policies and measures.
Traditional biomass for domestic heating and cooking still
accounts for more than 10% of global energy supplies but
could eventually be replaced, mainly by modern biomass and

support the deployment of carbon-emitting technologies,
especially in countries seeking supply security to provide
sustainable development paths, could have profound effects
on GHG emissions for the next several decades. Smaller-scale,
distributed energy plants using local energy resources and low-

be built more quickly and be efficient by utilizing both heat and

"Note: The IEA convention is to assume a 33% conversion efficiency when cal-
culating the primary energy equivalent of nuclear energy from gross generation.
The conversion efficiencies of a fossil fuel or nuclear power plant are typically
about 33% due to heat losses whereas the energy in stored water (and other
non-thermal means) is converted in turbines at efficiencies approaching 100%.
Thus, for a much lower energy equivalent, hydro can produce the same amount
of electricity as a thermal plant without a system to utilize the waste heat. 1000

financial markets commanding a higher interest rate to cover

relatively low fraction of generation costs compared with fossil-

"Many consumers of petroleum and, to a lesser degree, natural
gas depend to varying but significant amounts of fuels imported
from distant, often politically unstable regions of the world and
transported through a number of locations equally vulnerable to
disruptions. For example, in 2004 16.5-17 Mbbl/d of oil was
shipped through the Straits of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf and
11.7 Mbbl/d through the Straits of Malacca in Asia (EIA/DOE,
2005). A disruption in supply at either of these points could have
a severe impact on global oil markets. Political unrest in some
oil and gas producing regions of Middle East, Africa and Latin
America has also highlighted the vulnerability of supply. When
international trade in oil and gas expands in the near future, the
risks of supply disruption may increase leading to more serious
impacts (IEA, 2004b; CIEP, 2004). This is a current driver for
shifting to less vulnerable renewable energy resources.

"Whereas fossil fuel sources of around 100,000 W/m? land
area have been discovered at individual locations, extracted
and then distributed, renewable energy is usually widely
dispersed at densities of 1-5 W/m? and hence must either be
used in a distributed manner or concentrated to meet the high
energy demands of cities and industries. For renewable energy
systems, variations in climate may produce future uncertainties
result from dry years for hydro, poor crop yields for biomass,
increased cloud cover and materials costs for solar, and
variability in annual wind speeds. However, over their lifetime
they are relatively price-stable sources and in a mixed portfolio
of technologies can avoid losses from fluctuating oil, gas and
power prices (Awerbuch and Sauter, 2005) unless their owner
also has to sell based on volatile short-term prices (Roques et
al., 2006). World oil and gas prices in 2005 and 2006 were
significantly higher than most pre-2005 scenario models
predicted. This might lead to a reduction in transportation use
and GHG emissions (Chapter 5), but conversely could also
encourage a shift to coal-fired power plants. Hence, high energy
prices do not necessarily mean increased investments in low
carbon technologies or lower GHG emissions.

"If used in present reactor designs with a ‘once-through’ fuel
cycle, only a small percentage of the energy content is utilized
from the fissile isotope U-235 (0.7% in natural uranium).
Uranium reserves would last only a few hundred years at
current rate of consumption (Figure 4.10). With fast-spectrum
reactors operated in a ‘closed’ fuel cycle by reprocessing the
spent fuel and extracting the unused uranium and plutonium
produced, the reserves of natural uranium may be extended to
several thousand years at current consumption levels. In the
recycle option, fast-spectrum reactors utilize depleted uranium
and only plutonium is recycled so that the uranium-resource
efficiency is increased by a factor of 30 (Figure 4.10; OECD,
2001). Thereby the estimated enhanced resource availability
of total conventional uranium resources corresponds to about
220,000 EJ primary energy (Table 4.2). Even if the nuclear
industry expands significantly, sufficient fuel is available for
centuries. If advanced breeder reactors could be designed in
the future to efficiently utilize recycled or depleted uranium
and all actinides, then the resource utilization efficiency would
be further improved by an additional factor of eight (OECD,

most mature markets, several forms of ‘new’ renewable energy
can compete with conventional energy sources on an average-
cost basis, especially where environmental externalities and
fossil fuel price risks are taken into account. In countries where
market deployment is slow due to less than optimal resources,
higher costs (relative to conventional fuels) and/or a variety

Binary systems have become state-of-the-art technologies but

Estimates of current global installed peak capacity vary widely,

to more modest rates of 15—20% for off-grid PV. Expansion is
taking place at around 30% per year in developing countries
where around 20% of all new global PV capacity was installed
in 2004, mainly in rural areas where grid electricity is either not
available or unreliable (WEC, 2004c). Decentralized generation
by solar PV is already economically feasible for villages with

production grew from 740 MW in 2003 to 1700 MW in 2005,
with new manufacturing plant capacity built to meet growing
demand (Martinot et al., 2005). Japan is the world market
leader, producing over half the present annual production (IEA,

Most commercial hydrogen production today is based on steam
reforming of methane, but electrolysis of water (especially
using carbon-free electricity from renewable or nuclear energy)
or splitting water thermo-chemically may be viable approaches
in the future. Electrolysis may be favoured by development of
fuel cells that require a low level of impurities. Current costs of

"Cost estimates of the components of a CCS system vary
widely depending on the base case and the wide range of source,
transport and storage options (Table 4.5). In most systems,
the cost of capture (including compression) is the largest
component, but this could be reduced by 20-30% over the
next few decades using technologies still in the research phase
as well as by upscaling and learning from experience (IPCC,
2005). The extra energy required is a further cost consideration.
CO, storage is economically feasible under conditions specific
to enhanced oil recovery (EOR), and in saline formations,
avoiding carbon tax charges for offshore gas fields in Norway.
Pipeline transport of CO, operates as amature market technology
(IPCC, 2005), costing 1-5 US$/tCO, per 100 km (high end for
very large volumes) (IEA, 2006a). Several thousand kilometres
of pipelines already transport 40 Mt/yr of CO, to EOR projects.
The costs of transport and storage of CO, could decrease slowly
as technology matures further and the plant scale increases.

"Storage capacity in oil and gas fields, saline formations
and coal beds is uncertain. The IPCC (IPCC, 2005) reported
675 to 900 GtCO, for the relatively well-characterized gas
and oil fields, more than 1000 GtCO, (possibly up to an
order of magnitude higher) for saline formations, and up to
200 GtCO, for coal beds. Bradshaw et al. (2006) highlighted
the incomparability of localized storage-capacity data that use
different assumptions and methodologies. They also criticized
any top-down estimate of storage capacity not based on a
detailed site characterization and a clear methodology, and
emphasized the value of conservative estimates. In the literature,
however, specific estimates were based on top-down data and
varied beyond the range cited in the IPCC (2005). For instance,
a potential of >4000 GtCO, was reported for saline formations
in North America alone (Dooley et a/., 2005) and between 560
and 1170 GtCO, for injection in oil and gas fields (Plouchart et
al., 2006). Agreement on a common methodology for storage
capacity estimates on the country- and region-level is needed to
give a more reliable estimate of storage capacities.

"The trend towards DES is growing, especially for distributed
electricity generation (DG), in which local energy sources (often
renewable) are utilized or energy is carried as a fuel to a point at
or near the location of consumption where it is then converted to
electricity and distributed locally. As well as wind, geothermal
and biomass-fuelled technologies, DG systems can use a wide
range of fuels to run diesel generators, gas engines, small and
micro-turbines, and Stirling engines with power outputs down
to <1 kW, and widely varying power-heat output ratios between
1:3 and 1:36 (IEA, 2006a). The motive power of a vehicle to
supply electricity could be used. Hydrogen (Section 4.3.4.3),
could fuel modified internal combustion engines to provide a
near-term option, or fuel cells in the longer term (Gehl, 2004).

necessarily decreases the energy efficiency of the entire system

60% for pumped hydro to over 90% for flywheels and super-

vanadium redox batteries and capacitors are under evaluation
but have low energy density and high cost. Cost and durability

global electric power generation was supplied by decentralized
systems, having a total capacity of 281.9 GW,. Capacity of
DES expanded by 11.4% between 2002 and 2004, much of it as
combined heat and power (CHP) using natural gas or biomass
to combine electric power generation with the capture and
use of waste heat for space heating, industrial and residential
hot water, or for cooling. Growth in the USA, where capacity
stands at 80 GW.,, has been relatively slow because of regulatory
barriers and the rising price of natural gas. The European
market is expected to expand following the 2003 Cogeneration
Directive from the European Commission, while India has
added decentralized generation to enhance system reliability.
Brazil, Australia and elsewhere are adding CHP facilities that
use bagasse from their sugar and ethanol processing. Brazil has
the potential to generate 11% of its electricity from this source.
China is also adding small amounts of decentralized electric
power in some of its major cities (50 GW, in 2004), but central
power still dominates. Japan is promoting the use of natural
gas-fuelled CHP with a target of almost 5000 MW by 2010 to

"A summary of cost-estimate ranges for the specific
technologies as discussed in Section 4.3 is presented in Table 4.7.
Costs and technical potentials out to 2030 show that abundant
supplies of primary-energy resources will remain available.
Despite uncertainty due to the wide range of assumptions,
renewable energy fluxes and uranium resources are in sufficient
supply to meet global primary-energy demands well past 2030
(Table 4.7). Proven and probable fossil-fuel reserves are also
large, but concern over environmental impacts from combusting
them could drive a transition to non-carbon energy sources. The
speed of such a transition occurring depends, inter alia, on a
number of things: how quickly investment costs can be driven
down; confirmation that future life-cycle cost assessments for
nuclear power, CCS and renewables are realistic; true valuation
of externality costs and their inclusion in energy prices; and
what policies are established to improve energy security and
reduce GHG emissions (University of Chicago, 2004).

the recent IEA Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP) report

potentials are partly based on the TAR assessment? but use
more recent data and revised assumptions. Heat and CHP
potentials (Section 4.3.5) were difficult to assess as reliable data
are unavailable. For this reason the IEA aggregates commercial
heat with power (IEA, 2004a, 2005a, 2006b). An estimate of
the potential mitigation from increased CHP uptake by industry
by 2050 was 0.2-0.4 GtCO, (IEA, 2006a), but is uncertain so

"This analysis quantifies the mitigation potential at the
high end of the range for each technology by 2030 above the
baseline. It assumes each technology will be implemented as
much as economically and technically possible, but is limited
by the practical constraints of stock turnover, rate of increase of
manufacturing capacity, training of specialist expertise, etc. The
assumptions used are compared with other analyses reported
in the literature. Since, in reality, each technology will be
constrained by what will be happening elsewhere in the energy-
supply sector, they could never reach this total ‘maximum’
potential collectively, so these individual potentials cannot be
directly added together to obtain a projected ‘real’ potential.
Further analysis based on a possible future mix of generation
technologies is therefore provided in Section 4.4.4 and further
in Chapter 11, accounting for energy savings reducing the total
demand. Emission factors per GJ primary fuel for CO;, N,O
and CH, (IPCC, 1997) were used in the analysis but the non-
CO, gases accounted for less than 1% of emissions.

most relevant assumptions. The cost of fuel switching partly
depends on the difference between coal and gas prices. For
example if mitigation costs below 20 US$/tCO,-eq avoided,
this would imply a relatively small price gap between coal
and gas, although since fuel switching to a significant degree
would affect natural gas prices, actual future costs are difficult
to estimate with accuracy. Generation costs are assumed to be

"when used together with the more efficient combined-cycle
results in even higher efficiencies (IEA, 2006a). Emission
savings (gCO,-eq/kWh) were calculated before and after each
substitution option (based on IPCC 1996 emission factors). The
baseline scenario (IEA, 2004a) assumed a 5% CO, reduction
from fossil-fuel mix changes (coal to gas, oil to gas etc.) and a
further 7% reduction in the Alternative Policy scenario from fuel
switching in end uses (see Chapters 6 and 7). By 2030, natural
gas CCGT plants displacing coal, new advanced steam coal
plants displacing less-efficient designs, and the introduction of
new coal IGCC plants to replace traditional steam plants could
provide a potential between 0.5 and 1.4 GtCO, depending on
the timing and sequence of economics and policy measures
(IEA, 2006a). IEA analysis also showed that up to 50 GW
of stationary gas-fired fuel cells could be operating by 2030,
growing to around 3% of all power generation capacity by 2050
and giving about 0.5 Gt CO, emissions reduction (IEA, 2006)).
This potential is uncertain, however, as it relies on appropriate
fuel-cell development and is not included here.

The ETP (IEA, 2006a) stated the technical potential
of hydropower to be 14,000 TWh/yr, of which around
6000 TWh/yr (56 EJ) could be realistic to develop (IHA, 2006).
The WEO Alternative scenario (IEA, 2006b) assumed an
increased share for hydro generation above baseline, reaching
4903 TWh/yr by 20303. IEA (2006a) suggested hydropower
(both small and large) could offset fossil-fuel power plants
to give a mitigation potential between 0.3—1.0 GtCO,/yr by
2030. Here it is assumed that enough existing and new sites
will be available to contribute around 5500 TWh/yr (17% of
total electricity generation) by 2030 as a result of displacing
coal, gas and oil plants based on their current share of the base
load (Table 4.12). Future costs range from 30-70 US$/MWh

load demand, and with good all-year-round flow rates. Smaller

only small quantities of fossil fuels in the fuel cycle, net CO,

potential for nuclear power are uncertain and controversial.
The 2006 WEO Alternative scenario (IEA, 2006b) anticipated
a 50% increase in nuclear energy (to 4106 TWh/yr) by 2030.
The ETP report (IEA, 2006a) assumed a mitigation potential of
0.4-1.3 GtCO, by 2030 from the construction of Generation II,
Ill, I+ and IV nuclear plants (Section 4.3.2). From a review
of the literature and the various scenario projections described
above (for example Figure 4.25), it is assumed that by 2030
18% of total global power-generation capacity could come from
existing nuclear power plants as well as new plants displacing
proposed new coal, gas and oil plants in proportion to their
current share of the baseline (Table 4.11). The rate of build
required is possible (given the nuclear industry’s track record
for building reactors in the 1970s) and generating costs of

Policy scenario. However, wind industry ‘advanced’ scenarios
are more optimistic, forecasting up to a 29.1% share for wind
by 2030 with a mitigation potential of 3.1 GtCO,/yr (GWEC,

plants according to the relevant shares of coal, oil and gas in
the baseline for each region (Table 4.13). Intermittency issues
on most grids would not be limiting at these low levels given
suitable control and back-up systems in place. The costs are

"Heat and CHP estimates are wide ranging so cannot be
included in this analysis, even though the bioenergy potential
could be significant. However, any heat previously utilized from
displaced coal and gas CHP plants could easily be supplied from
biomass, with more biomass available for use in stand-alone
heat plants (Chapter 11). In this analysis, a 5% share in OECD
regions is assumed feasible, relying on co-firing in existing
and new coal plants and with 7-8% of the total replacement
capacity built being bioenergy plants. In EIT regions, the
available forest biomass could be utilized to gain 5% share
and in non-OECD regions, where there are less stock turnover
issues than in the OECD, 10% of power could come from new
bioenergy plants (Table 4.14). A total potential by 2030 of 5%
is assumed based on costs of 30-100 US$/MWh. The biomass
feedstock required to meet these potentials, assuming thermal-
conversion efficiencies of 20-30%, would be around 9-13 EJ
in OECD, 1-3 EJ in EIT, and 18-27 EJ in non-OECD regions.
Little additional bioenergy capacity above that already assumed
in the baseline is anticipated in EIT regions where only a small
contribution is expected compared with developing countries.
Small inputs of fossil fuels are often used to produce, transport
and convert the biomass (IEA, 2006h), but the same is true when
using the fossil fuels it replaces. Since both are of a similar
order of magnitude, and these emissions are already accounted
for in the overall total for fossil fuels, bioenergy is credited with
zero emissions (in compliance with IPCC guidelines).

storage potential for each region (Hendriks et al. 2004; Table
4.17) appears to be sufficient for storage over the next few
decades, although capacity assessments are still under debate
(IPCC, 2005). The proximity of a CCS plant to a storage site
affects the cost, but this level of analysis was not considered here.
CCS does not appear in the baseline (IEA, 2004a). Penetration
by 2030 is uncertain as it depends both on the carbon price and
the rate of technological advances in costs and performance.

"Concentrating solar power (CSP) and photovoltaics (PV)
can theoretically gain a maximum 1—2% share of the global
electricity mix by 2030 even at high costs. The 2006 WEO
Reference scenario (IEA, 2006b) estimated 142 TWh/yr of PV
generation in 2030 rising to 237 TWh in the Alternative scenario
but still at <1% of total generation. EPRI (2003) assessed total
PV capacity to be 205 GW by 2020 generating 282 TWh/yr or
about 1% of global electricity demand. Other analyses range
from over 20% of global electricity generation by 2040 (Jager-
Waldau, 2003) to 0.008% by 2030 with mitigation potential for
both PV and CSP likely to be <0.1 GtCO, in 2030 (IEA, 2006a)
The calculated minimum costs for even the best sites resulted
in relatively high costs per tonne CO, avoided (Table 4.16). The
baseline (IEA, 2004a) gave the total solar potential as 466 TWh
or 1.4% of total generation in 2030.

"New electricity generation plants to be built between 2010
and 2030 are to provide additional generating capacity to
meet the projected increase in power demand, and to replace
capacity of old, existing plants being retired during the same
period. Additional capacity built after 2010, consumes an
additional 82.5 EJ/yr of primary energy in order to generate
11,471 TWh/yr more electricity by 2030. Replacement capacity
built during the period consumes 72 EJ/yr in 2030 and generates
8074 TWh/yr. Therefore, the total generation from new plants

TWh/yr comes from fossil-fuel plants (75%), 3787 TWh/yr
from other renewables (19%), and 1140 TWh/yr from nuclear

"For each major world country-grouping (OECD Pacific,
US and Canada, OECD Europe, EIT, East Asia, South
Asia, China, Latin America, Mexico, Middle East and
Africa), WEO 2004 baseline data (Price and de la Rue du
Can, 2006; IEA, 2004a) are used to show the capacity of
fossil-fuel thermal electricity generation per year that could
be substituted after 2010, assuming a linear replacement
rate and a 50-year life for existing coal, gas and oil plants.
The results are then aggregated into OECD, EIT and non-
OECD/EIT regional groupings.

New generation plants built by 2030 to meet the increasing
power demand are shared between fossil fuel, renewables,
nuclear and, after 2015, coal and gas-fired plants with CCS.
The shares of total power generation assumed for each
of these technologies by 2030 are based on the literature
(Section 4.4.3), but also depend partly on their relative costs
(Table 4.19). The relatively high shares assumed for nuclear
and renewable energy, particularly in OECD countries,
are debatable, but supported to some extent by European
Commission projections (EC, 2007).

No early retirements of plant or stranded assets are
contemplated (although in reality a faster replacement rate
of existing fossil-fuel capacity could be possible given more
stringent policies in future to reduce GHG emissions). The
assumed replacement rates of old fossil-fuel plant capacity
by nuclear, and renewable electricity, and the uptake of CCS
technologies, are each based on the regional power mix
shares of coal, gas and oil plants operating in the baseline.
In reality, the future value of carbon will likely affect the
actual generation shares for each technology, as will any
mitigation policies in place before 2030 that encourage
reductions of GHG emissions from specific components of
the energy-supply sector.
"	List
"It is assumed that after 2010 only power plants with higher
conversion efficiencies (Table 4.20) are built.
As fuel switching from coal to natural gas supply is assessed
to be an option with relatively low costs, this is implemented
first with 20% of new proposed coal-fired power plants
substituted by gas-fired technologies in all regions (based
on Section 4.4.3.1).
It is assumed that, where cost-effective, some of the new
fossil-fuel plants required according to the baseline (after
adjustments for the previous step) are displaced by low-
and zero-carbon-intensive technologies (wind, geothermal,
hydro, bioenergy, solar, nuclear and CCS) in proportion
to their relative costs and potential deployment rates. The
resulting GHG emissions avoided are assessed.

Itis assumed that by 2030, wind, solar CSP and solar PV plants

that displace new and replacement fossil-fuel generation

are partly constrained by related environmental impact
issues, the relatively high costs for some renewable plants
compared to coal, gas and nuclear, and intermittency issues
in power grids. However, developments in energy-storage
technologies, supportive policy trends and recognition of
co-benefits are assumed to partly offset these constraints.

Priority grid access for renewables is also assumed. Thus,

reasonably high shares in the mix become feasible (Table

4.20).

The share of electricity generation from each technology

assumes that the maximum resource available is not

exceeded. The available energy resources are evaluated
on a regional basis to ensure all assumptions can be met in
principle.

— Any volumes of biomass needed above those available
from agricultural and forest residues (Chapters 8 and 9)
will need to be purpose-grown, so could be constrained
by land and water availability. While there is some
uncertainty in this respect, there should be sufficient
production possible in all regions to meet the generation
from bioenergy as projected in this analysis.

— Uranium fuel supplies for nuclear plants should meet
the assumed growth in demand, especially given the
anticipation of ‘Gen III’ plant designs with fuel recycling
coming on stream before 2030.

— There is sufficient storage capacity for sequestering the
estimated capture of CO, volumes in all regions given
the anticipated rate of growth of CCS over the next few
decades (Hendricks et al., 2004).

As more low- and zero-carbon technologies become

New renewable energy generation increases to 8481 TWh/yr

Renewable-energy generation increases to 10,673 TWh/yr

PV and CSP are more costly (Table 4.19) so they can only

Nuclear power share of total generation remains similar
since other technologies now compete.

CCS now becomes competitive and 2003 TWh/yr is

6.44 GtCO,-eq/yr below the baseline, although if only 70%
of the assumed shares of total power generation for all the

For costs < 20 US$/tCO,-eq avoided:

The baseline generation from fossil fuel-fired plants in 2030
of 22,602 TWh (including 14,618 TWh from new generation)
reduces by 22.5% to 17,525 TWh (including 9541 TWh of
new build generation) due to the increased uptake of low-
and zero-carbon technologies. This is a reduction from the
71% of total generation in the baseline to 55%.

Of this total, fuel switching from coal to gas results in
additional gas-fired plants generating 1,495 TWh/yr by
2030, mainly in non-OECD/EIT countries, and thereby
avoiding 0.67 GtCO,-eq/yr of emissions.

Renewable energy generation increases from the 2030
baseline of 6126 TWh/yr to 7904 TWh/yr (6122 TWh/yr from
new generation plus 2336 TWh/yr remaining in operation
from 2010). The share of generation increases from 19.4% in
2010 to 26.7% by 2030.

The nuclear power baseline of 2929 TWh/yr by 2030 (9.3%
of total generation) increases to 5673 TWh/yr (17.9% of
generation), of which 3882 TWh/yr is from newly built
plants.

Overall, GHG emissions are reduced by 3.95 GtCO,-eq
giving 25.0% lower emissions than in the baseline. Around
half of this potential occurs in non-OECD/EIT countries
with OECD countries providing most of the remainder.
Should just 70% of the individual power-generation shares
assumed above for all the mitigation technologies be
achieved by 2030, the mitigation potential would reduce to
1.69 GtCO,-eq.

This range is in reasonable agreement with the TAR
analysis potential of 1.3 to 2.5 GtCO,-eq/yr for less than
27 US$/tCO,-eq avoided (IPCC, 2001), because this
potential was only out to 2020, the baseline has since been
adjusted, and since the TAR was published there has been
increased acceptance for improved designs of nuclear power
plants, an increase in development and deployment of
renewable energy technologies and a better understanding
of CCS technologies.

Setting goals and quantitative targets for low-carbon energy at
both national and regional levels increases the size of the markets
and provides greater policy stability for project developers. For
example, EU-15 members agreed on targets to increase their
share of renewable primary energy to 12% of total energy by
2010 including electricity to 22% and biofuels to 5.75% (EU,
2001; EU 2003). The Latin American and Caribbean Initiative,
signed in May 2002 included a target of 10% renewable energy
by 2010 (Goldemberg, 2004). The South African Government
mandated an additional 10 TWh renewable energy contribution
by 2013 (being 4% of final energy consumption) to the existing
contribution of 115 TWh/yr mainly from fuel wood and waste
(DME, 2003). Many other countries outlined similar targets at

emissions will be reduced below business as usual.

In recent years, domestic and international tradable emission
permit systems have received recognition as a means of lowering
the costs of meeting climate-change targets. Creating carbon
markets can help economies identify and realize economic ways
to reduce GHG emissions and other energy-related pollutants,
or to improve efficiency of energy use. The cost of achieving
the Kyoto Protocol targets in OECD regions could fall from
0.2% of GDP without trading to 0.1% (Newman et al., 2002)
as a result of introducing emission trading in an international
regime. Emission trading, such as the European and CDM
schemes, is designed to result in immediate GHG reductions, but
CDM also has long-term aspects, since the projects must assist
developing countries in achieving sustainable development (see
Chapter 13). The CDM successfully registered 450 projects by

costs (Menanteau et al., 2003). Quota-obligation systems are
only beginning to have an effect on capacity additions, in part
because they are still new. However, about 75% of the wind
capacity installed in the US between 1998 and 2004 occurred
in states with renewable energy standards. Experience shows

The need for further investments in R&D of all low-carbon-
emission technologies, tied with the efficient marketing
of these products, is vital to climate policy. Programmes
supporting ‘clean technology’ development and diffusion are a
traditional focus of energy and environmental policies because
energy innovations face barriers all along the energy-supply
chain (from R&D, to demonstration projects, to widespread
deployment). Direct government support is often necessary to
hasten deployment of radically new technologies due to a lack
of industry investment. This suggests that there is a role for the
public sector in increasing investment directly and in correcting
market and regulatory obstacles that inhibit investment in new
technology through a variety of fiscal instruments such as tax
deduction incentives (Energy Policy Act, 2005; Jaffe et al,
2005).

Education, technical training and public awareness are
essential complements to GHG mitigation policies. They provide
direct and continuous incentives to think, act and buy ‘green’
energy and to use energy wisely. Green power schemes, where
consumers may choose to pay more for electricity generated
primarily from renewable energy sources, are an example of
combining information with real choice for the consumer
(Newman et al., 2002). Voluntary energy and emissions savings
programmes, such as Energy Star (EPA, 2005a), Gas Star (EPA,
2005b) and Coalbed Methane Outreach (EPA, 2005c) serve
to effectively disseminate relevant information and reduce
knowledge barriers to the efficient and clean use of energy.
These programmes include public education aspects, but are
also built on industry/government partnerships. However,
uncertainties on the effectiveness of information instruments for
climate-change mitigation remain. More sociological research
would improve the knowledge on adequacy of information
instruments (Chapter 13).

"Air-quality legislation needs to be approached using the
principles of integrated pollution prevention and control if
unexpected and unwanted climate impacts on a global scale are
to be avoided (Nalbandian, 2002). Adopting a multi-parameter
approach could be useful. A US proposal calls for a cap and
trade scheme for the power sector, simultaneously covering
SO;, NO,, mercury and CO;, which would specifically avoid
conflicts with conventional regulations. Facilities would be
required to optimize control strategies across all four pollutants
(Burtraw and Toman, 2000). An approach developed for Mexico
City showed that linear programming, applied to a database
comprising emission-reduction information derived separately
for air pollutants and GHGs, could provide a useful decision
support tool to analyse least-cost strategies for meeting co-
control targets for multiple pollutants (West et al., 2004).

precluded due to stringent limits being set for ambient SO,
concentrations mandate, then the alternative of SO, scrubbers or
other end-of-pipe removal equipment will require energy for its
operation and thus divert it away from the production process.
This leads to an overall decrease in cycle efficiency with a
concomitant increase in CO, emissions. Sorbent extraction or
other processes necessary to support scrubber operations also
have GHG emissions associated with them. This effectively
amounts to trading off a potential local or regional acid rain
problem against a larger global climate problem. The overall
costs of damage due to unmitigated CO, emissions have been
estimated to greatly exceed those from regional acidification
impacts arising from insufficient control of SO, emissions

"Mitigation policies relating to energy efficiency of plants,
fuel switching, renewable energy uptake and nuclear power,
may have several objectives that imply a diverse range of
co-benefits. These include the mitigation of air-pollution
impacts, energy-supply security (by increased energy diversity),
technological innovation, reduced fuel cost, employment and
reducing urban migration. Reducing GHG emissions in the
energy sector yields a global impact, but the co-benefits are
typically experienced on a local or regional level. The variety
of co-benefits stemming from GHG mitigation policies and
the utilization of new energy technologies can be an integral
part of economic policies that strive to facilitate sustainable
development. These include improved health, employment
and industrial development, and are explored in Chapter 11.

"The reduced costs of new technologies due to experience,
and the incentives for further improvement due to competition,
can be co-benefits of climate-change policies (Jochem and
Madlener, 2002). New energy technologies are typically more
expensive during their market-introduction phase but substantial
learning experience can usually be achieved to reduce costs
and enhance skill levels (Barreto, 2001; Herzog et al., 2001;
IEA, 2000; McDonald and Schrattenholzer, 2001; NCOE,
2004). Increased net employment and trade of technologies
and services are useful co-benefits given high unemployment
in many countries. Employment is created at different levels,
from research and manufacturing to distribution, installation
and maintenance. Renewable-energy technologies are more
labour-intensive than conventional technologies for the same
energy output (Kamman et al., 2004). For example, solar PV
generates 5.65 person-years of employment per | million US$
investment (over ten years) and the wind-energy industry 5.7

"Co-benefits of mitigation can be important decision criteria
in analyses by policymakers, but often neglected (Jochem
and Madlener, 2002). There are many cases where the net
co-benefits are not monetised, quantified or even identified
by decision-makers and businesses. Due consideration of
co-benefits can significantly influence policy decisions
concerning the level and timing of GHG mitigation action.
There may be significant economic advantages to the national
stimulation of technical innovation and possible spillover
effects, with developing countries benefiting from innovation
stimulated by GHG mitigation in industrialized countries. Most
aspects of co-benefits have short-term effects, but they support
long-term mitigation policies by creating a central link to
sustainable development objectives (Kessels and Bakker, 2005).
To date, most analyses have calculated GHG mitigation costs
by dividing the incremental costs of ‘mitigation technologies’
by the amount of GHG avoided. This implicitly attributes all
the costs to GHG-emission reduction and the co-benefits are
seen as ancillary. Ideally, one would attribute the incremental
costs to the various co-benefits by attempting to weight them.
This could lead to significantly lower costs of GHG reductions
since the other co-benefits would carry a share of the costs
together with a change in the cost ranking of mitigation options
(Schlamadinger et al. 2006).

"The advent of reform in the energy sector increases

upwards after commencement of reforms (Wamukonya, 2003;
Dubash, 2003) making electricity even more inaccessible to the
lower-income earners. There are many genuine efforts to address
such issues (World Bank, 2005), although much still needs to
be done (Lort-Phillips and Herringshaw, 2006). Companies
whose origin countries have stringent mandatory disclosure

Public private partnerships in developing countries are starting
to make inroads into the issue of inequity and to harmonize

such example is the Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership

that recent times have seen major improvements. For instance,
whereas epidemiological studies have shown that oil production

risks due to application of effective abatement technology, a
Kazakhstan study compared the health costs between the city
of Atyrau (with a high rate of pollution from oil extraction)
and Astana (without). Health costs per household in Atyrau
were twice as high as in Astana. The study also showed that
the annual benefits of investments in abatement technologies
were at least five times higher than the virtual annual abatement

"Population growth and higher per-capita energy demand
are forcing the transition of supply patterns from potentially
sustainable systems to unsustainable ones. Efficient use of
biomass can reduce CO, emissions, but can only be sustained
if supplies are adequate to satisfy demand without depleting
carbon stocks by deforestation (Section 4.3.3.3). If supplies
are inadequate, it may be necessary to shift demand to fossil
fuels to prevent overharvesting. In Niger, for example, despite
the concerted efforts through a long-term World Bank funded
project, it is not possible to provide sufficient woody biomass on
a sustainable basis. As a result, the government has launched a

from wood to coal and has re-launched a 3000 t/yr production

When assessing mitigation options it is important to consider
their lifecycle GHG impacts. This is especially true for choices
among alternative fuels but also applies to a lesser degree to
the manufacturing processes and materials composition of
advanced technologies. Electricity and hydrogen can offer
the opportunity to ‘de-carbonise’ the transport energy system
although the actual full cycle carbon reduction depends upon
the way electricity and hydrogen are produced. Assessment
of mitigation potential in the transport sector through the year
2030 is uncertain because the potential depends on:

"Improving energy efficiency offers an excellent opportunity
for transport GHG mitigation through 2030. Carbon emissions
from ‘new’ light-duty road vehicles could be reduced by up
to 50% by 2030 compared to currently produced models,
assuming continued technological advances and _ strong
policies to ensure that technologies are applied to increasing
fuel economy rather than spent on increased horsepower and
vehicle mass. Material substitution and advanced design could
reduce the weight of light-duty vehicles by 20-30%. Since the
TAR (Third Assessment Report), energy efficiency of road
vehicles has improved by the market success of cleaner direct-

"In 2004, the transport sector produced 6.3 GtCO, emissions

is highest among the end-user sectors. Road transport currently
accounts for 74% of total transport CO, emissions. The share
of non-OECD countries is 36% now and will increase rapidly
to 46% by 2030 if current trends continue (high agreement,

amounts of CH, and N,O emissions from fuel combustion
and F-gases (fluorinated gases) from vehicle air conditioning.
CH, emissions are between 0.1—0.3% of total transport GHG

improvements in light-duty vehicles and aircraft and does
not cover the potential for heavy-duty vehicles, rail transport,

Urbanization has been extremely rapid in the past century.
About 75% of people in the industrialized world and 40% in
the developing world now live in urban areas. Also, cities have
grown larger, with 19 cities now having a population over 10
million. A parallel trend has been the decentralization of cities —
they have spread out faster than they have grown in population,
with rapid growth in suburban areas and the rise of ‘edge cities’
in the outer suburbs. This decentralization has created both
a growing demand for travel and an urban pattern that is not
easily served by public transport. The result has been a rapid
increase in personal vehicles — not only cars but also 2-wheelers
— and a declining share of transit. Further, the lower-density
development and the greater distances needed to access jobs
and services have seen the decline of walking and bicycling as
a share of total travel (WBCSD, 2002).

"GHG emission reduction will be only one of several key
issues in transport during the coming decades and will not
be the foremost issue in many areas. In developing countries
especially, increasing demand for private vehicles is outpacing
the supply of transport infrastructure — including both road
networks and public transit networks. The result is growing
congestion and air pollution, and a rise in traffic fatalities.
Further, the predominant reliance on private vehicles for
passenger travel is creating substantial societal strains as
economically disadvantaged populations are left out of the rapid
growth in mobility. In many countries, concerns about transport
will likely focus on the local traffic, pollution, safety and equity
effects. The global warming issue in transport will have to be
addressed in the context of the broader goal of sustainable
development.

"Worldwide travel studies have shown that the average
time budget for travel is roughly constant worldwide, with
the relative speed of travel determining distances travelled
yearly (Schafer, 2000). As incomes have risen, travellers have
shifted to faster — and more energy-intensive — modes, from
walking and bicycling to public transport to automobiles and,
for longer trips, to aircraft. And as income and travel have
risen, the percentage of trips made by automobiles has risen.
Automobile travel now accounts for 15—30% of total trips in the
developing world, but 50% in Western Europe and 90% in the
United States. The world auto fleet has grown with exceptional
rapidity — between 1950 and 1997, the fleet increased from
about 50 million vehicles to 580 million vehicles, five times
faster than the growth in population. In China, for example,

farms, schools and clinics is not unusual in rural areas of the
developing world, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, but also in
parts of Asia and Latin America. Commuting by public transport
is very costly for the urban poor, taking, for example, 14% of
the income of the poor in Manila compared with 7% of the
income of the non-poor (World Bank, 1996). If and when these
areas develop and their population’s incomes rise, the prospects
for a vast expansion of motorization and increase in fossil fuel
use and GHG emissions is very real. And these prospects are
exacerbated by the evidence that the most attractive form of
transport for most people as their incomes rise is the motorized
personal vehicle, which is seen as a status symbol as well
as being faster, flexible, convenient and more comfortable
than public transport. Further aggravating the energy and
environmental concerns of the expansion of motorization is the
large-scale importation of used vehicles into the developing
world. Although increased access to activities and services will
contribute greatly to living standards, a critical goal will be to
improve access while reducing the adverse consequences of
motorization, including GHG emissions.

considerations than passenger travel because of pressure on
shippers to cut costs, however this can be offset by pressure
to increase speeds and reliability and provide smaller ‘just-in-

efficiency of specific modes has been increasing, there has been
an ongoing movement to the faster and more energy-intensive
modes. Consequently, rail and domestic waterways’ shares of
total freight movement have been declining, while highway’s
share has been increasing and air freight, though it remains a
small share, has been growing rapidly. Some breakdowns:

industrialized world (EC, 2005; Japanese Statistical Bureau,

emerging economies, are increasing their role elsewhere,

minibus jitneys run by private operators — has been rapidly
taking market share from the formal public-sector bus systems
in many areas, now accounting for 35% of trips in South Africa,
40% in Caracas and Bogota and up to 65% in Manila and other

"e National or continental freight is carried by a combination
of large trucks on higher speed roads, rail and ship.

e International freight is dominated by ocean shipping. The
bulk of international freight is carried aboard extremely
large ships carrying bulk dry cargo (e.g., iron ore), container
freight or fuel and chemicals (tankers).

e There is considerable variation in freight transport around
the world, depending on geography, available infrastructure
and economic development. The United States’ freight
transport system, which has the highest total traffic in the
world, is one in which all modes participate substantially.
Russia’s freight system, in contrast, is dominated by rail and
pipelines, whereas Europe’s freight systems are dominated
by trucking with a market share of 72% (tkm) in EU-25
countries, while rail’s market share is just 16.4% despite its
extensive network.? China’s freight system uses rail as its
largest carrier, with substantial contributions from trucks

"Global estimates of direct GHG emissions of the transport
sector are based on fuel use. The contribution of transport to
total GHG emissions was about 23%, with emissions of CO,
and N,O amounting to about 6300-6400 MtCO,-eq in 2004.
Transport sector CO, emissions have increased by around 27%
since 1990 (IEA, 2006d). For sub-sectors such as aviation and
marine transport, estimates based on more detailed information
are available. Estimates of global aviation CO, emissions using
a consistent inventory methodology have recently been made by
Lee et al. (2005). These showed an increase by approximately
a factor of 1.5 from 331 MtCO,/yr in 1990 to 480 MtCO,/yr in
2000. For seagoing shipping, fuel usage has previously been
derived from energy statistics (e.g., Olivier et al., 1996; Corbett
et al., 1999; Endresen et al., 2003). More recently, efforts have
been committed to constructing inventories using activity-
based statistics on shipping movements (Corbett and Kohler,
2003; Eyring et al., 2005a). This has resulted in a substantial
discrepancy. Estimated CO, emissions vary accordingly. This
has prompted debate over inventory methodologies in the
literature (Endresen et al., 2004; Corbett and Kéhler, 2004). It is
noteworthy that the NO, emissions estimates also vary strongly
between the different studies (Eyring ef al., 200Sa).

CO, emissions. Also, air-conditioning uses significant quantities of energy, with consequent CO, emissions from the fuel

"Individual sectors have not been studied in great detail, with the exception of aviation. Whilst surface vehicular transport
has a large fraction of global emissions of CO,, its radiative forcing (RF) impact is little studied. Vehicle emissions of NO,,
VOCs and CO contribute to the formation of tropospheric Oz, a powerful GHG; moreover, black carbon and organic carbon
may affect RF from this sector. Shipping has a variety of associated emissions, similar in many respects to surface vehicular
transport. One of shipping’s particular features is the observed formation of low-level clouds (‘ship-tracks’), which has a
negative RF effect. The potential coverage of these clouds and its associated RF is poorly studied, but one study estimates a
negative forcing of 0.110 W/m? (Capaldo et al., 1999), which is potentially much larger than its positive forcing from CO, and
it is possible that the overall forcing from shipping may be negative, although this requires more study. However, a distinction
should be drawn between RF and an actual climate effect in terms of global temperature change or sea-level rise; the latter
being much more complicated to estimate.
"	Text
"Aviation has a larger impact on radiative forcing than that from its CO, forcing alone. This was estimated for 1992 and a range
of 2050 scenarios by IPCC (1999) and updated for 2000 by Sausen et a/. (2005) using more recent scientific knowledge and
data. Aviation emissions impact radiative forcing in positive (warming) and negative (cooling) ways as follows: CO, (+25.3
mW/mz?); O3 production from NO, emissions (+21.9 mW/m2); ambient CH, reduction as a result of NO, emissions (-10.4 mW/
m2); HO (+2.0 mW/m?); sulphate particles (-3.5 mW/m/?); soot particles (+2.5 mW/m?); contrails (+10.0 mW/m2); cirrus cloud
enhancement (10-80 mW/m2). These effects result in a total aviation radiative forcing for 2000 of 47.8 mW/m2, excluding
cirrus cloud enhancement, for which no best estimate could be made, as was the case for IPCC (1999). Forster et al. (2007)
assumed that aviation radiative forcing (0.048 W/m? in 2000, which excludes cirrus) to have grown by no more that 10%
between 2000 and 2005. Forster et al. (2007) estimate a total net anthropogenic radiative forcing in 2005 of 1.6 W/m? (range
0.6-2.4 W/m?). Aviation therefore accounts for around 3% of the anthropogenic radiative forcing in 2005 (range 2-8%). This
90% confidence range is skewed towards lower percentages and does not account for uncertainty in the aviation forcings.

that the emerging economies’ share of world transport energy

"The three forecasts all assume that world oil supplies will be
sufficient to accommodate the large projected increases in oil
demand, and that world economies continue to grow without
significant disruptions. With this caveat, all three forecast robust
growth in world transport energy use over the next few decades,
at a rate of around 2% per year. This means that transport
energy use in 2030 will be about 80% higher than in 2002 (see
Figure 5.3). Almost all of this new consumption is expected to
be in petroleum fuels, which the forecasts project will remain
between 93% and slightly over 95% of transport fuel use over
the period. As a result, CO, emissions will essentially grow in
lockstep with energy consumption (see Figure 5.4).

"Another important conclusion is that there will be a
significant regional shift in transport energy consumption, with
the emerging economies gaining significantly in share (Figure

IEA, projects a robust 3.6% per year growth rate for these
economies, while the IEA’s more recent WEO 2006 projects
transport demand growth of 3.2%. In China, the number of cars
has been growing at a rate of 20% per year, and personal travel
has increased by a factor of five over the past 20 years. At its
projected 6% rate of growth, China’s transport energy use would
nearly quadruple between 2002 and 2025, from 4.3 EJ in 2002

"In contrast, transport energy use in the mature market
economies is projected to grow more slowly. EIA forecasts
1.2% per year and IEA forecasts 1.3% per year for the OECD
nations. EIA projects transport energy in the United States to
grow at 1.7% per year, with moderate population and travel
growth and only modest improvement in efficiency. Western
Europe’s transport energy is projected to grow at a much slower
0.4% per year, because of slower population growth, high fuel
taxes and significant improvements in efficiency. IEA projects
a considerably higher 1.4% per year for OECD Europe. Japan,
with an aging population, high taxes and low birth rates, is
projected to grow at only 0.2% per year. These rates would lead
to 2002-2025 increases of 46%, 10% and 5%, for the USA,
Western Europe and Japan, respectively. These economies’

"The loads on the vehicle consist of the force needed to
accelerate the vehicle, to overcome inertia; vehicle weight when
climbing slopes; the rolling resistance of the tyres; aerodynamic
forces; and accessory loads. In urban stop-and-go driving,
aerodynamic forces play little role, but rolling resistance and
especially inertial forces are critical. In steady highway driving,
aerodynamic forces dominate, because these forces increase
with the square of velocity; aerodynamic forces at 90 km/h!°
are four times the forces at 45 km/h. Reducing inertial loads
is accomplished by reducing vehicle weight, with improved
design and greater use of lightweight materials. Reducing tyre
losses is accomplished by improving tyre design and materials,
to reduce the tyres’ rolling resistance coefficient, as well as
by maintaining proper tyre pressure; weight reduction also
contributes, because tyre losses are a linear function of vehicle
weight. And reducing aerodynamic forces is accomplished by
changing the shape of the vehicle, smoothing vehicle surfaces,
reducing the vehicle’s cross-section, controlling airflow under
the vehicle and other measures. Measures to reduce the heating
and cooling needs of the passengers, for example by changing
window glass to reflect incoming solar radiation, are included
in the group of measures.

A 10% weight reduction from a total vehicle weight can
improve fuel economy by 4-8%, depending on changes in
vehicle size and whether or not the engine is downsized. There
are several ways to reduce vehicle weight; including switching

such as Al, Mg and plastics, evolution of lighter design concepts
and forming technologies. The amount of lighter materials in
vehicles has been progressively increasing over time, although
not always resulting in weight reductions and better fuel

the vehicle. In fact, the average weight of a vehicle in the USA

"The use of different liquid fuels, in blends with gasoline and
diesel or as ‘neat fuels’ require minimal or no changes to the
vehicle, while a variety of gaseous fuels and electricity would
require major changes. Alternative liquid fuels include ethanol,
biodiesel and methanol, and synthetic gasoline and diesel
made from natural gas, coal, or other feedstocks. Gaseous
fuels include natural gas, propane, dimethyl ether (a diesel
substitute) and hydrogen. Each fuel can be made from multiple
sources, with a wide range of GHG emission consequences.
In evaluating the effects of different fuels on GHG emissions,
it is crucial to consider GHG emissions associated with fuel
production and distribution in addition to vehicle tailpipe
emissions (see the section on well-to-wheels analysis). For
example, the consumption of hydrogen produces no emissions
aside from water directly from the vehicle, but GHG emissions
from hydrogen production can be quite high if the hydrogen is
produced from fossil fuels (unless the carbon dioxide from the
hydrogen production is sequestered).

"The use of plastics in vehicles has increased to about 8%
of total vehicle weight, which corresponds to 100-120 kg per

recycling, given that most of the plastic goes to the automobile
shredder residue (ASR) at the end of vehicle life. Fibre-
reinforced plastic (FRP) is now widely used in aviation, but its
application to automobiles is limited due to its high cost and
long processing time. However, its weight reduction potential is
very high, maybe as much as 60%. Examples of FRP structures
manufactured using RTM (resin transfer method) technology
are wheel housings or entire floor assemblies. For a compact-
size car, this would make it possible to reduce the weight; of a
floor assembly (including wheel housings) by 60%, or 22 kg per
car compared to a steel floor assembly. Research examples of
plastics use in the chassis are leaf or coil springs manufactured

performance of vehicles over the past decade, but substantial
additional improvements are possible. Improvement in
aerodynamic performance offers important gains for vehicles
operating at higher speeds, e.g., long-distance trucks and light-

example a 10% reduction in the coefficient of drag (Cp) of
a medium sized passenger car would yield only about a 1%
reduction in average vehicle forces on the US city cycle (with
31.4 km/h average speed), whereas the same drag reduction
on the US highway cycle, with average speed of 77.2 km/h,
would yield about a 4% reduction in average forces.!3 These
reductions in vehicle forces translate reasonably well into similar

both light-duty vehicles and freight trucks, there are remaining
concerns about the gap between tested emissions and on-

emissions testing uses test cycles that are considerably gentler
than seen in actual driving, allowing manufacturers to design
drive trains so that they pass emissions tests but ‘achieve better
fuel efficiency or other performance enhancement at the cost of
higher emissions during operation on the road (ECMT, 2006).”
Other concerns involve excessive threshold limits demanded of
onboard diagnostics systems, aftermarket mechanical changes

Similar concerns in the USA led to the phase-in between 2000

light-duty vehicles. The use of FFVs facilitates the introduction of new fuels. The incremental vehicle cost is small, about
100 US$.
"	Text
"In the USA?1, the number of FFVs is close to 6 million and some US manufacturers are planning to expand their sales.
However, unlike in the Brazilian experience, ethanol has not been widely available at fuel stations (other than as a 10% blend)
and thus the vehicles rarely fuel with ethanol. Their popularity in the USA is due to special fuel economy credits available to

the manufacturer.
"	Text
"The FFVs were developed with systems that allow the use of one or more liquid fuels, stored in the same tank. This system is
applied to OTTO cycle engines and enables the vehicles to run on gasoline, ethanol or both in a mixture, according to the fuel
availability. The combustion control is done through an electronic device, which identifies the fuel being used and then the
engine control system makes the suitable adjustments allowing the running of the engine in the most adequate condition.

"Biodiesel is less promising in terms of cost and production
potential than cellulosic fuels but is receiving increasing
attention. Bioesters are produced by a chemical reaction
between vegetable or animal oil and alcohol, such as ethanol
or methanol. Their properties are similar to those of diesel oil,
allowing blending of bioesters with diesel or the use of 100%
bioesters in diesel engines, and they are all called biodiesel.
Blends of 20% biodiesel with 80% petroleum diesel (B20) can
generally be used in unmodified diesel engines.

"These investments are beginning to be made. In 2006 BP
announced it was committing 1 billion US$ to develop new
biofuels, with special emphasis on bio-butanol, a liquid that can
be easily blended with gasoline. Other large energy companies
were also starting to invest substantial sums in biofuels R&D
in 2006, along with the US Department of Energy, to increase
plant yields, develop plants that are better matched with
process conversion technologies and to improve the conversion
processes. The energy companies in particular are seeking
biofuels other than ethanol that would be more compatible with
the existing petroleum distribution system.22

"For the future, the conversion of ligno-cellulosic sources
into biofuels is the most attractive biomass option. Ligno-
cellulosic sources are grasses and woody material. These
include crop residues, such as wheat and rice straw, and corn
stalks and leaves, as well as dedicated energy crops. Cellulosic
crops are attractive because they have much higher yields per
hectare than sugar and starch crops, they may be grown in areas
unsuitable for grains and other food/feed crops and thus do not
compete with food, and the energy use is far less, resulting in
much greater GHG reductions than with corn and most food

"Only in Brazil is biofuel competitive with oil at 50 US$ per

biofuel production costs are expected to drop considerably,
especially with cellulosic feedstocks. But even if the processing
costs are reduced, the scale issue is problematic. These facilities
have large economies of scale. However, there are large
diseconomies of scale in feedstock production (Sperling, 1985).
The cost of transporting bulky feedstock materials to a central
point increases exponentially, and it is difficult assembling large
amount of contiguous land to serve single large processing
facilities.
"	Text
"A large drawback of biodiesel fuels is the very high cost of
feedstocks. If waste oils are used the cost can be competitive,
but the quantity of waste oils is miniscule compared to transport
energy consumption. If crops are used, the feedstock costs are
generally far higher than for sugar, starch or cellulosic materials.
These costs are unlikely to drop since they are the same highly
developed crops used for foods and food processing. Indeed,
if diverted to energy use, the oil feedstock costs are likely
to increase still further, creating a direct conflict with food
production. The least expensive oil feedstock at present is palm
oil. Research is ongoing into new ways of producing oils. The
promising feedstock seems to be algae, but cost and scale issues
are still uncertain.

During the last decade, fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) have attracted
growing attention and have made significant technological
progress. Drivers for development of FCVs are global warming
(FCVs fuelled by hydrogen have zero CO, emission and high
efficiency), air quality (zero tailpipe emissions), and energy
security (hydrogen will be produced from a wide range of

"DME can be made from natural gas, but it can also be
produced by gasifying biomass, coal or even waste. It can be
stored in liquid form at 5—10 bar pressure at normal temperature.
This pressure is considerably lower than that required to store
natural gas on board vehicles (200 bar). A major advantage of
DME is its high cetane rating, which means that self-ignition
will be easier. The high cetane rating makes DME suitable for
use in efficient diesel engines.

"CNG has been popular in polluted cities because of its good
emission characteristics. However, in modern vehicles with
exhaust gas after-treatment devices, the non-CO, emissions
from gasoline engines are similar to CNG, and consequently
CNG loses its emission advantages in term of local pollutants;
however it produces less CO. Important constraints on its use
are the need for a separate refuelling infrastructure system
and higher vehicle costs — because CNG is stored under high
pressure in larger and heavier fuel tanks.
"	Text
"CNG and LNG combustion characteristics are appropriate
for spark ignition engines. Their high octane rating, about
120, allows a higher compression ratio than is possible using
gasoline, which can increase engine efficiency. This requires
that the vehicle be dedicated to CNG or LNG, however. Many
current vehicles using CNG are converted from gasoline
vehicles or manufactured as bifuel vehicles, with two fuel
tanks. Bifuel vehicles cannot take full advantage of CNG’s high
octane ratio.

if conventional oil production cannot keep up with growing
demand, but the current processes are relatively inefficient:

"There are several types of FCVs; direct-drive and hybrid
power train architectures fuelled by pure hydrogen, methanol

have advantages in terms of fuel storage and infrastructure, but
they need on-board fuel reformers (fuel processors), which leads
to lower vehicle efficiency (30-50% loss), longer start-up time,
slower response and higher cost. Because of these disadvantages
and rapid progress on direct hydrogen systems, nearly all auto
manufacturers are now focused on the pure hydrogen FCV.
Significant technological progress has been made since TAR
including: improved fuel cell durability, cold start (sub-freezing)
operation, increased range of operation, and dramatically reduced
costs (although FCV drive train costs remain at least an order of
magnitude greater than internal combustion engine (ICE) drive

In addition to reducing transport emissions, public transport
is considered favourably from a socially sustainable point of
view because it gives higher mobility to people who do not
have access to car. It is also attractive from an economically
sustainable perspective since public transport provides more
capacity at less marginal cost. It is less expensive to provide
additional capacity by expanding bus service than building new
roads or bridges. The expansion of public transport in the form
of large capacity buses, light rail transit and metro or suburban
rail can be feasible mitigation options for the transport sector.

"The development of new rail services can be an effective
measure for diverting car users to carbon-efficient mode
while providing existing public transport users with upgraded
service. However, a major hurdle is higher capital and possibly
operating cost of the project. Rail is attractive and effective
at generating high ridership in very dense cities. During the
1990s, less capital-intensive public transport projects such as
light rail transit (LRT) were planned and constructed in Europe,
North America and Japan. The LRT systems were successful in
some regions, including a number of French cities where land
use and transport planning is often well integrated (Hylen and
Pharoah, 2002), but less so in other cities especially in the USA
(Richmond, 2001; Mackett and Edwards, 1998), where more

"BRT is ‘a mass transit system using exclusive right of way
lanes that mimic the rapidity and performance of metro systems,
but utilizes bus technology rather than rail vehicle technology’
(Wright, 2004). BRT systems can be seen as enhanced bus service
and an intermediate mode between conventional bus service
and heavy rail systems. BRT includes features such as exclusive
right of way lanes, rapid boarding and alighting, free transfers
between routes and preboard fare collection and fare verification,
as well as enclosed stations that are safe and comfortable, clear
route maps, signage and real-time information displays, modal
integration at stations and terminals, clean vehicle technologies
and excellence in marketing and customer service. To be most
effective, BRT systems (like other transport initiatives) should
be part of a comprehensive strategy that includes increasing
vehicle and fuel taxes, strict land-use controls, limits and higher
fees on parking, and integrating transit systems into a broader
package of mobility for all types of travellers (IEA, 2002b).

The prospect for the reduction in CO, emissions by
switching from cars to non-motorized transport (NMT) such as
walking and cycling is dependent on local conditions. In the
Netherlands, where 47% of trips are made by NMT, the NMT
plays a substantial role up to distances of 7.5 km and walking
up to 2.5 km (Rietveld, 2001). As more than 30% of trips made
in cars in Europe cover distances of less than 3 km and 50% are
less than 5 km (EC, 1999), NMT can possibly reduce car use
in terms of trips and, to a lesser extent, in terms of kilometres.
While the trend has been away from NMT, there is considerable
potential to revive interest in NMT. In the Netherlands, with
strong policies and cultural commitment, the modal share of
bicycle and walking for accessing trains from home is about 35

Engine developments require a balancing of the emissions
produced to both satisfy operational need (fuel efficiency) and
regulatory need (NO,, CO, smoke and HC). This emissions
performance balance must also reflect the need to deliver
safety, reliability, cost and noise performance for the industry.
Developments that reduce weight, reduce aerodynamic drag
or improve the operation of the aircraft can offer all-round
benefits. Emissions — and noise — regulatory compliance
hinders the quest for improved fuel efficiency, and is often
most difficult for those engines having the highest pressure
ratios (PR). Higher PRs increase the temperature of the air
used for combustion in the engine, exacerbating the NO,
emissions challenge. Increasing an engine’s pressure ratio is
one of the options engine manufacturers use to improve engine
efficiency. Higher pressure ratios are likely to be a continuing
trend in engine development, possibly requiring revolutionary
NO, control techniques to maintain compliance with NO,
certification standards.

"Fuel efficiency improvements are available through
improvements to the airframe, as well as the engine. Most
modern civil jet aircraft have low-mounted swept wings and
are powered by two or four turbofan engines mounted beneath
the wings. Such subsonic aircraft are about 70% more fuel
efficient per passenger-km than 40 years ago. The majority
of this gain has been achieved through engine improvements
and the remainder from airframe design improvements. A 20%
improvement in fuel efficiency of individual aircraft types is
projected by 2015 and a 40-50% improvement by 2050 relative
to equivalent aircraft produced today (IPCC, 1999). The
current aircraft configuration is highly evolved, but has scope
for further improvement. Technological developments have
to be demonstrated to offer proven benefits before they will
be adopted in the aviation industry, and this coupled with the
overriding safety requirements and a product lifetime that has
60% of aircraft in service at 30 years age (ICAO, 2003) results
in slower change than might be seen in other transport forms.

viable when crude prices reach (up to) 59 US$/barrel’. However, any alternative fuel for commercial aircraft will need to be
compatible with aviation kerosene (to obviate the need for tank and system flushing on re-fuelling) and meet a comprehensive
performance and safety specification.

"A potential non-carbon fuel is hydrogen and there have been
several studies on its use in aviation. An EC study (Airbus, 2004)
developed a conceptual basis for applicability, safety, and the
full environmental compatibility for a transition from kerosene
to hydrogen for aviation. The study concluded that conventional
aircraft designs could be modified to accommodate the larger
tank sizes necessary for hydrogen fuels. However, the increased
drag due to the increased fuselage volume would increase the
energy consumption of the aircraft by between 9% and 14%. The
weight of the aircraft structure might increase by around 23% as
a result, and the maximum take-off weight would vary between
+4.4% to —14.8% dependent on aircraft size, configuration and
mission. The hydrogen production process would produce CO,
unless renewable energy was used and the lack of hydrogen
production and delivery infrastructure would be a major obstacle.
The primary environmental benefit from the use of hydrogen
fuel would be the prevention of CO, emissions during aircraft
operation. But hydrogen fuelled aircraft would produce around
2.6 times more water vapour than the use of kerosene and water
vapour is a GHG. The earliest implementation of this technology
was suggested as between 15-20 years, provided that research
work was pursued at an appropriate level. The operating cost of
hydrogen-powered aircraft remains unattractive under today’s
economic conditions.

"Another type of operational system/mitigation potential is
to consider the total climate impact of aviation. Such studies
are in their infancy but were the subject of a major European
project ‘TRADE-OFF’. In this project different methods were
devised to minimize the total radiative forcing impact of
aviation; in practice this implies varying the cruise altitudes
as O; formation, contrails (and presumably cirrus cloud
enhancement) are all sensitive to this parameter. For example,
Fichter et al. (2005) found in a parametric study that contrail
coverage could be reduced by approximately 45% by flying
the global fleet 6,000 feet lower, but at a fuel penalty of 6%
compared with a base case. Williams ef al. (2003) also found
that regional contrail coverage was reduced by flying lower with
a penalty on fuel usage. By flying lower, NO, emissions tend
to increase also, but the removal rate of NO, is more efficient
at lower altitudes: this, compounded with a lower radiative
efficiency of O; at lower altitudes meant that flying lower could
also imply lower O, forcing (Grewe et al., 2002). Impacts on
cirrus cloud enhancement cannot currently be modelled in the
same way, since current estimates of aviation effects on cirrus
are rudimentary and based upon statistical analyses of air traffic
and satellite data of cloud coverage (Stordal et al., 2005) rather
than modelling. However, as Fichter et al. (2005) note, to a first
order, one might expect aviation-induced cirrus cloud to scale
with contrails. The overall ‘trade-offs’ are complex to analyse
since CO, forcing is long lasting, being an integral over time.
Moreover, the uncertainties on some aviation forcings (notably
contrail and cirrus) are still high, such that the overall radiative
forcing consequences of changing cruise altitudes need to be
considered as a time-integrated scenario, which has not yet been
done. However, if contrails prove to be worth avoiding, then
such drastic action of reducing all aircraft cruising altitudes
need not be done, as pointed out by Mannstein et al. (2005),
since contrails can be easily avoided — in principle — by
relatively small changes in flight level, due to the shallowness
of ice supersaturation layers. However, this more finely tuned
operational change would not necessarily apply to O; formation
as the magnitude is a continuous process rather than the case of
contrails that are either short-lived or persistent. Further intensive
research of the impacts is required to determine whether such
operational measures can be environmentally beneficial.

"In the past few years, the International Maritime Organization
(IMO) has started research and discussions on the mitigation
of GHG emissions by the shipping industry. The potential of
technical measures to reduce CO, emissions was estimated at
5-30% in new ships and 4—20% in old ships. These reductions
could be achieved by applying current energy-saving
technologies vis-a-vis hydrodynamics (hull and propeller) and
machinery on new and existing ships (Marintek, 2000).

"The vast majority of marine propulsion and auxiliary plants
onboard ocean-going ships are diesel engines. In terms of the
maximum installed engine output of all civilian ships above 100
gross tonnes (GT), 96% of this energy is produced by diesel
power. These engines typically have service lives of 30 years or
more. It will therefore be a long time before technical measures
can be implemented in the fleet on any significant scale. This
implies that operational emission abatement measures on
existing ships, such as speed reduction, load optimization,
maintenance, fleet planning, etc., should play an important role
if policy is to be effective before 2020.

The goal of RVSM (Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum)
is to reduce the vertical separation above flight level (FL) 290
from the current 610 m (2000 ft) minimum to 305 m (1000 ft)
minimum. This will allow aircraft to safely fly more optimum
profiles, gain fuel savings and increase airspace capacity. The
process of safely changing this separation standard requires a
study to assess the actual performance of airspace users under
the current separation (610 m) and potential performance
under the new standard (305 m). In 1988, the ICAO Review
of General Concept of Separation Panel (RGCSP) completed
this study and concluded that safe implementation of the 305 m
separation standard was technically feasible.

"The long-term reduction potential, assuming implementation
of technical or operational measures, was estimated for the
major fuel consuming segments?5 of the world fleet as specific
case studies. The result of this analysis was that the estimated
CO, emission reduction potential of the world fleet would be
17.6% in 2010 and 28.2% in 2020. Even though this potential
is significant, it was noted that this would not be sufficient to
compensate for the effects of projected fleet growth (Marintek,
2000). Speed reduction was found to offer the greatest potential
for reduction, followed by implementation of new and improved
technology. Speed reduction is probably only economically
feasible if policy incentives, such as CO, trading or emissions
charges are introduced.
"	Text
"A Eurocontrol study (Jelinek et al., 2002) tested the
hypothesis that the implementation of RVSM would lead to
reduced aviation emissions and fuel burn, since the use of
RVSM offers the possibility to optimise flight profiles more
readily than in the pre-existing ATC (Air Traffic Control)
regime. RVSM introduces six additional flight levels between
FL290 and FL410 for all States involved in the EUR RVSM
programme. The study analysed the effect from three days
of actual traffic just before implementation of RVSM in the
European ATC region, with three traffic days immediately after
implementation of RVSM. It concluded that a clear trend of
increasing environmental benefit was shown. Total fuel burn,
equating to CO, and H,O emissions, was reduced by between
1.6—2.3% per year for airlines operating in the European RVSM
area. This annual saving in fuel burn translates to around
310,000 tonnes annually, for the year 2003.

Speed comes at a cost in terms of fuel burn, although modern
jet aircraft are designed to fly at optimum speeds and altitudes
to maximise the efficiencies of their design. Flying slower
would be a possibility, but a different engine would be required
in order to maximise the efficiencies from such operation. The
propfan — this being a conventional gas turbine powering a
highly efficient rotating propeller system, as an open rotor or
unducted fan — is already an established technology and was
developed during the late 1980s in response to a significant
increase in fuel cost at the time. The scimitar shaped blades
are designed to minimise aerodynamic problems associated
with high blade speeds, although one problem created is the
noise generated by such devices. The fuel efficiency gains
from unducted fans, which essentially function as ultra high
bypass ratio turbofans, are significant and require the adoption
of lower aircraft speeds in order to minimise the helical mach
number at the rotating blade tip. Typically the maximum cruise
speed would be less than 400 miles per hour, compared with
550 mph for conventional jet aircraft. In the event the aero
acoustic problem associated with propfans could be overcome,
such aircraft might be suitable for short-haul operations where

several studies for the years 2010 and 2020 (Table 3.16 of the
TAR), with virtually all limited to single countries or to the
EU or OECD. Many of these studies indicated that substantial
reductions in transport GHG emissions could be achieved at
negative or minimal costs, although these results generally used
optimistic assumptions about future technology costs and/or
did not consider trade-offs between vehicle efficiency and other
(valued) vehicle characteristics. Studies undertaken since the

"techniques are not yet tested to an extent that they can compete
with diesel engines (Eyring et a/., 2005b). Furthermore, the
availability of alternative fuels is currently limited and time
is needed to establish the infrastructure for alternative fuels.
For these reasons, in the short term switching to alternative
fuels provides a limited potential in general, but a significant
potential for segments where a switch from diesel to natural gas
is possible (Skjolsvik, 2005). Switching from diesel to natural
gas has a 20% CO, reduction potential and is being pursued
as a measure in Norway for inland ferries and offshore supply
vessels operating on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The main
obstacle to the increased utilization of natural gas is the access
to LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) and the technology’s level of
costs compared to traditional ship solutions based on traditional
fuel (Skjolsvik, 2005). A co-benefit of a switch from diesel to
natural gas is that it also reduces emissions of SO, and NO, that
contribute to local air pollution in the vicinity of ports.

"For the long-term (2050), the economical CO, reduction
potential might be large. One potential option is a combination
of solar panels and sails. The use of large sails for super tankers
is currently being tested in Germany and looks promising
and may even be a cost-effective measure in the short term
in case oil prices continue to soar. The use of large sails does
not require fleet turnover but can be added to existing vessels
(retrofit). The introduction of hydrogen-propelled ships and the
use of fuel cell power at least for the auxiliary engines seem to
be a possibility as well. For larger vessels capable and reliable
fuel-cell-based ship propulsion systems are still a long way
into the future, but might be possible in 2050 (Eyring et al.,
2005b). Altmann et al. (2004) concluded that fuel cells offer
the potential for significant environmental improvements both
in air quality and climate protection. Local pollutant emissions
and GHG emissions can be eliminated almost entirely over the
full life cycle using renewable primary energies. The direct use
of natural gas in high temperature fuel cells employed in large
ships and the use of natural gas derived hydrogen in fuel cells
installed in small ships allows for a GHG emission reduction
of 20-40%.

"The following estimate of the overall GHG emissions
reduction potential and costs for improving the efficiency of
the world’s light-duty vehicle fleet (thus reducing carbon
emissions), is based on the IEA Reference Case, as documented
in a spreadsheet model developed by the IEA for the Mobility
2030 project (WBSCD, 2004b). The cost estimates for total
mitigation potential are provided in terms of ‘societal’ costs
of reductions in GHG emissions, measured in US$/tonne of
carbon (tC) or carbon dioxide (CO,); the costs are the net of
higher vehicle costs minus discounted lifetime fuel savings.
Fuel savings benefits are measured in terms of the untaxed cost
of the fuels at the retail level, and future savings are discounted
at a low societal rate of 4% per year. These costs are not the
same as those that would be faced by consumers, who would
face the full taxed costs of fuel, would almost certainly use a
higher discount rate, and might value only a few years of fuel
savings. Also, they do not include the consumer costs of forgoing
further increases in vehicle performance and weight. Over the
past few decades, increasing acceleration performance and
vehicle weight have stifled increases in fuel economy for light-
duty vehicles and these trends must be stopped if substantial
progress is to be made in fleet efficiency. Because consumers
value factors such as vehicle performance, stopping these trends
will have a perceived cost — but there is little information about
its magnitude.

efficiency scenario actually reducing fuel consumption in this
group of nations by 9% and the Medium efficiency scenario
reducing growth to only 6%. This regional decrease (or modest
increase) in fuel use is overwhelmed by the rapid growth in
the world’s total fleet size and overall travel demand and the
slower uptake of efficiency technologies in the developing
nations. Because no change in the use of biofuels was assumed
in this analysis, the CO, emissions in the scenarios essentially
track the energy consumption paths discussed above. Figure

resulting in a mitigation potential of about 800 (High) and 400

"Several studies have examined the fuel economy benefits of simultaneously applying multiple efficiency technologies to
light-duty vehicles. However, most of these are difficult to compare because they examine various types of vehicles, on
different driving cycles, using different technology assumptions, for different time frames. The Massachusetts Institute of
Technology has developed such an assessment for 2020 (MIT, 2000) with documentation of basic assumptions though
with few details about the specific technologies that achieve these values, for a medium size passenger car driving over
the official US Environmental Protection Agency driving cycle (Heywood et al., 2003). There are two levels of technology
improvement — ‘baseline’ and ‘advanced,’ with the latter level of improvement further subdivided into conventional and
hybrid drive trains.
"	Text
"The combined effects of applying this full range of technologies are quite dramatic (Table 5.9). From current test values
of 30.6 mpg (7.69 litres/100 km) as a 2001 reference, baseline 2020 gasoline vehicles obtain 43.2 mpg (5.44 L/100 km),
advanced gasoline vehicles 49.2 mpg (4.78 L/100 km) and gasoline hybrids 70.7 mpg (3.33 L/100 km); advanced diesels
obtain 58.1 mpg (4.05 L/100 km) and diesel hybrids 82.5 mpg (2.85 L/100 km) (note that on-road values will be at least 15%
lower). In comparison, Ricardo Consulting Engineers (Owen and Gordon, 2002) estimate the potential for achieving 92 g/km
CO, emissions, equivalent to 68.6 mpg (3.43 L/100 km), for an advanced diesel hybrid medium size car ‘without’ substantive
non-drive train improvements. This is probably a bit more optimistic than the MIT analysis when accounting for the additional
effects of reduced vehicle mass, tyre rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag coefficient.
"	Text
"Some of the key features of the 2020 vehicles are:

e

Vehicle mass is reduced by 15% (baseline) and 22% (advanced) by a combination of greater use of high strength steel,
aluminium and plastics coupled with advanced design;

Tyre rolling resistance coefficient is reduced from the current .009 to .008 (baseline) and .006 (advanced);

Drag coefficient is reduced to 0.27 (baseline) and 0.22 (advanced). The baseline level is at the level of the best current
vehicles, while the advanced level should be readily obtainable for the best vehicles in 2020, but seems quite ambitious
for a fleet average;

Indicated engine efficiency increases to 41% in both baseline and advanced versions. This level of efficiency would likely
require direct injection, full valve control (and possibly camless valves) and advanced engine combustion strategies.

"The Table 5.11 results show that the ‘social cost of carbon
reduction’ for light-duty vehicles varies dramatically across
regions and with fuel prices (since the cost is the net of
technology costs minus the value of fuel savings). The results
are also quite different for the High and Medium efficiency
scenarios, primarily because the estimated technology costs
begin to rise more steeply at higher efficiency levels, raising
the average cost/tonne of CO, in the High efficiency scenario.
For the High efficiency scenario, CO, reduction costs are very
high for the OECD countries aside from North America, even at
60 US$/bbI oil prices, reflecting the ambitious (and expensive)
increases in that scenario, the relatively high efficiencies of
those regions’ fleets in the Reference Case, and the relatively
low km/vehicle/year driven outside North America; on the

noted, vehicle purchasers would undoubtedly use higher

"Case 2 is a simple representation of planned industry

technology developments. This is an artificial case, as on-going
efficiency improvements would occur as a matter of course,
but it shows that these planned fleet developments alone
might save 14% of the CO, that the ‘no technology change’
of Case 1 would have produced. Case 3 should be regarded as
the ‘base case’ from which benefits are measured, as this case
reflects an agreed fuel efficiency trend assumed for some of the
calculations produced in the IPCC Special Report (1999). This
results in a further 11% reduction in CO, by 2030 compared
with Case 2. Cases 4 and 5 assume that a carbon cost will drive
additional technology developments from 2005 — no additional

100% from the base year. The cost potentials for Cases 4 and

"Energy use for urban transport is determined by a number of
factors, including the location of employment and residential
locations. In recent decades, most cities have been increasing
their dependence on the automobile and decreasing dependence
on public transport. In some cases increasing motorization
is the result of deliberate planning — what became known as
‘predict and provide’ (The Royal Commission on Transport
and the Environment, 1994; Goodwin, 1999). This planning
and programming process played a central role in developed
countries during the second half of the 20‘ century. In many
developing countries, the process of motorization and road
building is less organized, but is generally following the same
motorization path, often at an accelerated rate.

"A wide array of policies and strategies has been employed
in different circumstances around the world to restrain vehicle
usage, manage traffic congestion and reduce energy use, GHGs,
and air pollution. There tends to be considerable overlap among
these policies and strategies, often with synergistic effects.
The recent history almost everywhere in the world has been
increasing travel, bigger vehicles, decreasing land-use densities
and sprawling cities. But some cities are far less dependent
on motor vehicles and far denser than others, even at the
same incomes. The potential exists to greatly reduce transport
energy use and GHG emissions by shaping the design of cities,
restraining motorization and altering the attributes of vehicles
and fuels. Indeed, slowing the growth in vehicle use through
land-use planning and through policies that restrain increases in
vehicle use would be an important accomplishment. Planning
and policy to restrain vehicles and densify land use not only
lead to reduced GHG emissions, but also reduced pollution,
traffic congestion, oil use, and infrastructure expenditures and
are generally consistent with social equity goals as well.

smaller than the income elasticities of demand. In the long run
the income elasticity of demand is a factor 1.5—3 higher than

"Although the focus here is on transport pricing options to
limit CO, emissions, it should be recognized that many projects
and policies with that effect are not focused on GHG emissions
but rather on other objectives. A pricing policy may well aim
simultaneously at reducing local pollution and GHG emissions,
accidents, noise and congestion, as well as generating State
revenue for enlarging of social welfare and/or infrastructure
construction and maintenance. Every benefit with respect to
these objectives may then be assessed simultaneously through
CBA or MCA; they may be called co-benefits. Governments
can take these co-benefits into account when considering the
introduction of transport pricing such as for fuel. This is all the
more important since a project could be not worth realising if
only one particular benefit is considered, whereas it could very
well be proved beneficial when adding all the co-benefits.

"Empirically, throughout the last 30 years, regions with
relatively low fuel prices have low fuel economy (USA,
Canada, Australia) and regions where relatively high fuel prices
apply (due to fuel taxes) have better car fuel economy (Japan
and European countries). For example, fuel taxes are about 8
times higher in the UK than in the USA, resulting in fuel prices
that are about three times higher. UK vehicles are about twice
as fuel-efficient; mileage travelled is about 20% lower and
vehicle ownership is lower as well. This also results in lower
average per capita fuel expenditures. Clearly, automobile use
is sensitive to cost differences in the long run (VTPI, 2005).
In theory, long run impact of increases in fuel prices on fuel
consumption are likely to be about 2 to 3 times greater than
short run impact (VTPI, 2005). Based on the price elasticities
(Goodwin et al., 2004) judged to be the best defined results

"Switzerland: In January 2001, trucks of maximum 35 tonnes weight were allowed on Swiss territory (previously 28 tonnes)
and a tax of 1.00 cent/tkm (for the vehicle middle emission category) was imposed on trucks above 3.5 tonnes on all
roads. It replaced a previous fixed tax on heavy-duty vehicles. The tax is raised electronically. Since 2005, the tax is higher
at 1.60 cent/tkm, but 40 tonnes trucks are allowed. Over the period 2001-2003, it was estimated that it contributed to an
11.9% decrease in vehicle-km and a 3.5% decrease in tonnes-km of domestic traffic. The tax led to an improved carriers’
productivity and it is anticipated that, for that reason, emissions of CO, and NO, would decrease over the period 2001-2007
by 6-8%. On the other hand transit traffic, which amounts to 10% of total traffic, was also affected in a similar way by the
new tax regime, so that the number of HDL has been decreasing at a rate of about 2-3% per year, while, at the same time,
increasing in terms of tonnes-km (ARE, 2004b; 2006). A part of the revenues are used to finance improvements to the rail

"Recent evidence suggests that the effect of CO, taxes and
high fuel prices may be having a shrinking effect in the more
car-dependent societies. While the evidence is solid that price
elasticities indicated in Table 5.15 and used by Goodwin were
indeed around —0.25 (i.e., 2.5% reduction in fuel for every 10%
increase in price), in earlier years, new evidence indicates a
quite different story. Small and Van Dender (2007) found that
price elasticities in the USA dropped to about —0.11 in the late
1990s, and Hughes e¢ al. (2006) found that they dropped even
further in 2001-2006, to about —0.04. The explanation seems
to be that people in the USA have become so dependent on
their vehicles that they have little choice but to adapt to higher
prices. One might argue that these are short term elasticities, but
the erratic nature of gasoline prices in the USA (and the world)
result in drivers never exhibiting long-term behavior. Prices
drop before they seriously consider changing work or home
locations or even buying more efficient vehicles. If oil prices
continue to cycle up and down, as many expect, drivers may
continue to cling to their current behaviors. If so, CO, taxes
would have small and shrinking effects in the USA and other
countries where cars are most common.

"As an alternative to fuel taxes, registration and circulation
taxes can be used to incentivise the purchase (directly) and
manufacturing (indirectly) of fuel-efficient cars. This could be
done through a revenue neutral fee system, where fuel-efficient
cars receive a rebate and guzzler cars are faced with an extra
fee. There is evidence that incentives given through registration
taxes are more effective than incentives given through annual
circulation taxes (Annema et al., 2001). Buyers of new cars
do not expect to be able to pass on increased registration taxes
when selling the vehicle. Due to refunds on registration taxes
for cars that were relatively fuel efficient compared to similar
sized cars, the percentage of cars sold in the two most fuel
efficient classes increased from 0.3%-3.2% (cars over 20%
more fuel efficient than average) and from 9.5%-16.1% (for
cars between 10 and 20% more fuel efficient than average) in
the Netherlands (ADAC, 2005). After the abolishment of the
refunds, shares decreased again. COWI (2002) modelled the
impact on fuel efficiency of reforming current registration
and circulation taxes so they would depend fully on the CO,
emissions of new cars. Calculated reduction percentages varied
from 3.3—8.5% for 9 European countries, depending on their
current tax bases.

"Policies to promote biofuels are prominent in national emissions abatement strategies. Since benefits of biofuels for CO,
mitigation mainly come from the well-to-tank part, incentives for biofuels are more effective climate policies if they are tied
to the whole well-to-wheels CO, efficiencies. Thus preferential tax rates, subsi-dies and quotas for fuel blending should
be calibrated to the benefits in terms of net CO, savings over the whole well-to-wheel cycle associated with each fuel.
Development of an index of CO, savings by fuel type would be useful and if agreed internationally could help to liberalise
markets for new fuels. Indexing incentives would also help to avoid discrimination between feedstocks. Subsidies that
support production of specific crops risk being counterproductive to emission policies in the long run (ECMT, 2007). In order
to avoid negative effects of biofuel production on sustainable development (e.g. biodiversity impacts), additional conditions
could be tied to incentives for biofuels.

Japanese manufacturers following in 2009. Recent slowing
of the rate of efficiency improvement has raised doubts that
the manufacturers will achieve the 2008 and 2009 targets
(Kageson, 2005).

Japan: a 2010 target of about 35.5 mpg (6.6 L/100 km) for
new gasoline passenger vehicles, using the Japan 10/15
driving cycle based on weight-class standards.

China: weight-class standards that are applied to each new
vehicle using the NEDC driving cycle, with target years
of 2005 and 2008. At the historical mix of vehicles, the
standards are equivalent to fleet targets of about 30.4 mpg
(7.7 L/100 km) by 2005 and 32.5 mpg (7.2 L/100 km) by
2008 (An and Sauer, 2004).

Australia: a 2010 target for new vehicles of 18% reduction
in average fuel consumption relative to the 2002 passenger

The State of California has established GHG emission

standards. For example, the US National Research Council
(NRC, 2002) estimates that US light-duty vehicle fuel economy
can be increased by 25-33% within 15 years with existing
technologies that cost less than the value of fuel saved. A study
by Ricardo Consulting Engineers for the UK Department for
Transport (Owen and Gordon, 2002) develops a step-wise
series of improvements in a baseline diesel passenger car that
yields a 38% reduction in CO, emissions (a 61% increase in fuel
economy), to 92 g/km, by 2013 using parallel hybrid technology
at an incremental cost of 2300-3,100 £ (4200-5700 US$) with
a 15,300 £ (28,000 US$) baseline vehicle. Even where fuel
savings will outweigh the cost of new technologies, however,
the market will not necessarily adopt these technologies by
itself (or achieve the maximum fuel economy benefits from the
technologies even if they are adopted). Two crucial deterrents
are, first, that the buyers of new vehicles tend to consider only
the first three years or so of fuel savings (NRC, 2002; Annema
et al., 2001), and second, that vehicle buyers will take some

"Transport Demand Management (TDM) is a formal
designation for programmes in many countries that improve
performance of roads by reducing traffic volumes (Litman,
2003). There are many potential TDM strategies in these
programmes with a variety of impacts. Some improve transport
diversity (the travel options available to users). Others provide
incentives for users to reduce driving, changing the frequency,
mode, destination, route or timing of their travel. Some reduce
the need for physical travel through mobility substitutes or
more efficient land use. Some involve policy reforms to correct
current distortions in transport planning practices. TDM is
particularly appropriate in developing country cities, because
of its low costs, multiple benefits and potential to redirect the
motorization process. In many cases, effective TDM during
early stages of development can avoid problems that would
result if communities become too automobile dependent. This
can help support a developing country’s economic, social and
environmental objectives (Gwilliam et al., 2004).

"achieving the standards). Basing the standard on vehicle
wheelbase times track width may provide safety benefits by
providing a positive incentive to maintain or increase these
attributes. Using a uniform standard for all vehicles or for
large classes of vehicles (as in the US) is simple and easy to
explain, but creates quite different challenges on different
manufacturers depending on the market segments they
focus on.

Allowing trading of fuel economy ‘credits’ among different
vehicles or vehicle categories in an automaker’s fleet, or
even among competing automakers, will reduce the overall
cost of standards without reducing the total societal benefits,
but may incur political costs from accusations of allowing
companies or individuals to ‘buy their way out’ of efficiency
requirements.

Alternatives (or additions) to standards are worth
investigating. For example, ‘feebates’, which award cash
rebates to new vehicles whose fuel economy is above a
designated level (often the fleet average) and charge a fee
to vehicles with lower fuel economy, may be an effective
market-based measure to increase fleet fuel economy. An
important advantage of feebates is that they provide a
‘continuous’ incentive to improve fuel economy, because
an automaker can always gain a market advantage by
introducing vehicles that are more efficient than the current
average.

"Basing stringency decisions on existing standards elsewhere
requires careful consideration of differences between the
home market and compared markets in fuel quality and
availability; fuel economy testing methods; types and
sizes of vehicles sold; road conditions that may affect
the robustness of key technologies; and conditions that
may affect the availability of technologies, for example,
availability of sophisticated repair facilities.

There are a number of different approaches to selecting
stringency levels for new standards. Japan selected its
weight class standards by examining ‘top runners’ —
exemplary vehicles in each weight class that could serve as
viable targets for future fleet wide improvements. Another
approach is to examine the costs and fuel saving effects
of packages of available technologies on several typical
vehicles, applying the results to the new vehicle fleet (NRC,
2002). Other analyses have derived cost curves (percent
increase in fuel economy compared with technology cost)
for available technology and applied these to corporate or
national fleets (Plotkin et a/., 2002). These approaches are
not technology-forcing, since they focus on technologies
that have already entered the fleet in mass-market form.
More ambitious standards could demand the introduction
of emerging technologies. Selection of the appropriate level
of stringency depends, of course, on national goals and
concerns. Further, the selection of enforcement deadlines
should account for limitations on the speed with which
vehicle manufacturers can redesign multiple models and
introduce the new models on a schedule that avoids severe
economic disruption.

The structure of the standard is as important as its level of
stringency. Basing target fuel economy on vehicle weight
(Japan, China) or engine size (Taiwan, South Korea) will
tend to even out the degree of difficulty the standards impose
on competing automakers, but will reduce the potential fuel
economy gains that can be expected (because weight-based
standards eliminate weight reduction and engine-size-based
standards eliminate engine downsizing as viable means of

"Employer travel reduction strategies gained prominence
from a late 1980s regulation in southern California that required
employers with 100 or more employees to adopt incentives and
tules to reduce the number of car trips by employees commuting
to work (Giuliano et al., 1993). The State of Washington in the
USA kept a state law requiring travel plans in its most urban
areas for employers with 100 or more staff. The law reduced
the percentage of employees in the targeted organizations who
drove to work from 72-68% and affected about 12% of all trips
made in the area. In the Netherlands, the reduction in single
occupant commute trips from a travel plan averaged 5—15%.
In the UK, in very broad terms, the average effectiveness of
UK travel plans might be 6% in trips by drive alone to work
and 0.74% in the total vehicle-km travelled to work by car. The
overall effectiveness was critically dependent on both individual
effectiveness and levels of plan take-up (Rye, 2002).

(Veca and Kuzmyak, 2005) based on a non-zero initial parking
price. The State of California enacted legislation that required
employers with 50 or more persons who provided parking
subsidies to offer employees the option to choose cash in
lieu of a leased parking space, in a so-called parking cash-out
programme. In eight case studies of employers who complied
with the cash-out programme, the solo driver share fell from
76% before cashing out to 63% after cashing out, leading to
the reduction in vehicle-km for commuting by 12%. If all the

A major difficulty in developing a mitigation policy for the
climate impacts of aviation is how to cover non-CO, climate
impacts, such as the emission of nitrogen oxides (NO,) and the
formation of condensation trails and cirrus clouds (see also Box
5.1 in section 5.2). IPCC (1999) estimated these effects to be
about 2 to 4 times greater than those of CO, alone, even without
considering the potential impact of cirrus cloud enhancement.
This means that the perceived environmental effectiveness of
any mitigation policy will depend on the extent to which these
non-CO, climate effects are also taken into account.

"If emission trading or emission charges were applied to
the aviation sector in isolation, the two instruments would in
principle be equivalent in terms of cost-effectiveness. However,
combining the reduction target for aviation with the emission
trading scheme of other sectors increases overall economic
efficiency by allowing the same amount of reductions to be
made at a lower overall cost to society. Therefore, if aviation
were to achieve the same environmental goal under emission
trading and emission charges, the economic costs for the sector
and for the economy as a whole would be lower if this was done
under an emission trading scheme including other sectors rather
than under a charging system for aviation only.
"	Text
"Another possible approach is, in case of emission trading
for aviation, a requirement to surrender a number of emission
permits corresponding to its CO, emissions multiplied by a
precautionary average factor reflecting the climate impacts
of non-CO, impacts. It should be emphasised that the metric
that is a suitable candidate for incorporating the non-CO,
climate impacts of aviation in a single metric that can be used
as a multiplier requires further development, being fairly
theoretical at present. The feasibility of arriving at operational
methodologies for addressing the full climate impact of aviation
depends not only on improving scientific understanding of
non-CO, impacts, but also on the potential for measuring or
calculating these impacts on individual flights.

aviation, total air transport demand will be reduced by about
1% compared to a base case scenario (FESG2010). In this
calculation, a 2010 target of 95% of the 1990-level was assumed
for aviation on routes from and to Annex-I countries and the
more developed non-Annex-I countries such as China, Hong
Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Korea and Brazil. Furthermore a
permit price of 20 US$/tCO, was assumed. Given the relative
high abatement costs in the aviation sector, this scenario would
imply that the aviation sector would buy permits from other
sectors for about 3.3 billion USS.

"In view of the difficulty of reaching global consensus on
mitigation policies to reduce GHG emissions from international
aviation, the European Commission decided to prepare climate
policies for aviation. On 20 December 2006 the European
Commission presented a legislative proposal that brings aviation
emissions into the existing EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU
ETS). The proposed directive will cover emissions from flights
within the EU from 2011 and all flights to and from EU airports
from 2012. Both EU and foreign aircraft operators would be
covered. The environmental impact of the proposal may be
significant because aviation emissions, which are currently
growing rapidly, will be capped at their average level in 2004—
2006. By 2020 it is estimated by model analysis that a total of
183 MtCO, will be reduced per year on the flights covered,
a 46% reduction compared with business-as-usual. However,
aviation reduces the bulk of this amount through purchasing
allowances from other sectors and through additional supply
of Joint Implementation and Clean Development Mechanism
credits. In 2020 aviation reduces its own emissions by 3%

be applicable to other emissions, including CO. According to
a follow-up study by Harrison et a/. (2005) the main obstacles
to a programme of voluntary port dues differentiation are to
provide an adequate level of incentive, alleviating ports’
competitive concerns and reconciling differentiation with
specially negotiated charges. Swedish experience suggests
that when combined with a centrally determined mandatory

However, in many cases a voluntary system would not likely

"A number of hurdles have to be overcome before such a
system could become operational. The main bottleneck appears
to be that there is major variation in the fuel efficiency of similar
ships, which is not yet well understood (Wit et al., 2004). This
is illustrated by research by the German delegation of IMO’s
Working Group on GHG emission reduction (IMO, 2004),
in which the specific energy efficiency (i.e., a CO, emission
index) was calculated for a range of container ships, taking
into account engine design factors rather than operational data.
The results of this study show that there is considerable scatter
in the specific engine efficiency of the ships investigated,
which could not be properly explained by the deadweight
of the ships, year of build, ship speed and several other ship
design characteristics. The paper therefore concludes that the
design of any CO, indexing scheme and its differentiation
according to ship type and characteristics, requires in-depth
investigation. Before such a system can be used in an incentive
scheme, the reasons for the data scatter need to be understood.
This is a prerequisite for reliable prediction of the economic,
competitive and environmental effects of any incentive based
on this method.

public transport, notably suburban and regional passenger

generally emits fewer GHGs per passenger-km, the net effect
of these subsidies has not been quantified. It depends on the
balance between increased GHG emissions due to higher

relatively less efficient transport modes.

"A quantitative appraisal of the effect of subsidies on GHG
emissions is very complicated (Nash ef al., 2002). Not only
have shifts between fuels and transport modes to be taken into

structure also needs to be analysed. As a result, reliable
quantitative assessments are almost non-existent (OECD,

subsidies that definitely raise the level of GHG emissions include
subsidies on fossil transport fuels, subsidies on commuting and
subsidies on infrastructure investments.

policy in the transport sector in most countries. Policies and
measures are often primarily intended to achieve energy

improvements in air pollution, congestion, access to transport

development. Achieving GHG reduction is therefore often
seen as a co-benefit of policies and measures intended for
sustainable transport in the countries. On the other hand, there
are many transport policies that lead to an increase in GHG

Globally, transport subsidies are ‘significant in economic

estimated that transport subsidies affect over 40% of world
trade. In a competitive environment (not necessarily under full
competition), subsidies decrease the price of transport. This
results in the use of transport above its equilibrium value and
most of the time also results in higher emissions, although this
depends on the type of subsidy. Secondly, they decrease the
incentive to economise on fuel, either by driving efficiently or
by buying a fuel-efficient vehicle.

pollution and climate change, there are also trade-offs. Diesel
engines are generally more fuel-efficient than gasoline engines
and thus have lower CO, emissions, but increase particle
emissions. Air quality driven measures, like obligatory particle
matter (PM) and NO, filters and in-engine measures, do not
result in higher fuel use if appropriate technologies are used,
like Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)- NO, catalyst.
"	Text
"Other examples of worthwhile policies can be given. The
policy of increasing trucks’ weight and best practices awareness
in Sweden, UK and the Netherlands lead to a consolidation of
loads that resulted in economic benefits as well as environmental
benefits, including a decrease in CO, emissions (MacKinnon,
2005; Leonardi and Baumgartner, 2004). Likewise, the Swiss
heavy vehicle fee policy also leads to better loaded vehicles and
a decrease of 7% in CO, emissions (ARE, 2004a).

"would be compensated by increased health benefits from the
accompanying reduction in particulate matter (Aunan et al.,
1998). McKinley et al. (2003) analyzed several integrated
environmental strategies for Mexico City. They conclude
that measures to improve the efficiency of transport are the
key to joint local/global air pollution control in Mexico City.
The three measures in this category that were analyzed, taxi
fleet renovation, metro expansion and hybrid buses, all have
monetized public health benefits that are larger than their costs
when the appropriate time horizon is considered.

"A simulation of freight traffic over the Belgian network
indicated that a policy of internalizing the marginal social costs
caused by freight transport types would induce a change in the
modal shares of trucking, rail and inland waterways transport.
Trucking would decrease by 26% and the congestion cost it
created by 44%. It was estimated that the total cost of pollution
and GHG emissions (together) would decrease by 15.4%, the
losses from accidents diminish by 24%, the cost of noise by
20% and wear and tear by 27%. At the same time, the total
energy consumption by the three modes would decrease by
21% (Beuthe et al., 2002).

"Under the Integrated Environmental Strategies Program
of the US EPA, analysis of public health and environmental
benefits of integrated strategies for GHG mitigation and local
environmental improvement is supported and promoted in
developing countries. A mix of measures for Chile has been
proposed, aimed primarily at local air pollution abatement and
energy saving. Measures in the transport sector (CNG buses,
hybrid diesel-electric buses and taxi renovation) proved to
provide little ancillary benefits in the field of climate policy, see
Figure 5.19. Only congestion charges were expected to have
substantial ancillary benefits for GHG reduction (Cifuentes et
al., 2001, Cifuentes & Jorquera, 2002).

"In the City of London a congestion charge was introduced
in February 2003, to reduce congestion. Simultaneous with
the introduction of the charge, investment in public transport
increased to provide a good alternative. The charge is a fee for
motorists driving into the central London area. It was introduced
in February 2003. Initially set at 5 £/day (Monday to Friday,
between 7 am and 6.30 pm), it was raised to 8 £ in July 2005.
The charge will be extended to a larger area in 2007. On a cost-
benefit rating, the results of the charge are not altogether clear
(Prud’homme and Bocarejo, 2005, Mackie, 2005). However, it
contributed to a 30% decrease of the traffic by the chargeable
vehicles in the area and less congestion, to higher speed of
private vehicles (+20%) and buses (+7%), and to an increased
use of public transport, plus more walking and bicycling. The
charge has had substantial ancillary benefits with respect to
air quality and climate policy. All the volume and substitution
effects in the charging zone has led to an estimated reductions
in CO, emissions of 20%. Primary emissions of NO, and
PM10 fell by 16% after one year of introduction (Transport for
London, 2006). A variant of that scheme has been in operation
since 1975 in Singapore with similar results; Stockholm is
presently experimenting with such a system, Trondheim, Oslo
and Durham are other examples.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
"	Title
"In 2004, emissions from the buildings sector including
through electricity use were about 8.6 GtCO,, 0.1 GtCO,-
eq N,O, 0.4 GtCO,-eq CH, and 1.5 GtCO,-eq halocarbons
(including CFCs and HCFCs). Using an accounting system
that attributes CO, emissions to electricity supply rather than
buildings end-uses, the direct energy-related carbon dioxide
emissions of the building sector are about 3 Gt/yr.
"	Text
"For the buildings sector the literature uses a variety of
baselines. Therefore a baseline was derived for this sector based
on the literature, resulting in emissions between the B2 and
AIB SRES scenarios, with 11.1 Gt of emissions of CO, in 2020
and 14.3 GtCO, in 2030 (including electricity emissions but
omitting halocarbons, which could conceivably be substantially
phased out by 2030).

"Measures to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from
buildings fall into one of three categories: reducing energy
consumption and embodied energy in buildings, switching to
low-carbon fuels including a higher share of renewable energy,
or controlling the emissions of non-CO, GHG gases.” This
chapter devotes most attention to improving energy efficiency
in new and existing buildings, which encompasses the most
diverse, largest and most cost-effective mitigation opportunities
in buildings.

"Implementing carbon mitigation options in buildings is
associated with a wide range of co-benefits. While financial
assessment has been limited, it is estimated that their overall
value may be higher than those of the energy savings benefits
(medium agreement, limited evidence). Economic co-benefits
include the creation of jobs and business opportunities,
increased economic competitiveness and energy security. Other
co-benefits include social welfare benefits for low-income
households, increased access to energy services, improved
indoor and outdoor air quality, as well as increased comfort,

"Our survey of the literature (80 studies) indicates that there is
a global potential to reduce approximately 29% of the projected
baseline emissions by 2020 cost-effectively in the residential
and commercial sectors, the highest among all sectors studied
in this report (high agreement, much evidence). Additionally at
least 3% of baseline emissions can be avoided at costs up to
20 US$/tCO, and 4% more if costs up to 100 US$/tCO, are
considered. However, due to the large opportunities at low-
costs, the high-cost potential has been assessed to a limited
extent, and thus this figure is an underestimate (high agreement,
much evidence).

"Using the global baseline CO, emission projections for
buildings, these estimates represent a reduction of approximately
3.2, 3.6 and 4.0 GtCO,/yr in 2020, at zero, 20 US$/tCO, and
100 US$/tCO, respectively. Our extrapolation of the potentials
to the year 2030 suggests that, globally, about 4.5, 5.0 and
5.6 GtCO, at negative cost, <20 US$ and <100 US$/tCO,-eq
respectively, can be reduced (approximately 30, 35 and 40% of
the projected baseline emissions) (medium agreement, limited
evidence). These numbers are associated with significantly
lower levels of certainty than the 2020 ones due to very limited
research available for 2030.

"While occupant behaviour, culture and consumer choice and
use of technologies are also major determinants of energy use
in buildings and play a fundamental role in determining CO,
emissions (high agreement, limited evidence), the potential
reduction through non-technological options is rarely assessed
and the potential leverage of policies over these is poorly
understood. Due to the limited number of demand-side end-
use efficiency options considered by the studies, the omission
of non-technological options and the often significant co-
benefits, as well as the exclusion of advanced integrated highly
efficiency buildings, the real potential is likely to be higher
(high agreement, limited evidence).

"The key conclusion of the chapter is that substantial
reductions in CO, emissions from energy use in buildings can
be achieved over the coming years using mature technologies
for energy efficiency that already exist widely and that have
been successfully used (high agreement, much evidence). A
significant portion of these savings can be achieved in ways
that reduce life-cycle costs, thus providing reductions in CO,
emissions that have a net benefit rather than cost. However, due
to the long lifetime of buildings and their equipment, as well
as the strong and numerous market barriers prevailing in this
sector, many buildings do not apply these basic technologies
to the level life-cycle cost minimisation would warrant (high
agreement, much evidence).

"There is a broad array of accessible and cost-effective
technologies and know-how that have not as yet been widely
adopted, which can abate GHG emissions in buildings to a
significant extent. These include passive solar design, high-
efficiency lighting and appliances?, highly efficient ventilation
and cooling systems, solar water heaters, insulation materials
and techniques, high-reflectivity building materials and multiple
glazing. The largest savings in energy use (75% or higher)
occur for new buildings, through designing and operating
buildings as complete systems. Realizing these savings requires
an integrated design process involving architects, engineers,
contractors and clients, with full consideration of opportunities
for passively reducing building energy demands. Over the
whole building stock the largest portion of carbon savings by
2030 is in retrofitting existing buildings and replacing energy-
using equipment due to the slow turnover of the stock (high
agreement, much evidence).

reliable information on energy efficiency measures, lack of
proper incentives (e.g., between landlords who would pay for
efficiency and tenants who realize the benefits), limitations in
access to financing, subsidies on energy prices, as well as the
fragmentation of the building industry and the design process
into many professions, trades, work stages and industries. These
barriers are especially strong and diverse in the residential
and commercial sectors; therefore, overcoming them is only
possible through a diverse portfolio of policy instruments (high

"A variety of government policies have been demonstrated
to be successful in many countries in reducing energy-related
CO, emissions in buildings (high agreement, much evidence).
Among these are continuously updated appliance standards and
building energy codes and labelling, energy pricing measures
and financial incentives, utility demand-side management
programmes, public sector energy leadership programmes
including procurement policies, education and training
initiatives and the promotion of energy service companies. The
greatest challenge is the development of effective strategies for
retrofitting existing buildings due to their slow turnover. Since
climate change literacy, awareness of technological, cultural
and behavioural choices are important preconditions to fully
operating policies, applying these policy approaches needs
to go hand in hand with programmes that increase consumer
access to information and awareness and knowledge through

in this sector includes a lot of measures aimed at electricity
saving it is useful to compare the mitigation potential with
carbon dioxide emissions, including those through the use of
electricity. When including the emissions from electricity use,
energy-related carbon dioxide emissions were 8.6 Gt/yr (Price et

Next, a selection of these technologies and practices is illustrated
by a few examples, demonstrating the plethora of opportunities
to achieve GHG emission reductions as significant as 70-80%.
This is followed by a discussion of co-benefits from reducing

efficiency strategies focused on individual energy-using
devices or design features are often limited to incremental
improvements. Examining the building as an entire system can
lead to entirely different design solutions. This can result in new

"Asimple strategy for reducing heating and cooling loads is to
isolate the building from the environment by using high levels
of insulation, optimizing the glazing area and minimizing the
infiltration of outside air. This approach is most appropriate for
cold, overcast climates. A more effective strategy in most other
climates is to use the building envelope as a filter, selectively
accepting or rejecting solar radiation and outside air, depending
on the need for heating, cooling, ventilation and lighting at that
time and using the heat capacity of the building structure to
shift thermal loads on a time scale of hours to days.

"The actual performance of a building depends as much
on the quality of construction as on the quality of the design
itself. Building commissioning is a quality control process that
includes design review, functional testing of energy-consuming

owner and operators. Actual building energy performance also
depends critically on how well the building is operated and
maintained. Continuous performance monitoring, automated
diagnostics and improved operator training are complementary
approaches to improving the operation of commercial buildings

"The systems approach in turn requires an integrated design
process (IDP), in which the building performance is optimized
through an iterative process that involves all members of the

performance envelope and highly efficient equipment, properly

that optimises the equipment operation and human behaviour,
and (iii) fully commissioning and maintaining the equipment

the architect — can greatly influence the subsequent opportunities
to reduce building energy use. These include building form,
orientation, self-shading, height-to-floor-area ratio and
decisions affecting the opportunities for and effectiveness of
passive ventilation and cooling. Many elements of traditional
building designs in both developed and developing countries
have been effective in reducing heating and cooling loads.
Urban design, including the clustering of buildings and mixing
of different building types within a given area greatly affect
the opportunities for and cost of district heating and cooling

and the shares of different transport modes (Chapter 5, Section

"Improvements in the thermal envelope can reduce heating
requirements by a factor of two to four compared to standard
practice, at a few percent of the total cost of residential buildings,
and at little to no net incremental cost in commercial buildings
when downsizing of heating and cooling systems is accounted
for (Demirbilek et a/., 2000; Hamada et al., 2003; Hastings,
2004). A number of advanced houses have been built in various
cold-climate countries around the world that use as little as
10% of the heating energy of houses built according to the local
national building code (Badescu and Sicre, 2003; Hamada et al.,
2003; Hastings, 2004). Reducing the envelope and air exchange
heat loss by a factor of two reduces the heating requirement by
more than a factor of two because of solar gains and internal
heat gains from equipment, occupants and lighting. In countries
with mild winters but still requiring heating (including many
developing countries), modest (and therefore less costly)
amounts of insulation can readily reduce heating requirements
by a factor of two or more, as well as substantially reducing
indoor summer temperatures, thereby improving comfort (in
the absence of air conditioning) or reducing summer cooling
energy use (Taylor et al., 2000; Florides et al., 2002; Safarzadeh

Multi-unit residences and many single-family residences
(especially in Europe) use boilers, which produce steam or hot
water that is circulated, generally through radiators. Annual
Fuel Utilization Efficiencies (AFUE) values range from 80%
to 99% for the boiler, not including distribution losses. Modern
residential forced-air furnaces, which are used primarily in
North America, have AFUE values ranging from 78% to
97% (again, not including distribution system losses). Old
equipment tends to have an efficiency in the range of 60-70%,
so new equipment can provide substantial savings (GAMA
(Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association), 2005). In both
boilers and furnaces, efficiencies greater than about 88% require
condensing operation, in which some of the water vapour in the
exhaust is condensed in a separate heat exchanger. Condensing
boilers are increasingly used in Western Europe due to regulation
of new buildings, which require higher-efficiency systems.

with heat flows that have only 25-35% of the heat loss of
standard non-coated double-glazed (15 to 20% of single-

fraction of the incident solar radiation reduces solar heat gain
by up to 75%, thus reducing cooling loads. In spite of these
technical improvements, the costs of glazing and windows has
remained constant or even dropped in real terms (Jakob and

heat pump can operate in reverse, thereby cooling the indoor
space. In winter, drawing heat from a relatively warm source
(such as the ground rather than the outside air) and distributing
the heat at the lowest possible temperature can dramatically
improve the heat pump efficiency. Use of the ground rather
than the outside air as a heat source reduced measured energy
use for heating by 50 to 60% in two US studies (Shonder et al.,

climate; the same building forms and designs are now seen in
Stockholm, New York, Houston, Hong Kong, Singapore and

load for any climate are well known. In most climates, they
include: (i) orienting a building to minimize the wall area
facing east or west; (ii) clustering buildings to provide some
degree of self shading (as in many traditional communities in
hot climates); (iii) using high-reflectivity building materials;
(iv) increasing insulation; (v) providing fixed or adjustable

solar heat gain and a high daylight transmission factor and
avoiding excessive window area (particularly on east- and

Underground earth-pipe cooling consists of cooling
ventilation air by drawing outside air through a buried air duct.
Good performance depends on the climate having a substantial
annual temperature range. Desiccant dehumidification and
cooling involves using a material (desiccant) that removes
moisture from air and is regenerated using heat. Solid desiccants
are a commercially available technology. The energy used for
dehumidification can be reduced by 30 to 50% compared to a
conventional overcooling/reheat scheme (50 to 75% savings of
conventional sources if solar energy is used to regenerate the
desiccant) (Fischer et al., 2002; Niu et al., 2002). In hot-humid

many diffusers in the floor or along the sides of a room and
is warmed by internal heat sources (occupants, lights, plug-in

already present. The thermodynamic advantage of displacement

Aroom may be cooled by chilling a large fraction of the ceiling

ceiling (CC) cooling has been used in Europe since at least the
mid-1970s. In Germany during the 1990s, 10% of retrofitted
buildings used CC cooling (Behne, 1999). Significant energy
savings arise because of the greater effectiveness of water than
air in transporting heat and because the chilled water is supplied
at 16°C to 20°C rather than at 5°C to 7°C. This allows a higher
chiller COP when the chiller operates, but also allows more
frequent use of ‘water-side free cooling,’ in which the chiller is
bypassed altogether and water from the cooling tower is used
directly for space cooling. For example, a cooling tower alone
could directly meet the cooling requirements 97% of the time in
Dublin, Ireland and 67% of the time in Milan, Italy if the chilled

During the cooling season, the air is supplied at the coldest
temperature needed in any zone and reheated as necessary just
before entering other zones. There are a number of changes
in the design of HVAC systems that can achieve dramatic
savings in the energy use for heating, cooling and ventilation.
These include (i) using variable-air volume systems so as to
minimize simultaneous heating and cooling of air; (ii) using
heat exchangers to recover heat or coldness from ventilation
exhaust air; (ili) minimizing fan and pump energy consumption

changing building occupancy which alone can save 20 to 30%

electricity, heat and chilled water), or it can be produced through
a centralized chilling plant independent of power generation.
District cooling provides an alternative to separate chillers and
cooling towers in multi-unit residential buildings that would
otherwise use inefficient small air conditioners. In spite of the
added costs of pipes and heat exchangers in district heating
and cooling networks, the total capital cost can be less than the
total cost of heating and cooling units in individual buildings,

are discussed in Chapter 4, Section 4.3.3.6. Building-integrated
PV (BiPV) consists of PV modules that function as part of
the building envelope (curtain walls, roof panels or shingles,
shading devices, skylights). BiPV systems are sometimes
installed in new ‘showcase’ buildings even before the systems
are generally cost-effective. These early applications will
increase the rate at which the cost of BiPVs comes down and
the technical performance improves. A recent report presents
data on the cost of PV modules and the installed-cost of PV
systems in IEA countries (IEA, 2003b). Electricity costs from
BiPV at present are in the range of 0.30-0.40 US$/kWh in good

of HCFCs is generally lower than CFCs. The GWP of HFCs
is also generally lower than that of the CFCs, but generally
slightly higher than that of the HCFCs. The consumption
(production plus imports, minus exports, minus destruction) of
CFCs except for critical uses (e.g., medical devices) stopped
in 1996 in developed countries, while developing countries
have been given to 2010 to eliminate consumption. HCFCs
are being phased out, also for reasons of ozone depletion, but
will not be completely phased out of production until 2030
in developed countries and 2040 in developing countries.
Nevertheless, projected emissions of HCFCs and HFCs (and
ongoing emissions from CFC banks) are sufficiently high that
scenarios of halocarbon emissions related to buildings in 2015
show almost the same emissions as in 2002 (about 1.5 GtCO,-
eq. emissions). For the coming decade or longer, the bank of
CFCs in the stock of cooling equipment and foams is so large
that particular attention needs to be given to recovering these
CFCs.

"The previous sections have demonstrated that there is already
a plethora of technological, systemic and management options
available in buildings to substantially reduce GHG emissions.
This section aims at quantifying the reduction potential these
options represent, as well as the costs associated with their
implementation.
"	Text
"The literature on future non-CO, emissions and potentials for
their mitigation have been recently reviewed in the IPCC/TEAP
report (2005). The report identifies that there are opportunities
to reduce direct emissions significantly through the global
application of best practices and recovery methods, with a
reduction potential of about 665 million tonnes of CO,-eq of
"	Text
" 

If the approx. formula of Potential 999 = 1 - (1 - Potential 5;,)2°/10 is used to extrapolate the potential as percentage of the baseline into the future (2000 is assumed as a start
year), this corresponds to approx. 78% CO, savings in 2020.

In this chapter we refer to ‘cost-effective’ or ‘economic’ potential, to remain consistent with the energy-efficiency literature, considering a zero-carbon price.

Corresponds to an approx. 22% potential in 2020 if the extrapolation formula is used.

Corresponds to an approx. 38% potential in 2020 if the formula is applied to derive the intermediate potential.

For definitions of technical, economic, market and enhanced market potential, see Chapter 2 Section 2.4.3.1.

The baseline CO, emission projections were calculated on the basis of the reviewed studies, and are a composite of business-as-usual and frozen efficiency baseline.

These are the average figures of the low and high scenario of the potential developed for 2030.
"	List
"According to Table 6.2, estimates of technical potential
range from 18% of baseline CO, emissions in Pakistan (Asian
Development Bank, 1998) where only a limited number of
options were considered, to 54% in 2010° in a Greek study
(Mirasgedis et al., 2004) that covered a very comprehensive
range of measures in the residential sector. The estimates of
economic potential! vary from 12% in EU-15 in 2010!! (Joosen
and Blok, 2001) to 52% in Ecuador in 2030!2 (FEDEMA, 1999).
Estimates of market potential!? range from 14% in Croatia,
focusing on four options only (UNFCCC NCI of Croatia,
2001), to 37% in the USA, where a wide range of policies were
appraised (Koomey et al., 2001).
"	Text
"Chapter 3 of the TAR (IPCC, 2001) provided an overview of
the global GHG emission reduction potential for the residential
and commercial sectors, based on the work of IPCC (1996) and
Brown et al. (1998). An update of this assessment has been
conducted for this report, based on a review of 80 recent studies
from 36 countries and 11 country groups, spanning all inhabited
continents. While the current appraisal concentrates on new
results since the TAR, a few older studies were also revisited if
no recent study was located to represent a geopolitical region
in order to provide more complete global coverage. Table 6.2
reviews the findings of a selection of major studies on CO,
mitigation potential from various countries around the world
that could be characterized in a common framework. Since the
studies apply a variety of assumptions and analytical methods,
these results should be compared with caution (see the notes
for each row, for methodological aspects of such a comparison
exercise).
"	Text
"and commercial sectors (high agreement, much evidence).
Additionally at least 3% of baseline emissions can be avoided
at costs up to 20 US$/tCO, and 4% more if costs up to 100 US$/
tCO, are considered. Although due to the large opportunities at
low-costs, the high-cost potential has been assessed to a limited
extent and thus this figure is an underestimate (high agreement,
much evidence). These estimates represent a reduction of
approximately 3.2, 3.6 and 4.0 billion tonnes of CO,-eq in 2020,
at zero, 20 US$/tCO, and 100 US$/tCO,, respectively. Due to
the limited number of demand-side end-use efficiency options
considered by the studies, the omission of non-technological
options, the often significant co-benefits, as well as the exclusion
of advanced integrated highly efficiency buildings, the real
potential is likely to be higher (high agreement, low evidence).
While occupant behaviour, culture and consumer choice as
well as use of technologies are also major determinants of
energy consumption in buildings and play a fundamental role
in determining CO, emissions, the potential reduction through
non-technological options is not assessed. These figures are
very similar to those reported in the TAR for 2020, indicating
the dynamics of GHG reduction opportunities. As previous
estimates of additional energy efficiency and GHG reduction
potential begin to be captured in a new baseline, they tend to
be replaced by the identification of new energy-efficiency and
GHG-mitigation options. For comparison with other sectors
these potentials have been extrapolated to 2030. The robustness
of these figures is significantly lower than those for 2020 due
to the lack of research for this year. The extrapolation of the
potentials to the year 2030 suggests that, globally, at least
31% of the projected baseline emissions can be mitigated
cost-effectively by 2030 in the buildings sector. Additionally
at least 4% of baseline emissions can be avoided at costs up
to 20 US$/tCO, and 5% more at costs up to 100 US$/tCO,
(medium agreement, low evidence)!5. This mitigation potential
would result in a reduction of approximately 4.5, 5.0 and 5.6
billion tonnes of CO,-eq at zero, 20 US$/tCO, and 100 US$/
tCOy, respectively, in 2030. Both for 2020 and 2030, low-cost
potentials are highest in the building sector from all sectors
assessed in this report (see Table 11.3). The outlook to the long-
term future assuming options in the building sector with a cost
up to 25 US$/tCO, identifies the potential of approximately 7.7
billion tonnes of CO, in 2050 (IEA, 2006d).

"As mentioned above, only three studies covered the baseline or mitigation potential for 2030. Therefore these figures were
derived by extrapolating the 2020 figures to 2030. Since the simple exponential formula used for such extrapolations by
other sectors was found to yield disputably high or low results in some cases, a modified exponential function was used
which allows regulating the maximum potential considered theoretically achievable for different regions'’. The results of the
projections are presented in Table 6.4
"	Text
"Analogously, CO, potentials as a percentage of the baseline in cost categories (US$/tCO,: (<0); (0;20); (20;100)) were cal-
culated based on population weighted average potentials in the sub-regions for each cost category .While the three studies
using a frozen efficiency baseline result in a relatively higher potential than in studies using a BAU baseline, this does not
compromise the validity of the global potential, since for the regions applying a frozen efficiency baseline, the latter baseline
was used in calculating the global total. The results of these estimates are presented in Table 6.3.
"	Text
"This chapter evaluated the potential for GHG mitigation in buildings and associated costs based on the review of existing
national and regional potential estimates. For this purpose, over 80 studies containing bottom-up mitigation potential es-
timates for buildings were identified from 36 countries and 11 country groups covering all inhabited continents. One study

(AIM, 2004) covered the entire planet, but it was not suitable for the purposes of this report, as it assessed a very limited
number of mitigation options.
"	Text
"To allow the comparison of studies in a common framework, their main results and related assumptions were processed and
inserted into a database containing the key characteristics of the methods used and results. To eliminate the major effects
of different methodological assumptions, only those studies were selected for further analysis whose assumptions fell into a
range of common criteria. For instance, studies were only used for further assessment if their discount rates fell in the interval
of 3-10%. For studies which did not report their baseline projections, these were taken from the latest available National
Communications to the UNFCCC, or other recent related reports.
"	Text
"The next step was to aggregate the results into global and regional potential estimates, as a function of CO, costs. Only three
studies covered a 2030 target year and they were for countries with insignificant global emissions, thus this was only possible
for 2020 in the first iteration. Since few studies reported potentials as a function of cost (typically only technical/economic
or market potentials were reported), only 17 studies from the remaining subset meeting our other selection criteria could be
used. IPCC SRES or WEO scenarios could not be used as a baseline because little information is available for these on the
technology assumptions in buildings. In order to make sure the potentials are entirely consistent with the baseline, an aver-
age baseline was created from the studies used for the global potential estimates. For the global potential estimates and the
baseline construction, the world was split into seven regions'®. For each such region, two to four studies were located, thus
dividing each region into two to four sub-regions represented by these marker countries in terms of emission growth rates
and potential as a percentage of baseline. CO, baseline emissions in the seven regions were estimated starting with 2000
IPCC A1B and B2 (SRES) data and applying the CO, growth rates calculated for each region as the population weighted
average CO, baseline growth rates of two to four sub-regions. The baseline projections were estimated for 2000-2020 based
on mainly 2020 data from the studies; these trends were prolonged for the period 2020-2030. Since three of the seventeen
studies used a frozen efficiency baseline, the baseline used in this chapter can be considered a business-as-usual one with
some frozen efficiency elements. The resulting baseline is higher than the B2 (SRES) scenario but lower than A1B (SRES)
and WEO scenarios.

"direct emissions in 2015, as compared to the BAU scenario.
About 40% of this potential is attributed to HFC emission
reduction covered by the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC,
while HCFCs and CFCs regulated by the Montreal Protocol
contribute about 60% of the potential. A key factor determining
whether this potential will be realized is the costs associated
with the implementation of the measures to achieve the emission
reduction. These vary considerably from a net benefit to 300
US$/tCO,-eq. Refrigeration applications and stationary and
mobile air conditioning contribute most to global direct GHG
emissions. Action in these sub-sectors could therefore have a
substantial influence on future emissions of HCFCs and HFCs.
The available literature does not contain reliable estimates
for non-CO, mitigation potentials in the long-term future,
including the year 2030. Therefore, the 2015 figures can serve
as low estimates of the potentials in 2030, taking into account
that upcoming progressive policies in many countries have
already led to new products with very low non-CO, emissions

"From a policy-design perspective, it is important to
understand which technologies/end-uses entail the lowest
unit abatement costs for society, as well as which ones offer
the largest abatement potential. This section reviews the most
attractive mitigation options in terms of overall potential. Both
Table 6.4 and Table 11.3 in Chapter 11 demonstrate that CO,-
saving options are largest from fuel use in developed countries
and countries in transition due to their more northern locations
and, thus, larger potential for heat-saving measures. Conversely,
electricity savings constitute the largest potential in developing
countries located in the south, where the majority of emissions in
the buildings sector are associated with appliances and cooling.
This distribution of the potential also explains the difference in
mitigation costs between developing and developed countries.
The shift to more efficient appliances quickly pays back, while
building shell retrofits and fuel switching, together providing
approximately half of the potential in developed countries, are
more expensive.
"	Text
"Figure 6.4 depicts the potentials for CO, abatement as a
function of costs for eight selected recent detailed studies from
different world regions. The steepness of the curves, that is
the rate at which the costs of the measures increase as more of
the potential is captured, varies substantially by country and
by study. While the shape of each supply curve is profoundly
influenced by the underlying assumptions and methods used in
the study, the figure attests that opportunities for cost-effective
and low-cost CO, mitigation in buildings are abundant in each
world region. All eight studies covered here identified measures
at negative costs. The supply curves of developing countries
and economies in transition are characterized by a flat slope and
lie, in general, lower than the curves of developed countries.
The flat slope justifies the general perception (for instance,
which provided the main rationale for the Kyoto Flexibility
Mechanisms) that there is a higher abundance of ‘low-hanging
fruit’ in these countries. More concretely, the net costs of GHG
mitigation in buildings in these countries do not grow rapidly
even over 30-50% of emissions reductions. For developed
countries, the baseline scenario assumes that many of the low-
cost opportunities are already captured due to progressive
policies in place or in the pipeline.

lighting systems globally, at an average cost of US$—161/tCO).
In developing countries, efficient cooking stoves rank second,
while the second-place measures differ in the industrialized
countries by climatic and geographic region. Almost all studies
examining economies in transition (typically in cooler climates)
have found heating-related measures to be most cost-effective,
including insulation of walls, roofs, windows and floors, as well
as improved heating controls for district heat. In developed

"Despite the usefulness of supply curves for policy-making,
the methods used to create them rarely consider buildings as
integrated systems; instead, they focus on the energy savings
potential of incremental improvements to individual energy-
using devices. As demonstrated in the first part of this chapter,
integrated building design not only can generate savings that
are greater than achievable through individual measures, but
can also improve cost-effectiveness. This suggests that studies
relying solely on component estimates may underestimate
the abatement potential or overestimate the costs, compared
with a systems approach to building energy efficiency. Recent
published analyses show that, with an integrated approach, (i)
the cost of saving energy can go down as the amount of energy
saved goes up, and (ii) highly energy-efficient buildings can
cost less than buildings built according to standard practice
(Harvey, 2006; Chapter 13).

"In the least developed countries, one of the most important
opportunities for achieving GHG mitigation as well as
sustainable development in buildings is to focus on the health-
related benefits of clean domestic energy services, including
safe cooking. Indoor air pollution is a key environmental
and public health peril for countless of the world’s poorest,
most vulnerable people. Approximately three billion people
worldwide rely on biomass (wood, charcoal, crop residues and
dung) and coal to meet their household cooking and heating
energy needs (ITDG, 2002). Smoke from burning these fuels
contributes to acute respiratory infections in young children
and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults. These
health problems are responsible for nearly all of the 2.2 million
deaths attributable to indoor air pollution each year, over 98%
of which are in developing countries (Gopalan and Saksena,
1999; Smith et al., 2004), (See Box 6.2). In addition, women and
children also bear the brunt of the work of collecting biomass
fuel. Clean-burning cooking stoves not only save substantial
amounts of GHG emissions, but also prevent many of these

"Climate mitigation through energy efficiency in the
residential and commercial sectors will improve local and
regional air quality, particularly in large cities, contributing to
improved public health (e.g., increased life expectancy, reduced
emergency room visits, reduced asthma attacks, fewer lost
working days) and avoidance of structural damage to buildings
and public works. As an example in China, replacement of
residential coal burning by large boiler houses providing district
heating is among the abatement options providing the largest
net benefit per tonne of CO, reduction, when the health benefits
from improved ambient air conditions are accounted for (Mestl
et al., 2005). A study in Greece (Mirasgedis et al., 2004) found
that the economic GHG emissions abatement potential in the
residential sector could be increased by almost 80% if the
co-benefits from improved air quality are taken into account.
Beyond the general synergies between improved air quality
and climate change mitigation described in Chapter 11 (see
Section 11.8.1), some of the most important co-benefits in the
households of developing countries are due to reduced indoor
air pollution through certain mitigation measures, discussed in

around 3% per annum for wall insulation and 3.3% per annum
for double glazing windows, while real prices decreases of
0.6% since 1985 for facades and 25% over the last 30 years for

"Cleaner-burning improved cooking stoves (ICS), outlined in the previous sections of this chapter, help address many of the
problems associated with traditional cooking methods. The benefits derived from ICS are: 1) reduced health risks for women

energy use, which eases the pressure on the natural biomass resource; 4) a reduction in the amount of money spent on fuel
in urban areas; and 5) a reduction in fuel collection and cooking time, which translates into an increase in time available for
other economic and developmental activities.

"In developed countries, the diffusion of new technologies
for energy use and/or savings in residential and commercial
buildings contributes to an improved quality of life and
increases the value of buildings. Jakob (2006) lists examples of
this type of co-benefit, such as improved thermal comfort (fewer
cold surfaces such as windows) and the substantially reduced
level of outdoor noise infiltration in residential or commercial
buildings due to triple-glazed windows or high-performance
wall and roof insulation. At noisy locations, an improvement
of 10-15 dB could result in gross economic benefits up to the
amount of 3—7% of the rental income from a building (Jakob,
2006). Lastly, better-insulated buildings eliminate moisture
problems associated with, for example, thermal bridges and
damp basements and thus reduce the risk of mould build-up
and associated health risks.

revenues in Section 6.8.3.5 demonstrates that the energy
services business appears to be both a very promising and a
quickly growing business sector worldwide. The European
Commission (2005) estimates that a 20% reduction in EU
energy consumption by 2020 can potentially create (directly
or indirectly) as many as one million new jobs in Europe,
especially in the area of semi-skilled labour in the buildings
trades (Jeeninga et al., 1999; European Commission, 2003).

"Additional co-benefits of building-level GHG mitigation
include improved energy security and system reliability (IEA,
2004f), discussed in more detail in Chapter 4. Improving
end-use energy efficiency is among the top priorities on the
European Commission’s agenda to increase energy security,
with the recognition that energy efficiency is likely to generate
additional macro-economic benefits because reduced energy
imports will improve the trade balances of importing countries
(European Commission, 2003).

"Fuel poverty, or the inability to afford basic energy services
to meet minimal needs or comfort standards, is also found in
even the wealthiest countries. In the UK in 1996, about 20%
of all households were estimated to live in fuel poverty. The
number of annual excess winter deaths, estimated by the
UK Department of Health at around 30 thousand annually
between 1997 and 2005, can largely be attributed to inadequate
heating (Boardman, 1991; DoH (UK Department of Health),
2000). Improving energy efficiency in these homes is a major
component of strategies to eradicate fuel poverty.

"Certain characteristics of markets, technologies and end-users
can inhibit rational, energy-saving choices in building design,
construction and operation, as well as in the purchase and use of
appliances. The Carbon Trust (2005) suggests a classification of
these barriers into four main categories: financial costs/benefits;
hidden costs/benefits; real market failures; and behavioural/
organizational non-optimalities. Table 6.5 gives characteristic
examples of barriers that fall into these four main categories.
The most important among them that pertain to buildings are
discussed below in further detail.

"In developing countries, energy-efficient household
equipment and low-energy building design can contribute to
poverty alleviation through minimizing energy expenditures,
therefore making more energy services affordable for low-
income households (Goldemberg, 2000). Clean and efficient
utilization of locally available renewable energy sources
reduces or replaces the need for energy and fuel purchases,
increasing the access to energy services. Therefore, sustainable
development strategies aimed at improving social welfare go
hand-in-hand with energy efficiency and renewable energy
development.
"	Text
"Improving residential energy efficiency helps households
cope with the burden of paying utility bills and helps them
afford adequate energy services. One study estimated that an
average EU household could save € 200-1000 (US$ 248-
1240) in utility costs through cost-effective improvements in
energy efficiency (European Commission, 2005). Reducing
the economic burden of utility bills is an important co-benefit
of energy efficiency for less affluent households. This is
especially true in former communist countries and others (e.g.,
in Asia and Latin America) where energy subsidies have been
removed and energy expenditures are a major burden for much
of the population (Urge-Vorsatz et al., 2006). In economies
in transition, this situation provides an opportunity to redirect
those social programmes aimed at compensating for increasing
energy costs towards energy-efficiency efforts. In this way
resources can be invested in long-term bill reduction through
energy efficiency instead of one-time subsidies to help pay
current utility bills (Urge-Vorsatz and Miladinova, 2005).
"	Text
"In summary, investments in residential and commercial
building energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies
can yield a wide spectrum of benefits well beyond the value
of saved energy and reduced GHG emissions. Several climate
mitigation studies focusing on the buildings sector maintain that,
ifco-benefits of the various mitigation options are included in the
economic analysis, their economic attractiveness may increase
considerably — along with their priority levels in the view of
decision-makers (Jakob et al., 2002; Mirasgedis et al., 2004;
Banfi et al., 2006). Strategic alliances with other policy fields,
such as employment, competitiveness, health, environment,
social welfare, poverty alleviation and energy security, can
provide broader societal support for climate change mitigation
goals and may improve the economics of climate mitigation
efforts substantially through sharing the costs or enhancing
the dividends (European Commission, 2005). In developing
countries, residential and commercial-sector energy efficiency
and modern technologies to utilize locally available renewable
energy forms, can form essential components of sustainable
development strategies.

in Russia has driven the government to subsidize energy costs

term marginal costs of energy, including direct subsidies to some
customers, hinders the penetration of efficient technologies

"1997; Schleich and Gruber, 2007). Decisions about the energy
features of a building (e.g., whether to install high-efficiency
windows or lighting) are often made by agents not responsible
for the energy bills or not using the equipment, divorcing the
interests of the builder/investor and the occupant. For example,
in many countries the energy bills of hospitals are paid from
central public funds while investment expenditures must come
either from the institution itself or from the local government
(Rezessy et al., 2006). Finally, the prevailing selection criteria
and fee structures for building designers may emphasize
initial costs over life-cycle costs, hindering energy-efficiency
considerations (Lovins, 1992; Jones et al., 2002).

"Misplaced incentives, or the agent-principal barrier
takes place when intermediaries are involved in decisions to
purchase energy-saving technologies, or agents responsible for
investment decisions are different from those benefiting from
the energy savings, for instance due to fragmented institutional
organizational structures. This limits the consumer’s role and
often leads to an under-emphasis on investments in energy
efficiency. For example, in residential buildings, landlords often
provide the AC equipment and major appliances and decide on
building renovation, while the tenant pays the energy bill. As a
result, the landlord is not likely to invest in energy efficiency,
since he or she is not the one rewarded for the investment (Scott,

"Compounding the flaws in the typical design process is
fragmentation in the building industry as a whole. Assuring the
long-term energy performance and sustainability of buildings
is all the more difficult when decisions at each stage of design,
construction and operation involve multiple stakeholders. This
division of responsibilities often contributes to suboptimal
results (e.g., under-investment in energy-efficient approaches
to envelope design because of a failure to capitalize on
opportunities to down-size HVAC equipment). In Switzerland,
this barrier is being addressed by the integration of architects
into the selection and installation of energy-using devices in
buildings (Jefferson, 2000); while the European Directive on
the Energy Performance of Buildings in the EU (see Box 6.3)
aims to bring engineers in at early stages of the design process

it has been estimated to cost utilities billions of dollars each
year (Suriyamongkol, 2002). The failure of recipients to pay in
full for energy services tends to induce waste and discourage
energy efficiency.
"	Text
"A range of regulatory barriers has been shown to stand in
the way of building-level distributed generation technologies
such as PV, reciprocating engines, gas turbines and fuel cells
(Alderfer et al., 2000). In many countries, these barriers
include variations in environmental permitting requirements,
which impose significant burdens on project developers.
Similar variations in metering policies cause confusion in the
marketplace and represent barriers to distributed generation.
Public procurement regulations often inhibit the involvement of
ESCOs or the implementation of energy performance contracts.
Finally, in some countries the rental market is regulated in a way
that discourages investments in general and energy-efficient
investments in particular.
"	Text
"Information about energy-efficiency options is often
incomplete, unavailable, expensive and difficult to obtain or
trust. In addition, few small enterprises in the building industry
have access to sufficient training in new technologies, new
standards, new regulations and best practices. This insufficient
knowledge is compounded by uncertainties associated with
energy price fluctuations (Hassett and Metcalf, 1993). It
is particularly difficult to learn about the performance and
costs of energy-efficient technologies and practices, because
their benefits are often not directly observable. For example,
households typically receive an energy bill that provides no
breakdown of individual end-uses and no information on GHG
emissions, while infrequent meter readings (e.g., once a year, as
is typical in many EU countries) provide insufficient feedback
to consumers on their energy use and on the potential impact
of their efficiency investments. Trading off energy savings
against higher purchase prices for many energy-efficient
products involves comparing the time-discounted value of
the energy savings with the present cost of the equipment — a
calculation that can be difficult for purchasers to understand
and compute.
"	Text
"Another broad category of barriers stems from the cultural
and behavioural characteristics of individuals. The potential
impact of lifestyle and tradition on energy use is most easily seen
by cross-country comparisons. For example, dishwasher usage
was 21% of residential energy use in UK residences in 1998
but 51% in Sweden (European Commission, 2001). Cold water
is traditionally used for clothes washing in China (Biermayer
and Lin, 2004) whereas hot water washing is common in
Europe. Similarly, there are substantial differences among
countries in how lighting is used at night, room temperatures
considered comfortable, preferred temperatures of food or
drink, the operating hours of commercial buildings, the size
and composition of households, ete. IEA, 1997; Chappells and
Shove, 2004). Variation across countries in quantity of energy
used per capita, which is large both at economy and household
levels (IEA, 1997), can be explained only partly by weather and
wealth; this is also appropriately attributed to different lifestyles.
Even in identical houses with the same number of residents,
energy consumption has been shown to differ by a factor of
two or more (Socolow, 1978). Studies aimed at understanding
these issues suggest that while lifestyle, traditions and culture
can act as barriers, retaining and supporting lower-consuming
lifestyles may also be effective in constraining GHG emissions
(e.g., EEA, 2001).
"	Text
"Many energy-efficiency projects and ventures in buildings
are too small to attract the attention of investors and financial
institutions. Small project size, coupled with disproportionately
high transaction costs — these are costs related to verifying
technical information, preparing viable projects and negotiating
and executing contracts — prevent some energy-efficiency
investments. Furthermore, the small share of energy expenditures
in the disposable incomes of affluent population groups, and the
opportunity costs involved with spending the often limited free
time of these groups on finding and implementing the efficient
solutions, severely limits the incentives for improved efficiency
in the residential sector. Similarly, small enterprises often
receive higher returns on their investments into marketing or
other business-related activities than investing their resources,
including human resources, into energy-related activities.
Conservative, asset-based lending practices of financial
institutions, a limited understanding of energy-efficiency
technologies on the part of both lenders and their consumers,
lack of traditions in energy performance contracting, volatile
prices for fuel (and in some markets, electricity), and small,
non-diversified portfolios of energy projects all increase the
perception of market and technology risk (Ostertag, 2003;
Westling, 2003; Vine, 2005). As discussed in Section 6.8 below,
policies can be adopted that can help reduce these transaction
costs, thus improving the economics and financing options for
energy-efficiency investments.

"Energy codes are often considered to be an important driver
for improved energy efficiency in new buildings. However,
the implementation of these codes in practice needs to be well
prepared and to be monitored and verified. Compliance can be

"Preceding sections have demonstrated the high potential for
reducing GHG emissions in buildings through cost-effective
energy-efficiency measures and distributed (renewable) energy
generation technologies. The previous section has demonstrated
that even the cost-effective part of the potential is unlikely to be
captured by markets alone, due to the high number of barriers.
Although there is no quantitative or qualitative evidence in the
literature, it is possible that barriers to the implementation of
economically attractive GHG reduction measures are the most
numerous and strongest in the building sector, especially in
households. Since policies can reduce or eliminate barriers
and associated transaction costs (Brown, 2001), special efforts
targeted at removing the barriers in the buildings sector may be
especially warranted for GHG mitigation efforts.

"Building energy codes may be classified as follows: 1) Overall
performance-based codes that require compliance with an annual
energy consumption level or energy cost budget, calculated
using a standard method. This type of code provides flexibility
but requires well-trained professionals for implementation;
2) Prescriptive codes that set separate performance levels for
major envelope and equipment components, such as minimum
thermal resistance of walls, maximum window heat loss/gain
and minimum boiler efficiency. There are also examples of codes
addressing electricity demand. Several cantons in Switzerland
specify maximum installed electric loads for lighting ventilation
and cooling in new commercial buildings (SIA, 2006); and 3) A
combination of an overall performance requirement plus some
component performance requirements, such as wall insulation
and maximum window area.
"	Text
"Prescriptive codes are often easier to enforce than
performance-based codes (Australian Greenhouse Office, 2000;
City of Fort Collins, 2002; Smith and McCullough, 2001).
However, there is a clear trend in many countries towards
performance-based codes that address the overall energy
consumption of the buildings. This trend reflects the fact that
performance-based policies allow optimization of integrated
design and leave room for the creativity of designers and
innovative technologies. However, successful implementation
of performance-based codes requires education and training
— of both building officials and inspectors — and demonstration
projects showing that the building code can be achieved without
much additional cost and without technical problems (Joosen,
2006). New software-based design and education tools,
including continuous e-learning tools, are examples of tools
that can provide good design techniques, continuous learning
by professionals, easier inspection methods and virtual testing
of new technologies for construction and building systems.

"Due to space limitations, not all barriers to energy efficiency
identified in Table 6.5 can be detailed here. Other important
barriers in the buildings sector include the limited availability
of capital and limited access to capital markets of low-income
households and small businesses, especially in developing
countries (Reddy, 1991); limited availability of energy-efficient
equipment along the retail chain (Brown et al., 1991); the case
of poor power quality in some developing countries interfering
with the operation of the electronics needed for energy efficient
end-use devices (EAP UNDP, 2000); and the inadequate
levels of energy services (e.g., insufficient illumination levels
in schools, or unsafe wiring) in many public buildings in
developing countries and economies in transition. This latter
problem can severely limit the cost-effectiveness of efficiency
investments, since a proposed efficiency upgrade must also
address these issues, offsetting most or all of the energy and
cost savings associated with improved efficiency and in turn
make it difficult to secure financing or pay back a loan from
energy cost savings.

addressing energy efficiency in existing buildings. For
instance, the EU Commission introduced the Directive on the
Energy Performance of Buildings in 2003 (see Box 6.3), which
standardized and strengthened building energy-efficiency
requirements for all EU Member States. To date, most codes
for existing buildings include requirements for minimum levels
of performance of the components used to retrofit building
elements or installations. In some countries, the codes may even
prohibit the use of certain technologies — for example Sweden’s
prohibition of direct electric resistance heating systems, which

"With the introduction of the EU Directive on the Energy
Performance of Buildings (see Box 6.3), building certification

components in North America, the EU and a few other countries
(McMahon and Wiel, 2001; Menanteau, 2001). The voluntary
Energy Star Buildings rating and Energy Star Homes label in
the USA and the NF-MI voluntary certificate for houses in
France have proven to be effective in ensuring compliance with
energy code requirements and sometimes in achieving higher
performance levels (Hicks and Von Neida, 1999). Switzerland
has developed the ‘Minergie’ label for new buildings that
have a 50% lower energy demand than buildings fulfilling
the mandatory requirements; such buildings typically require
roughly 6% additional investment costs (OPET Network, 2004).
Several local governments in Japan apply the Comprehensive

"One of the most advanced and comprehensive pieces of regulation targeted at the improvement of energy efficiency in
buildings is the new European Union Directive on the Energy Performance of Buildings (European Commission, 2002). The
Directive introduces four major actions. The first action is the establishment of ‘common methodology for calculating the
integrated energy performance of buildings’, which may be differentiated at the regional level. The second action is to require
member states to ‘apply the new methods to minimum energy performance standards’ for new buildings. The Directive also
requires that a non-residential building, when it is renovated, be brought to the level of efficiency of new buildings. This lat-
ter requirement is a very important action due to the slow turnover and renovation cycle of buildings, and considering that
major renovations to inefficient older buildings may occur several times before they are finally removed from the stock. This
represents a pioneer effort in energy-efficiency policy; it is one of the few policies worldwide to target existing buildings. The
third action is to set up ‘certification schemes for new and existing buildings’ (both residential and non-residential), and in
the case of public buildings to require the public display of energy performance certificates. These certificates are intended
to address the landlord/tenant barrier, by facilitating the transfer of information on the relative energy performance of build-
ings and apartments. Information from the certification process must be made available for new and existing commercial
buildings and for dwellings when they are constructed, sold, or rented. The last action mandates Member States to establish
‘regular inspection and assessment of boilers and heating/cooling installations’.

create comprehensive, integrated programmes at universities
and other educational establishments to train the future building
professional in the design and construction of low-energy
buildings. The value of such programmes is significantly
enhanced if they have an outreach component to upgrade the
skills and knowledge of practicing professionals — for example,
by assisting in the use of computer simulation tools as part of

"Occasionally with financial support from government or
utility companies, these programmes may provide trained
energy auditors to conduct on-site inspections of buildings,
perform most of the calculations for the building owner and
offer recommendations for energy-efficiency investments
or operational measures, as well as other cost-saving actions
(e.g., reducing peak electrical demand, fuel-switching).
The implementation of the audit recommendations can be
voluntary for the owner, or mandated-such as in the Czech
Republic and Bulgaria, which require that installations with
energy consumption above a certain limit conduct an energy-
efficiency audit and implement the low-cost measures (Urge-
Vorsatz et al., 2003). In India, all large commercial buildings
have to conduct an energy audit at specified intervals of time
(The Energy Conservation Act, 2001). The EU EPB Directive
mandates audits and the display of the resulting certificate in an
increasing number of situations (see Box 6.3).

"The education of end-users and raising their awareness
about energy-efficiency opportunities is also important. Good
explanation (e.g., user-friendly manuals) is often a condition
for proper installation and functioning of energy-efficient
buildings and components. Since optimal operation and
regular maintenance are often as important as the technological
efficiency in determining overall energy consumption of
equipment, accessible information and awareness raising about
these issues during and after purchase are necessary. This need
for widespread education is beginning to be reflected in the
curricula of some countries: Japan’s and Germany’s schools
increasingly teach the importance of energy savings (ECCI,
2006; Hamburger-bildungsserver, 2006). Better education is
also relevant for professionals such as plumbers and electricians.
Incentives for consumers are generally needed along with the

"Standby and low-power-mode (LoPoMo) electricity consumption of appliances is growing dramatically worldwide, while
technologies exist that can eliminate or reduce a significant share of related emissions. The IEA (2001) estimated that standby
power and LoPoMo waste may account for as much as 1% of global CO, emissions and 2.2% of OECD electricity consump-
tion. Lebot et a/. (2000) estimated that the total standby power consumption in an average household could be reduced by
72%, which would result in emission reductions of 49 million tCO, in the OECD. Various instruments — including minimum
energy efficiency performance standards (MEPS), labelling, voluntary agreements, quality marks, incentives, tax rebates and
energy-efficient procurement policies — are applied globally to reduce the standby consumption in buildings (Commission
of the European Communities, 1999), but most of them capture only a small share of this potential. The international expert
community has been urging a 1-Watt target (IEA, 2001). In 2002, the Australian government introduced a ‘one-watt’ plan
aimed at reducing the standby power consumption of individual products to less than one watt. To reach this, the National
Appliance and Equipment Energy Efficiency Committee has introduced a range of voluntary and mandatory measures to
reduce standby — including voluntary labelling, product surveys, MEPS, industry agreements and mandatory labelling (Com-

Since the 1990s, 57 countries have legislated efficiency
standards and/or labels, applied to a total of 46 products as of
2004 (Wiel and McMahon, 2005). Today, S&L programmes are
among the most cost-effective instruments across the economy
to reduce GHG emissions, with typically large negative costs
(see Table 6.6). Products subject to standards or labels cover all
end-uses and fuel types, with a focus on appliances, information

"Despite widely divergent approaches, national S&L
programmes have resulted in significant cost-effective GHG
savings. The US programme of national, mandatory energy-
efficiency standards began in 1978. By 2004, the programme
had developed (and, in 17 cases, updated) standards for
39 residential and commercial products. The total federal
expenditure for implementing the US appliance standards
adopted so far (US$ 2 per household) is estimated to have
induced US$ 1270 per household of net-present-value savings
during the lifetimes of the products affected. Projected annual
residential carbon reductions in 2020 due to these appliance
standards amount roughly to 9% of projected US residential
carbon emissions in the 2020 (base case) (Meyers et al., 2002).

efficiency standards on equipment through its ‘Top Runner
Programme’ by distinctly setting the target values based on the
most energy-efficient model on the market at the time of the
value-setting process. Energy-efficiency values and a rating
mark are voluntarily displayed in promotional materials so that
consumers can consider energy-efficiency when purchasing

consumers of the product’s relative or absolute performance

evaluating the effectiveness of labels (Thorne and Egan, 2002),
those that show the annual energy cost savings appear to be
more effective than labels that present life-cycle cost savings.
An advantage of a ‘categorical’ labelling scheme, showing a
number of stars or an A-B-C rating, is that it is often easiest
for consumers to understand and to transfer their understanding
of the categories from one product purchase to others. The
categories also provide a useful framework for implementing
rebates, tax incentives, or preferential public procurement
programmes, while categorical labels on HVAC and other
installed equipment make it easy for the building inspector to
check for code compliance. A downside ofa categorical labelling
system can be that if standards are not revised from time to
time, there is no stimulus to the manufacturers to develop more
efficient appliances and the whole market will be able to deliver
appliances fitting the highest efficiency class.

"Market-based energy pricing and energy taxes represent
a broad measure for saving energy in buildings. The effect
of energy taxes depends on energy price elasticity, that is the
percent change in energy demand associated with each 1%
change in price. In general, residential energy price elasticities
are low in the richest countries. In the UK, long-run price
elasticity for the household sector is only —0.19 (Eyre, 1998), in
the Netherlands —0.25 (Jeeninga and Boots, 2001) and in Texas
only —0.08 (Bernstein and Griffin, 2005). However, if energy
expenditures reach a significant proportion of disposable
incomes, as in many developing countries and economies in
transition, elasticities — and therefore the expected impact of
taxes and subsidy removal — may be higher, although literature
is sparse on the subject. In Indonesia, price elasticity was —0.57
in the period from 1973 to 1990 and in Pakistan —0.33 (De Vita
et al., 2006). Low elasticity means that taxes on their own have
little impact; it is behavioural and structural barriers that need to
be addressed (Carbon Trust, 2005). To have a significant impact
on CO, emission reduction, excise taxes have to be substantial.
This is only the case in a few countries (Figure 6.6): the share
of excise tax compared to total fuel price differs considerably
by country.

better achieved through other means — e.g., the introduction of

so they favour the efficient and environmentally sound use of

"In stark contrast to imposing energy taxes, energy prices are
subsidized in many countries. This results in under-pricing of
energy, which reduces the incentive to use it more efficiently.
Energy subsidies are also typically much larger, per GJ, in
developing and transition countries than in most industrial
economies (Markandya, 2000). The total value of energy
subsidies of eight of the largest non-OECD countries (China,
Russia, India, Indonesia, Iran, South Africa, Venezuela and
Kazakhstan), covering almost 60% of total non-OECD energy
demand, was around US$ 95 billion in 1998 (UNEP OECD/
IEA, 2002). In 1999, the IEA estimated that removing the
energy subsidies in those eight countries would reduce primary
energy use by 13%, lower CO, emissions by 16% and raise

"There has been limited assessment of the efficiency of these
schemes. The cost-effectiveness of subsidy-type schemes can
vary widely, depending on programme design. Joosen et al.
(2004) have estimated that subsidy programmes for residential

range for the commercial sector was between 64 and 123
US$/tCO,. A variety of financial incentives available
simultaneously may make the decision process difficult;
simplicity of the schemes might be an asset (Barnerjee and
Solomon, 2003). A combination of government financial
incentives and private bank loans may be more effective than a
government-subsidized loan, as may combining building rating
or labelling with a loan-especially when the labelling scheme
has public approval.
"	Text
"While it may be economically and environmentally
desirable, it is a socially sensitive task to remove end-user
subsidies, especially in the residential sector. Since the bulk of
these subsidies are found in countries with low incomes and
high fuel-poverty rates, their removal can cause a substantial
financial burden for families and even institutions. This, in turn,
can lead to bankruptcy, increased payment arrears, energy theft
and generally increased social tensions (ERRA/LGI, 2002;
Urge-Vorsatz et al., 2003), ultimately leading to disincentives
to improve efficiency. Therefore, a drastic subsidy removal
is often accompanied by social compensation programmes.
One potentially important form of alternative compensation —
although not frequently used to date—is assistance to low-income
households to invest in energy-saving measures that reduce
fuel costs and GHG emissions in the long term as opposed to
direct cash assistance providing short-term relief (ERRA/LGI,
2002). For a number of years, the US government has provided
1.5—2.0 billion US$/yr to help low-income households pay their
energy bills (LIHEAP, 2005), and smaller amounts budgeted
for grants to ‘weatherize’ many of these same households with
efficiency measures that help to permanently reduce monthly
fuel and electricity bills (Schweitzer and Berry, 1999).
"	Text
"Going beyond IDP, other measures — particularly those that
include renewable energy options — entail significant added
capital costs. Many developed countries offer incentives for
such measures (IEA, 2004f). Types of financial support include
subsidies, tax reduction (or tax credit) schemes and preferential
loans or funds, with investment subsidies being the most
frequently used (IEA, 2004f). Capital subsidy programmes and
tax exemption schemes for both new construction and existing
buildings have been introduced in nine OECD countries out of
20 surveyed (OECD, 2003). Several countries (USA, France,
Belgium, UK and the Netherlands) combine their financial
incentive policy for the existing building stock with social
policy to assist low-income households (IEA, 2004a; VROM,
2006; USDOE, 2006). Increasingly, eligibility requirements
for financial support are tied to CO, emission reduction (IEA,
2004a; KfW Group, 2006). Within the Energy Star Homes
programme in the USA, houses that meet the energy-efficiency
standard are eligible for a special mortgage (Nevin and Watson,
1998; Energystar, 2006). Financial incentives for the purchase
of energy-efficient appliances are in place in some countries,
including Mexico, the USA, Belgium, Japan and Greece

"In 2006, the US ESCO market is considered the most

Europe was estimated to be € 150 million/yr in 2000, while the
market potential was estimated at € 5—10 billion/yr (Butson,

"While it is too early to conclude that the Kyoto Protocols’s
project-based mechanisms do not work well for buildings, there
are no indications that this trend will reverse. A number of barriers
prevent these mechanisms from fully mobilizing their benefits
for buildings (Tangen and Heggelund, 2003; ECON Analysis,
2005). Chief among these is the proportionately high transaction
costs due to the relatively small size of building-related projects:
although these costs are around 100 €/tCO, (124 US$/tCO,)
for building-related projects, they amount only to 0.1 €/tCO,
(0.12 US$/tCO,) for very large-scale projects (Michaelowa

suggested to overcome the barriers (Novikova et al., 2006), their
implementation is uncertain. Another major chance opens for
buildings in former communist countries with large emission
surpluses through Green Investment Schemes, or the “greening”
of these surplus emission units, if they are constructed to
accommodate small-scale energy-efficiency investments better

companies, product manufacturers or distributors and large
consumers) to meet specified energy savings or programme-
delivery goals, potentially coupled with a trading system based
on verified and certified savings achieved (or expected) for
energy-efficiency measures (the ‘white’ certificate) (ECEEE,
2004; Oikonomou et al., 2004). Energy efficiency obligation
programmes without certificate trading have been operating
in the UK since 1994 and in Flanders (Belgium) since 2003;
white certificate schemes with a trading element were in place
in 2006 in Italy, France and New South Wales. Other European
countries have announced their intention to introduce similar
schemes.

"The flexibility mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol (KP),
especially the clean development mechanism (CDM) and joint
implementation (JI), could offer major benefits for buildings
in developing countries and economies in transition, in terms
of financing, transfer of advanced technologies and know-
how, building of local capacity and demonstration effects
(Woerdman, 2000; Grubb et a/., 2002). Buildings should be
prime targets for project-based mechanisms due to the variety
and magnitude of cost-effective potentials (see section 6.5). For
instance, Trexler and Associates (Margaree Consultants, 2003)
estimated that building and appliance efficiency accounts for
32% of total potential in CDM in 2010 under 0 US$/tCO, and
20% under 20 US$/tCO,. However, evidence until 2006 shows
that little of this potential is expected to be unlocked during
the first commitment period (Novikova et al., 2006). After
initial enthusiasm in the activities implemented jointly (AIJ)
phase, where 18 out of 156 registered projects were targeted to
buildings, JI and CDM experience to date suggests that this pilot
phase brought disappointment in building-related projects. As
of February 2006, only four CDM projects out of 149 projects
registered or seeking validation were for buildings, and none of
the 152 approved and submitted JI projects was due to invest in
buildings (Novikova et al., 2006).

"Between 1996 and 2003 the annual worldwide RD&D budget
for energy efficiency in buildings has been approximately US$
225-280 million/yr (IEA, 2004d). The USA has been the leading
country in energy research and development for buildings for
over a decade. Despite the decline in US funds by 2/34 between
1993 and 2003, down from a peak of US$ 180 million, the USA
is still responsible for half of the total global expenditures (IEA,
2004d). Substantial buildings-related energy-efficiency RD&D
is also sponsored in Japan (15% of global expenditure).

"The overall share of energy-efficiency in total energy RD&D
expenditure is low, especially compared to its envisioned role
in global GHG mitigation needs. In the period from 2001 to
2005 on average only 14% of all energy RD&D expenditure
in IEA countries has been designated for energy-efficiency
improvement (IEA, 2006c), whereas its contribution to CO,
emission reduction needs by 2050 is 45% according to the
most commonly used ‘Map’ scenario of the IEA (2006d). The
share dedicated to energy efficiency improvements in buildings
was only 3%, in stark contrast with their 18% projected role in

"A number of countries have established legislative and
voluntary regimes to control emissions and use of fluorinated
gases. In Europe, a number of countries have existing policies
that aim at reducing leakage or discouraging the use of
refrigerants containing fluorine. Regulations in the Netherlands
minimize leakage rates through improved maintenance and
regular inspection. Substantial taxes for refrigerants containing
fluorine are levied in Scandinavian countries, and legislation
in Luxembourg requires all new large cooling systems to use
natural refrigerants (Harmelink et a/., 2005). Some countries
such as Denmark and Austria have banned the use of HFCs
in selected air conditioning and refrigeration applications. In
2006 the EU Regulation 842/2006 entered into force, which
requires that all medium and large stationary air conditioning
applications in the EU will use certified and trained service
personnel, and assures recovery of refrigerants at the end-of-
life (Harmelink et al., 2005).
"	Text
"Section 6.4 attested that there is already a broad array of
accessible and cost-effective technologies and know-how that
can abate GHG emissions in existing and new buildings to a
significant extent that have not been widely adopted yet. At the
same time, several recently developed technologies, including
high performance windows, active glazing, vacuum insulated
panels, phase change materials to increase building thermal
mass, high performance reversible heat pumps and many other
technologies may be combined with integrated passive solar
design and result in up to 80% reduction of building energy
consumption and GHG emissions. Large-scale GHG reduction
in buildings requires fast and large-scale dissemination and
transfer in many countries, including efficient and continuous
training of professionals in the integrated approach to design
and optimized use of combinations of technologies. Integrated
intelligent building control systems, building- or community-
level renewable energy generation, heat and coldness networks,
coupled to building renewable energy capture components and
intelligent management of the local energy market need more
research, development and demonstration, and could develop
significantly in the next two decades.

"In the USA, it has been illegal under the Clean Air Act
since 1995, to vent substitutes for CFC and HCFC refrigerants
during maintenance, repair and disposal of air conditioning and
refrigeration equipment (US EPA, 2006). Japan, has established
a target to limit HFC, PFC and SF6 emissions. Measures to
meet this target include voluntary action plans by industries,
mandatory recovery systems for HFCs used as refrigerants
(since April 2002) and the research and development of
alternatives (UNFCCC, 2006). Australia has developed an
Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management
Act. Measures include supply controls though the licensing of
importers, exporters and manufacturers of fluorinated gases
and pre-charged refrigeration and air conditioning equipment;
end-use regulations on handling, use, recovery, sale and
reporting are in place (Australian Government, 2006). Canada
has established a National Action Plan for the Environmental
Control of ODS and their Halocarbon Alternatives (NAP). This
ensures that HFCs are only used in applications where they
replace ODS and requires recovery, recycling and reclamation
for CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs (Canadian Council of Ministers of
the Environment, 2001).

"While the 66 studies represent the majority of such
evaluations available in the public domain in 2006, this sample
still leaves few studies in certain categories. Therefore, the
comparative findings of this assessment should be viewed as
indicative rather than conclusive. Although a general caveat of
comparative policy assessments is that policies act as parts of
portfolios and therefore the impact of an individual instrument
is difficult to delineate from those of other tools, this concern
affects the assessment to a limited extent since the literature
used already completed this disaggregation before evaluating
individual instruments.
"	Text
"Section 6.8 demonstrates that there is a variety of
government policies, programmes, and market mechanisms in
many countries for successfully reducing energy-related CO,
emissions in buildings (high agreement, medium evidence).
Table 6.6 (below) reviews 20 of the most important policy
tools used in buildings according to two criteria from the list of
criteria suggested in Chapter 13 (of the ones for which literature
was available in policy evaluations): emission reduction
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Sixty-six ex post (with a
few exceptions) policy evaluation studies were identified from
over 30 countries and country groups that served as a basis for
the assessment.

"Although there are no international proposals to phase out
the use of HFCs in foams, the high costs of HFCs have naturally
contributed to the minimization of their use in formulations
(often by use with co-blowing agents) and by early replacement
by alternative technologies based primarily on CO), water
or hydrocarbons (e.g. pentane). There is more regulatory
uncertainty at regional level and in Japan some pressure exists
to stop HFC-use in the foam sector. In Europe, the recently
published F-Gas regulation (European Commission, 2006)
only impacts the use of HFCs in one component foam (OCF)
which is used primarily for gap filling in the construction sector.
However, there is a requirement to put in place provisions for
recovery of blowing agent at end-of-life where such provisions
are technically feasible and do not entail disproportionate cost.
"	Text
"All the instruments reviewed can achieve significant energy
and CO, savings; however the costs per tonne of CO, saved
diverge greatly. In our sample, appliance standard, building
code, labelling and tax exemption policies achieved the
highest CO, emission reductions. Appliance standards, energy
efficiency obligations, demand-side management programmes,
public benefit charges and mandatory labelling were among
the most cost-effective policy tools in the sample, all achieving
significant energy savings at negative costs. Investment
subsidies (as opposed to rebates for purchases of energy
efficient appliances) were revealed as the least cost-effective
instrument. Tax reductions for investments in energy efficiency
appeared more effective than taxation. Labelling and voluntary
programmes can lead to large savings at low-costs if they are
combined with other policy instruments. Finally, information
programmes can also achieve significant savings and effectively
accompany most other policy measures.
"	Text
"Within the European Union, Denmark and Austria have
introduced legislation to ban the use of HFC for the production
of several foam types (Cheminfo, 2004). Since 2006 the EU
Regulation 842/2006 on certain Fluorinated Gases limits
emissions and certain uses of fluorinated gases (European
Commission, 2006), banning the use of HFCs in One-Component
Foam from 2008, except where required to meet national safety
standards. Japan has established a target to limit HFC, PFC and
SF6 emissions. Measures to meet this target include voluntary
action plans by industries, improved containment during the
production process, less blowing agent per product, improved
productivity per product and the use of non-fluorocarbon low
GWP alternatives. Australia has developed an act for industries
covered by the Montreal Protocol and extended voluntary
arrangements for non-Montreal Protocol industries. Measures
include supply controls though the licensing of importers,
exporters and manufacturers of HFCs.

"The first column in Table 6.6 identifies the key policy
instruments grouped by four major categories using a typology
synthesized from several sources including Grubb (1991);
Crossley et al. (2000) and Verbruggen and Bongaerts (2003): (i)
control and regulatory mechanisms, (ii) economic and market-
based instruments, (iii) financial instruments and incentives, and
(iv) support and information programmes and voluntary action.
The second column identifies a selection of countries where the
policy instrument is applied2°, Then, the effectiveness in achieving
CO), reduction and cost-effectiveness were rated qualitatively
based on available literature as well as quantitatively based on one
or more selected case studies. Since any instrument can perform
poorly if not designed carefully, or if its implementation and
enforcement are compromised, the qualitative and quantitative
comparisons are based on identified best practices, in order to
demonstrate what impact an instrument can achieve if applied
well. Finally, the table lists special conditions for success, major
strengths and limitations, and co-benefits.

with vulnerability, adaptation and

"Fortunately, there are many potential synergies where
investments in the buildings sector may reduce the overall cost
of climate change-in terms of both mitigation and adaptation.
For instance, if new buildings are constructed, the design can
address both mitigation and adaptation aspects. Among the
most important of these are reduced cooling loads. For instance,
using advanced insulation techniques and passive solar design
"	Text
"In summary, significant CO, and other GHG savings can be
achieved in buildings, often at net benefit to society (in addition
to avoided climate change) and also meeting many other
sustainable development and economic objectives, but this
requires a stronger political commitment and more ambitious
policy-making than today, including careful design of policies
as well as enforcement and regular monitoring.
"	Text
"Vulnerability of energy demand to climate is country- and
region-specific. For instance, a temperature increase of 2°C
is associated with an 11.6% increase in residential per capita
electricity use in Florida, but with a 7.2% decrease in Washington
DC (Sailor, 2001). Increased net energy demand translates into
increased welfare losses. Mansur et al. (2005) found that, for
a 5°C increase in temperature by 2100, the annual welfare loss
in increased energy expenditures is predicted to reach US$ 40
billion for US households.
"	Text
"The effectiveness of economic instruments, information
programmes and regulation can be substantially enhanced if
these are appropriately combined into policy packages that take
advantage of synergistic effects (Ott et al., 2005). A typical
example is the co-ordination of energy audit programmes
with economic instruments, such as energy taxes and capital
subsidy schemes. In addition, ESCOs can flourish when public
procurement legislation accommodates EPCs and includes
ambitious energy-efficiency or renewable energy provisions, or
in the presence of an energy-saving obligation.
"	Text
"There is no single policy instrument that can capture the
entire potential for GHG mitigation. Due to the especially
strong and diverse barriers in the residential and commercial
sectors, overcoming these is only possible through a diverse
portfolio of policy instruments for effective and far-reaching
GHG abatement and for taking advantage of synergistic effects.
Since climate change literacy, awareness of technological,
cultural and behavioural choices and their impacts on emissions
are important preconditions to fully operating policies, these
policy approaches need to go hand in hand with programmes
that increase consumer access to information, awareness and
knowledge (high agreement, medium evidence).
"	Text
"Section 6.8 demonstrates that, during the last decades,
many new policies have been initiated. However, so far only
incremental progress has been achieved by these policies. In
most developed countries, the energy consumption in buildings
is still increasing (IEA, 2004f). Although some of this growth
is offset by increased efficiency of major energy-consuming
appliances, overall consumption continues to increase due to the
growing demand for amenities, such as new electric appliances
and increased comfort. The limited overall impact of policies so
far is due to several factors: (i) slow implementation processes
(e.g., as of 2006, not all European countries are on time with
the implementation of the EU Buildings Directive); (ii) the lack
of regular updating of building codes (requirements of many
policies are often close to common practices, despite the fact
that CO,-neutral construction without major financial sacrifices
is already possible) and appliance standards and labelling;
and (iii) insufficient enforcement. In addition, Section 6.7
demonstrated that barriers in the building sector are numerous;
diverse by region, sector and end-user group, and are especially
strong.
"	Text
"In formulating climate change strategies, mitigation efforts
need to be balanced with those aimed at adaptation. There are
interactions between vulnerability, adaptation and mitigation
in buildings through climatic conditions and energy systems.
As a result of a warming climate, heating energy consumption
will decline, but energy demand for cooling will increase while
at the same time passive cooling techniques will become less
effective. The net impact of these changes on GHG emissions
is related to the available choice of primary energy used and
the efficiency of technologies that are used for heating and
cooling needs. Mansur et al. (2005) find that the combination
of climate warming and fuel switching in US buildings from
fuels to electricity results in increases in the overall energy
demand, especially electricity. Other studies indicate that in
European countries with moderate climate the increase in
electricity for additional cooling is higher than the decrease for
heating demand in winter (Levermore et al., 2004; Aebischer
et al., 2006; Mirasgedis et al., 2006). Aebischer et al. (2006)
finds that in Europe there is likely to be a net increase in power
demand in all but the most northerly countries, and in the south
a significant increase in summer peak demand is expected.
Depending on the generation mix in particular countries, the
net effect on carbon dioxide emissions may be an increase even
where overall demand for final energy declines. Since in many
countries electricity generation is largely based on fossil fuels,
the resulting net difference between heating reduction and
cooling increases may significantly increase the total amount
of GHG emissions. This causes a positive feedback loop: more
mechanical cooling emits more GHGs, thereby exacerbating
warming, although the effect maybe moderate.

these warmer offices.

"Fortunately, buildings offer perhaps the largest portfolio
of options where such synergies can be identified. Matrices in
Chapter 12 demonstrate that the impact of mitigation options
in the building sector on sustainable development, for both
industrialized countries and developing countries, is reported to
be positive for all of the criteria used. Both Sections 6.6 above
and Box 6.1 discuss many of the opportunities for positive
synergies in detail; the next paragraph revisits a few of them.
"	Text
"In 2005, a survey of 562 respondents by the MOE (Murakami et a/., 2006) showed that 96% of the respondents were aware
of ‘Cool Biz’ and 33% answered that their offices set the thermostat higher than in previous years. Based on this result, CO,
emissions were reduced by approximately 460,000 tonnes in 2005, which is equivalent to the amount of CO, emitted from
about one million Japanese households for one month. MOE will continue to encourage offices to set air conditioning in of-
fices at 28°C and will continue to promote ‘Cool Biz.’
"	Text
"to reduce the expected increase in air conditioning load. In
addition, if high-efficiency electric appliances are used, the
savings are increased due to reduced electricity demand for
air conditioning, especially in commercial buildings. Roof
retrofits can incorporate increased insulation and storm security
in one investment. In addition, the integrated design of well-
insulated, air-tight buildings, with efficient air management and
energy systems, leads not only to lower GHG emissions, but
also to reduced thermal stress to occupants, reducing extreme
weather-related mortality and other health effects. Furthermore,
adaptive comfort, where occupants accept higher indoor
(comfort) temperatures when the outside temperature is high,
is now incorporated in design considerations, especially for
predominantly naturally ventilated buildings (see Box 6.5).

"address the core needs of such countries — these are economic
growth, poverty alleviation and employment creation (OECD,
2001). Often a tension exists between the main agenda of most
of these countries (poverty alleviation through increased access
to energy) and climate change concerns. Increased access
to modern energy for the mostly rural population has been a
priority in recent years. Most countries, therefore, place more
policy emphasis on increasing the supply of petroleum and
electricity than on renewables or energy efficiency (Karakezi
and Ranja, 2002). The success of climate change mitigation
policies depends largely on the positive management of these
tensions. GHG reduction strategies in developing countries have
a higher chance of success if they are ‘embedded’ in poverty
eradication efforts, rather than executed independently.
"	Text
"The dual challenges of climate change and sustainable
development were strongly emphasised in the 2002 Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs). GHG mitigation strategies are
more realizable if they work mutually with MDGs towards
the realization of these set objectives. For example, MDG
goal seven is to ensure sustainable development, in part by
reducing the proportion of people using solid fuels which will
lead to the reduction of indoor air pollution (see sections 6.6.1).
GHG mitigation and public health are co-benefactors in the
achievement of this goal. Similarly, increased energy efficiency
in buildings, or considering energy efficiency as the guiding
principle during the construction of new homes, will result
in both reduced energy bills — enhancing the affordability of
increased energy services — and GHG abatement. If technologies
that utilise locally available renewable resources in an efficient
and clean way are used broadly, this provides access to ‘free’
"	Text
"Policies that actively promote integrated building solutions
for both mitigating and adapting to climate change are especially
important for the buildings sector. It has been observed that
building users responding to a warmer climate generally choose
options that increase cooling energy consumption rather than
other means, such as insulation, shading, or ventilation, which
consume less energy. A prime example of this is the tendency
of occupants of existing, poorly performing buildings (mainly
in developing countries) to buy portable air conditioning units.
These trends — which clearly will accelerate in warmer summers
to come — may result in a significant increase of GHG emissions
from the sector, enhancing the positive feedback process.
However, well-designed policies supporting less energy-
intensive cooling alternatives can help combat these trends (see
Box 6.5 and Section 6.4.4.1). Good urban planning, including
increasing green areas as well as cool roofs in cities, has proven
to be an efficient way to limit the heat island effect, which also
aggravates the increased cooling needs (Sailor, 2002).

"Finally, literature on energy price elasticities in the residential

while essential for the design of any policies influencing energy

"	Text
"However, for the poorest people in both developing countries
and industrialised countries, the main barrier to energy-efficiency
and renewable energy investments is the availability of financing
for the investments. Devoting international aid or other public
and private funds aimed at sustainable development to energy
efficiency and renewable energy initiatives in buildings can
achieve a multitude of development objectives and result in a
long-lasting impact. These investments need not necessarily
be executed through public subsidies, but may increasingly be
achieved through innovative financing schemes, such as ESCOs
or public-private partnerships. These schemes offer win-win
opportunities, and leverage and strengthen markets (Blair et al.,
2005).

"With a few exceptions, energy policies and practices in
residential and commercial buildings in sub-Saharan Africa
(SSA) do not take efficiency into consideration. However,
energy efficiency in buildings has recently been recognised as
one of the ways of increasing energy security and benefiting
the environment, through energy savings (Winkler et al., 2002).
South Africa, for example, has drafted an energy-efficiency
strategy to promote efficiency in buildings (DME, 2004).
Such policies can be promoted in other SSA countries by
linking energy efficiency in buildings directly to the countries”
development agendas, by demonstrating how energy efficiency
practises contribute to energy security. The positive impacts
of these practices, including GHG mitigation, could then be
considered as co-benefits.
"	Text
"During the review of the global literature, a few important
areas have been identified which are not adequately researched
or documented. First, there is a critical lack of literature and
data about GHG emissions and mitigation options in developing
countries. Whereas the situation is somewhat better in developed
regions, in the vast majority of countries detailed end-use data
is poorly collected or reported publicly, making analyses and
policy recommendations insufficiently robust. Furthermore,
there is a severe lack of robust, comprehensive, detailed and up-
to-date bottom-up assessments of GHG reduction opportunities
and associated costs in buildings worldwide, preferably using a
harmonized methodology for analysis. In existing assessments
of mitigation options, co-benefits are typically not included, and
in general, there is an important need to quantify and monetize
these so that they can be integrated into policy decision
frameworks. Moreover, there is a critical lack of understanding,
characterisation and taxonomization of non-technological
options to reduce GHG emissions. These are rarely included
in global GHG mitigation assessment models, potentially
largely underestimating overall potentials. However, our policy
leverage to realise these options is also poorly understood.

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

 
"	Title
"Many options exist for mitigating GHG emissions from
the industrial sector (high agreement, much evidence). These
options can be divided into three categories:
"	Text
"Industrial sector emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs)
include carbon dioxide (CO;) from energy use, from non-
energy uses of fossil fuels and from non-fossil fuel sources
(e.g., cement manufacture); as well as non-CO, gases.
"	Text
"Key uncertainties in the projection of mitigation potential
and cost in 2030 are the rate of technology development and
diffusion, the cost of future technology, future energy and
carbon prices, the level of industry activity in 2030, and climate
and non-climate policy drivers. Key gaps in knowledge are the
base case energy intensity for specific industries, especially in
economies-in-transition, and consumer preferences.
"	Text
"Full use of available mitigation options is not being made in
either industrialized or developing nations. In many areas of the
world, GHG mitigation is not demanded by either the market or
government regulations. In these areas, companies will invest
in GHG mitigation if other factors provide a return on their
investment. This return can be economic, for example energy
efficiency projects that provide an economic payout, or it can
be in terms of achieving larger corporate goals, for example
a commitment to sustainable development. The slow rate of
capital stock turnover is also a barrier in many industries, as
is the lack of the financial and technical resources needed to
implement mitigation options, and limitations in the ability of

"Mitigation potential and cost in 2030 have been estimated
through an industry-by-industry assessment for energy-intensive
industries and an overall assessment for other industries. The
approach yielded mitigation potentials at a cost of <100 US$/
tCO,-eq (<370 US$/tC-eq) of 2.0 to 5.1 GtCO,-eq/yr (0.6 to
1.4 GtC-eq/yr) under the B2 scenario!. The largest mitigation
potentials are located in the steel, cement, and pulp and paper
industries and in the control of non-CO, gases. Much of the
potential is available at <50 US$/tCO,-eq (<180 US$/tC-eq).
Application of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology
offers a large additional potential, albeit at higher cost (medium
agreement, medium evidence).
"	Text
"Sector-wide options, for example more efficient electric
motors and motor-driven systems; high efficiency boilers
and process heaters; fuel switching, including the use of
waste materials; and recycling.

Process-specific options, for example the use of the bio-
energy contained in food and pulp and paper industry wastes,
turbines to recover the energy contained in pressurized
blast furnace gas, and control strategies to minimize PFC
emissions from aluminium manufacture.

Operating procedures, for example control of steam and
compressed air leaks, reduction of air leaks into furnaces,
optimum use of insulation, and optimization of equipment
size to ensure high capacity utilization.

"Approximately 85% of the industrial sector’s energy use in
2004 was in the energy-intensive industries: iron and steel, non-
ferrous metals, chemicals and fertilizers, petroleum refining,
minerals (cement, lime, glass and ceramics) and pulp and paper.
In 2003, developing countries accounted for 42% of iron and
steel production, 57% of nitrogen fertilizer production, 78%
of cement manufacture and about 50% of primary aluminium
production. Many industrial facilities in developing nations
are new and include the latest technology with the lowest
specific energy use. However, many older, inefficient facilities
remain in both industrialized and developing countries. In
developing countries, there continues to be a huge demand for
technology transfer to upgrade industrial facilities to improve
energy efficiency and reduce emissions (high agreement, much
evidence).
"	Text
"Energy-related CO, emissions (including emissions from
electricity use) from the industrial sector grew from 6.0
GtCO, (1.6 GtC) in 1971 to 9.9 GtCO, (2.7 GtC) in 2004.
Direct CO, emissions totalled 5.1 Gt (1.4 GtC), the balance
being indirect emissions associated with the generation of
electricity and other energy carriers. However, since energy
use in other sectors grew faster, the industrial sector’s share
of global primary energy use declined from 40% in 1971
to 37% in 2004. In 2004, developed nations accounted for
35%; transition economies 11%; and developing nations
53% of industrial sector energy-related CO, emissions.
CO, emissions from non-energy uses of fossil fuels and
from non-fossil fuel sources were estimated at 1.7 Gt (0.46
GtC) in 2000.

Non-CO, GHGs include: HFC-23 from HCFC-22
manufacture, PFCs from aluminium smelting and
semiconductor processing, SF, from use in electrical
switchgear and magnesium processing and CH, and N,O
from the chemical and food industries. Total emissions from
these sources (excluding the food industry, due to lack of
data) decreased from 470 MtCO,-eq (130 MtC-eq) in 1990
to 430 MtCO,-eq (120 MtC-eq) in 2000.

"While existing technologies can significantly reduce
industrial GHG emissions, new and lower-cost technologies will
be needed to meet long-term mitigation objectives. Examples of
new technologies include: development of an inert electrode to
eliminate process emissions from aluminium manufacture; use
of carbon capture and storage in the ammonia, cement and steel
industries; and use of hydrogen to reduce iron and non-ferrous
metal ores (medium agreement, medium evidence).
"	Text
"Industry GHG investment decisions, many of which have
long-term consequences, will continue to be driven by consumer
preferences, costs, competitiveness and government regulation.
A policy environment that encourages the implementation of
existing and new mitigation technologies could lead to lower
GHG emissions. Policy portfolios that reduce the barriers to the
adoption of cost-effective, low-GHG-emission technology can
be effective (medium agreement, medium evidence).
"	Text
"Both the public and the private sectors have important
roles in the development of low-GHG-emission technologies
that will be needed to meet long-term mitigation objectives.
Governments are often more willing than companies to fund
the higher risk, earlier stages of the R&D process, while
companies should assume the risks associated with actual
commercialisation. The Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development
Mechanism (CDM) and Joint Implementation (JI), and a variety
of bilateral and multilateral programmes, have the deployment,
transfer and diffusion of mitigation technology as one of their
goals (high agreement, much evidence).

"Achieving sustainable development will require the
implementation of cleaner production processes without
compromising employment potential. Large companies have
greater resources, and usually more incentives, to factor
environmental and social considerations into their operations
than small and medium enterprises (SMEs), but SMEs provide
the bulk of employment and manufacturing capacity in many
developing countries. Integrating SME development strategy
into the broader national strategies for development is consistent
with sustainable development objectives (high agreement, much
evidence).

"Industry is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change,
particularly to the impacts of extreme weather. Companies
can adapt to these potential impacts by designing facilities
that are resistant to projected changes in weather and climate,
relocating plants to less vulnerable locations, and diversifying
raw material sources, especially agricultural or forestry
inputs. Industry is also vulnerable to the impacts of changes in
consumer preference and government regulation in response to
the threat of climate change. Companies can respond to these by
mitigating their own emissions and developing lower-emission
products (high agreement, much evidence).
"	Text
"Voluntary agreements between industry and government to
reduce energy use and GHG emissions have been used since
the early 1990s. Well-designed agreements, which set realistic
targets, include sufficient government support, often as part of
a larger environmental policy package, and include a real threat
of increased government regulation or energy/GHG taxes if
targets are not achieved, can provide more than business-as-
usual energy savings or emission reductions. Some voluntary
actions by industry, which involve commitments by individual
companies or groups of companies, have achieved substantial
emission reductions. Both voluntary agreements and actions also
serve to change attitudes, increase awareness, lower barriers to
innovation and technology adoption, and facilitate co-operation
with stakeholders (medium agreement, much evidence).

directly by industry for heat and power generation or indirectly
in the generation of purchased electricity and steam; (2) non-

"Globally, large enterprises dominate these industries.
However, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are
important in developing nations. For example, in India, SMEs
have significant shares in the metals, chemicals, food and pulp
and paper industries (GOI, 2005). There are 39.8 million SMEs
in China, accounting for 99% of the country’s enterprises, 50%
of asset value, 60% of turnover, 60% of exports and 75% of
employment (APEC, 2002). While regulations are moving large
industrial enterprises towards the use of environmentally sound
technology, SMEs may not have the economic or technical
capacity to install the necessary control equipment (Chaudhuri
and Gupta, 2003; Gupta, 2002) or are slower to innovate
(Swamidass, 2003). These SME limitations create special
challenges for efforts to mitigate GHG emissions. However,
innovative R&D for SMEs is also taking place for this sector
(See Section 7.7).

Primary energy associated with electricity and heat consumption was calculated by multiplying the amount of elec-tricity and heat consumed by each end-use sector by
eletricity and heat primary factors. Primary factors were derived as the ratio of fuel inputs at power plants to electricity or heat delivered. Fuel inputs for electricity production
were separated from inputs to heat production, with fuel inputs in combined heat and power plants being separated into fuel inputs for electricity and heat production according
to the shares of electricity and heat produced in these plants. In order to calculate primary energy for non-fossil fuel (hydro, nuclear, renewables), we followed the direct

equivalent method (SRES method): the primary energy of the non-fossil fuel energy is accounted for at the level of secondary energy, that is, the first usable energy form or
“currency” available to the energy system (IPCC, 2000b).

in refineries and other energy conversion operations, power plants, coal transformation plants, etc. However, this energy is included in ‘primary energy’. Upstream
energy consumption was reallocated by weighting electricity, petroleum and coal products consumption with primary factors reflecting energy use and loses in energy
industries. Final energy includes feedstock energy consumed, for example in the chemical industry. ‘CO, emissions’ in this table are higher than in IEA’s Manufacturing
Industries and Construction category because they include upstream COs emissions allocated to the consumption of secondary energy products, such as electricity

sometimes incorporate the latest technology and have the lowest
specific emission rates (BEE, 2006; IEA, 2006c). This has been
demonstrated in the aluminium (Navarro et al., 2003), cement
(BEE, 2003), fertilizer (Swaminathan and Sukalac, 2004) and
steel industries (Tata Steel, Ltd., 2005). However, due to the
continuing need to upgrade existing facilities, there is a huge
demand for technology transfer (hardware, software and know-

multilateral trade system, foreign buyers, insurance companies,

in conflict with pressures for economic growth and increased
employment, for example in China, where the government’s

both large enterprises (Rock, 2005) and capable SMEs the
opportunity to insert themselves into global value chains through
subcontracting linkages, while at the same time increasing
competitive pressure on other enterprises, which could lose
their existing markets. Against this backdrop, SMEs, SME
associations, support institutions, and governments in transition
and developing countries face the challenge of adopting new
approaches and fostering SME competitiveness. Integration of
SME development strategy in the broader national strategies

various companies (API, 2005). The GHG emissions reduction

ensuring fair competition, and companies must develop their
own procedures for using the information generated through
these programmes. The petroleum industry has the longest
experience with energy efficiency benchmarking through the use

cement, chemical and pulp and paper) have developed specific
calculation tools to implement the Protocol. Other calculation

"Even when energy is a significant cost for an industry,
opportunities for improvement may be missed because
of organizational barriers. Energy audit and management
programmes create a foundation for improvement and provide
guidance for managing energy throughout an organization.
Several countries have instituted voluntary corporate energy
management standards, for example Canada (Natural
Resources Canada, n.d.), Denmark (Gudbjerg, 2005) and
the USA (ANSI, 2005). Others, for example India, through
the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (GOI 2004, 2005), promote
energy audits. Integration of energy management systems into
broader industrial management systems, allowing energy use to
be managed for continuous improvement in the same manner as
labour, waste and other inputs are managed, is highly beneficial
(McKane ef al., 2005). Documentation of existing practices
and planned improvements is essential to achieving a transition
from energy efficiency programmes and projects dependent
on individuals to processes and practices that are part of the
corporate culture. Software tools are available to help identify
energy saving opportunities (US DOE, n.d.-a; US EPA, n.d.).

application of industry-wide technologies and measures can

energy savings of 10-20%. Low-cost/minor capital measures
(combustion efficiency optimisation, recovery and use of
exhaust gases, use of correctly sized, high efficiency electric
motors and insulation, etc.) show energy savings of 20-30%.
Higher capital expenditure measures (automatic combustion
control, improved design features for optimisation of piping

"Several governments have supported the development of
benchmarking programmes in various forms, for example
Canada, Flanders (Belgium), the Netherlands, Norway and
the USA. As part of its energy and climate policy the Dutch
government has reached an agreement with its energy-
intensive industry that is explicitly based on industry’s energy
efficiency performance relative to that of comparable industries
worldwide. Industry is required to achieve world best practice
in terms of energy efficiency. In return, the government refrains
from implementing additional climate policies. By 2002 this
programme involved companies using 94% of the energy
consumed by industry in the Netherlands. Phylipsen ef al.
(2002) critiqued the agreement, and conclude that it would avoid
emissions of 4 to 9 MtCO, (1.1 to 2.5 MtC) in 2012 compared to
a business-as-usual scenario, but that these emission reductions
were smaller than those that would be achieved by a continuation
of the Long-Term Agreements with industry (which ended in
2000) that called for a 2%/yr improvement in energy efficiency.
The Flemish covenant, agreed in 2002, uses a similar approach.
As of | January 2005, 177 companies had joined the covenant,
which projects cumulative emissions saving of 2.45 MtCO,
(0.67 MtC) in 2012 (Government of Flanders, 2005).

"Electric motor driven systems provide a large potential for
improvement of industry-wide energy efficiency. De Keulenaer
et al., (2004) report that motor-driven systems account for
approximately 65% of the electricity consumed by EU-25
industry. Xenergy (1998) gave similar figures for the USA,
where motor-driven systems account for 63% of industrial
electricity use. The efficiency of motor-driven systems can
be increased by improving the efficiency of the electric motor
through reducing losses in the motor windings, using better
magnetic steel, improving the aerodynamics of the motor and
improving manufacturing tolerances. However, the motor is
only one part of the system, and maximizing efficiency requires
properly sizing of all components, improving the efficiency of
the end-use devices (pumps, fans, etc.), reducing electrical and
mechanical transmission losses, and the use of proper operation
and maintenance procedures. Implementing high-efficiency
motor driven systems, or improving existing ones, in the EU-25
could save about 30% of the energy consumption, up to 202
TWh/yr, and avoid emissions of up to 100 MtCO,/yr (27.2
MtC/yr) (De Keulenaer et a/., 2004). In the USA, use of more
efficient electric motor systems could save over 100 TWh/yr
by 2010, and avoid emissions of 90 MtCO,/yr (24.5 MtC/yr)
(Xenergy, 1998). A study of the use of variable speed drives in
selected African food processing plants, petroleum refineries,
and municipal utility companies with a total motor capacity of
70,000 kW resulted in a potential saving of 100 ktCO,-eq/yr
(27 ktC/yr), or between 30-40%, at an internal rate of return
of 40% (CEEEZ, 2003). IEA (2006b) estimates the global
potential to be >20—25%, but a number of barriers have limited

system in a 400 t/hour sugar factory could provide a potential
surplus of 40 MW of zero-carbon electricity, saving 400 ktCO,/
yr (Yamba and Matsika, 2003). Similar technology installed at

However, in practice, average efficiencies are often much lower.
Efficiency measures exist for both boilers and distribution
systems. Besides general maintenance, these include improved
insulation, combustion controls and leak repair in the boiler,
improved steam traps and condensate recovery. Studies in
the USA identified energy-efficiency opportunities with
economically attractive potentials up to 18-20% (Einstein et

"Waste materials (tyres, plastics, used oils and solvents and
sewerage sludge) are being used by a number of industries. Even
though many of these materials are derived from fossil fuels,
they can reduce CO, emissions compared to an alternative in
which they were landfilled or burned without energy recovery.
The steel industry has developed technology to use wastes
such as plastics (Ziebek and Stanek, 2001) as alternative fuel
and feedstock’s. Pretreated plastic wastes have been recycled
in coke ovens and blast furnaces (Okuwaki, 2004), reducing
CO, emissions by reducing both emissions from incineration
and the demand for fossil fuels. In Japan, use of plastics wastes
in steel has resulted in a net emissions reduction of 0.6 MtCO,-
eq/yr (Okazaki et al., 2004). Incineration of wastes (e.g., tyres,
municipal and hazardous waste) in cement kilns is one of the
most efficient methods of disposing of these materials (Cordi
and Lombardi, 2004; Houillon and Jolliet, 2005). Heidelberg
Cement (2006) reported using 78% waste materials (tyres,
animal meal and grease, and sewerage sludge) as fuel for one of
its cement kilns. The cement industry, particularly in Japan, is
investing to allow the use of municipal waste as fuel (Morimoto
et al., 2006). Cement companies in India are using non-fossil
fuels, including agricultural wastes, sewage, domestic refuse
and used tyres, as well as wide range of waste solvents and
other organic liquids; coupled with improved burners and
burning systems (Jain, 2005).

the use of pressure recovery turbines instead of pressure relief

The African Rural Energy Enterprise Development initiative is

The pulp and paper industry uses biomass for much of its energy

sugar industry uses bagasse and the edible oils industry uses
byproduct wastes to generate steam and/or electricity (See
Section 7.4.7.). The use of bagasse for energy is likely to grow as
more becomes available as a byproduct of sugar-based ethanol
production (Kaltner et a/., 2005). When economically attractive,
other industries use biomass fuels, for example charcoal in blast

will reduce CO, emissions, but will only achieve zero net CO,

"While there is a significant potential for heat recovery in
most industrial facilities, it is important to design heat recovery

improvement. Typically, cost-effective energy savings of 5
to 40% are found in process integration analyses in almost
all industries (Martin et a/., 2000; IEA-IETS, n.d.). The wide

Martin e¢ al. (2000) estimated the potential fuel savings from

from used products and sources outside the aluminium industry
now constitutes 33% of world supply and is forecast to rise to
40% by 2025 (IAI, 2006b, Martcheck, 2006). Recycling is also
an important energy saving factor in other non-ferrous metal
industries, as well as the glass and plastics industries (GOI,

and externally in the waste management sector (See Section

now account for 57% of nitrogen fertilizer production (IFA,

determined by feedstock (natural gas compared with heavier
hydrocarbons) and the age and size of the ammonia plant (PSI,
2004, Phylipsen et a/., 2002). National and regional averages
are strongly influenced by whether the sector has undergone
restructuring, which tends to drive less efficient producers out
of the market (Sukalac, 2005). Ammonia plants that use natural
gas as a feed-stock have an energy efficiency advantage over
plants that use heavier feedstock’s and a high percentage of
global ammonia capacity already is based on natural gas. China
is an exception in that 67% of its ammonia production is based
on coal (CESP, 2004) and small-scale plants account for 90%

of the energy is used for separation of the ethylene product,

Up to 15% total energy can be saved by improved separation

improved steam cracking (Ren et al., 2006). Processes have
been developed for converting methane in natural gas to olefins

to meet regulatory requirements. By 2020, global emission
from the manufacture of adipic acid and from the manufacture
of nitric acid are projected to grow to 177 MtCO,-eq (48 MtC-

emissions in both 2000 and 2020 (US EPA, 2006b). Experience
in the USA, Japan and the EU shows that thermal destruction
can eliminate 96% of the N,O emitted from an adipic acid plant.
Catalytic reduction can eliminate 89% of the N,O emitted from
a typical nitric plant in a developed country (US EPA, 2006a).
Mitigation potential at nitric acid plants can range from 70%
to almost 100% depending on the catalyst and plant operating

small-scale kilns used by cottage industries and artisans (FAO,

an estimated 5.17 MtCO,-eq (1.4 MtC-eq) from open-ponding

"Because of increased use of biomass and energy efficiency
improvements, the GHG emissions from the pulp and paper
industry have been reduced over time. Since 1990, CO,
emission intensity of the European paper industry has decreased
by approximately 25% (WBCSD, 2005), the Australian pulp

pulp and paper industry over 40% (FPAC, n.d.). Fossil fuel use
by the US pulp and paper industry declined by more than 50%
between 1972 and 2002 (AF&PA, 2004). However, despite
these improvements, Martin et al. (2000) found a technical
potential for GHG reduction of 25% and a cost-effective
potential of 14% through widespread adoption of 45 energy-

industry. Mllersten et al. (2003) found that CO, emissions
from the Swedish pulp and paper industry could be reduced by
0.5 to 5.0 MtCO,/yr (0.14 to 1.4 MtC/yr) at negative cost using
commercially available technologies, primarily by generating
more biomass-based electricity to displace carbon-intensive
electricity from the grid. The large variation in the results
reflected varying assumptions about the carbon intensity of
displaced electricity and the impacts of ‘industrial valuation’
compared with ‘societal valuation’ of capital. Inter-country
comparisons of energy-intensity in the mid-1990s suggest
that fuel consumption by the pulp and paper industry could be
reduced by 20% or more in a number of countries by adopting

industry, but can reduce both energy consumption and CO,
emissions during cement production by about 40%. Depending
on the concrete application, slag content can be as high as 60% of

aluminium, magnesium, plastics and composites) often require
more energy to produce than the heavier materials they replace,
but their use in vehicles will reduce transport sector energy use,

optimistic ABARE scenario, industrial sector emissions across

7.4.3.2, the fertilizer industry uses nearly half of the CO, it generates for the
production of urea and nitrophosphates. The remaining CO, is suitable for
storage. IPCC (2005a) indicates that it should be possible to store essentially
all of this remaining CO, at a cost of <20 US$/t.

US refineries use about 4% of their energy input to manufacture hydrogen
(Worrell and Galitsky, 2005). Refinery hydrogen production is expected to
increase as crude slates become heavier and the demand for clean products
increases. We assume that in 2030, 5% of refinery energy use worldwide will
be used for hydrogen production, and that the byproduct CO, will be suitable
for carbon storage.

Due to gaps in quantitative information (see the text) the column sums in this

total may not equal sum of regions due to independent rounding.

The mitigation potential of the main industries include electricity savings. To
prevent double counting with the energy supply sector, these are shown sepa-

Mitigation potential for other industries includes only reductions for reduced
electricity use for motors. Limited data in the literature did not allow estimation

In these areas, companies will invest in GHG mitigation to the
extent that other factors provide a return for their investments.
This return can be economic, for example energy-efficiency
improvements that show an economic payout. Nicholson
(2004) reported that the projects BP undertook to lower its CO,
emissions by 10% increased shareholder value by US$ 650

and other GHG mitigation technologies can provide attractive
rates of return, but they tend to increase initial capital costs,
which can be a barrier in locations where capital is limited. If
the technology involved is new to the market in question, even
if it is well-demonstrated elsewhere, the problem of raising
capital may be further exacerbated (Shashank, 2004). Provision
of funding for demonstration of the technology can overcome

"The rate of technology transfer is another factor limiting
the adoption of mitigation technologies. As documented in the
IPCC Special Report Methodological and Technological Issues
in Technology Transfer (IPCC, 2000c), lack of an enabling
environment is a barrier to technology transfer in some countries.
Even when an enabling environment is present, the ability of
industrial organizations to access and absorb information on
technologies is limited. Access to information tends to be more
of a problem in developing nations, but all companies, even
the largest, have limited technical resources to interpret and
translate the available information. The success of programmes
such as US DOE’s Industrial Technologies Programs (ITP) and
of the voluntary information sharing programmes discussed in
Section 7.9.2 is evidence of the pervasiveness of this barrier.

"The slow rate of capital stock turnover in many of the industries
covered in this chapter is a barrier to mitigation (Worrell and
Biermans, 2005). Excess capacity, as exists in some industries,
can further slow capital stock turnover. Policies that encourage
capital stock turnover, such as Japan’s programme to subsidize
the installation of new high performance furnaces (WEC,
2001), will increase GHG mitigation. Companies must also
take into consideration the risks involved with adopting a new
technology, the payback period of a technology, the appropriate
discount rate and transaction costs. Newer, relatively expensive
technologies often have longer payback periods and represent a
greater risk. Reliability is a key concern of industry, making new
technologies less attractive (Rosenberg, 1999). Discount rates
vary substantially across industries and little information exists
on transaction costs of mitigation options (US EPA, 2003).

7.7 Sustainable Development (SD)
implications of industrial GHG
mitigation

 
 
"	Title
"GHG emissions mitigation policies induce increased
innovation that can reduce the energy and capital intensity of
industry. However, this could come at the expense of other,
even more valuable, productivity-enhancing investments or
learning-by-doing efforts (Goulder and Schneider, 1999). If
policies are successful in stimulating economic activity, they are
also likely to stimulate increased energy use. GHG emissions
would increase unless policies decreased the carbon-intensity
of economic activity by more than the increase in activity.
"	Text
"McKane et al. (2005) provide a case study of the interaction
of some of these elements in their analysis of the barriers to the
adoption of energy-efficient electric motors and motor-systems.
These include: (1) industrial markets that focus on components,
not systems; (2) energy efficiency not being a core mission
for most industries, which results in a lack of internal support
systems for mitigation goals; and (3) lack of technical skills to
optimize the systems to the specific application — one size does
not fit all. They found industrial energy efficiency standards a
useful tool in overcoming these barriers.
"	Text
"Although there is no universally accepted, practical definition
of SD, the concept has evolved as the integration of economic,
social and environmental aims (IPCC, 2000a; Munasinghe,
2002). Companies worldwide adopted Triple Bottom Line
(financial, environmental and social responsibility) reporting in
the late 1990’s. The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI, n.d.), a
multi-stakeholder process, has enabled business organizations to
account for and better explain their contributions to sustainable
development. Companies are also reporting under Sigma
Guidelines (The Sigma Project, 2003a), and AA1000 (The
Sigma Project, 2003b) and SA 8000 (SAI, 2001) procedures.
Many companies are trying to demonstrate that their operations
minimize water use and carbon emissions and produce zero
solid waste (ITC, 2006). SD consequences can be observed or
monitored through various indicators grouped under the three
"	Text
"However, the SD consequences of mitigation options are not
automatic. GHG mitigation, per se, has little impact on four
of the SD indicators: poverty reduction, empowerment/gender,
water pollution and solid waste. The literature indicates that
supplementing mitigation options with appropriate national
macroeconomic policies, and with social and local waste
reduction strategies at the company level (Tata Steel, Ltd., 2005;
BEE, 2006), has achieved some sustainability goals. Economy-
wide impact studies (Sathaye et al., 2005; Phadke et al., 2005)
show that in developing countries, like India, adoption of
efficient electricity technology can lead to higher employment
and income generation. However, the lack of empirical studies
leads to much uncertainty about the SD implications of
many mitigation strategies, including use of renewables, fuel
switching, feedstock and product changes, control of non-
CO, gases, and CCS. For example, fuel switching can have a
positive effect on local air pollution and company profitability,
but its impacts on employment are uncertain and will depend on
inter-input substitution opportunities.

Chang, 2003), Bangladesh (Bain, 2005), and Mexico (Aguayo
and Gallagher, 2005), energy and carbon intensity have
decreased, for the industry sector in general and for energy-
intensive industries in particular. In Mexico, deindustrialization
also played a role. For OECD countries, structural change has
also played an important role in emissions reduction. However,
overall economic activity has increased more rapidly, resulting
in higher total carbon emissions.

"Industry’s vulnerability to extreme weather events arises
from site characteristics, for example coastal areas or flood-
prone river basins (high agreement, much evidence). Because
of their financial and technical resources, large industrial
organizations typically have a significant adaptive capacity for
addressing vulnerability to weather extremes. SMEs typically
have fewer financial and technical resources and therefore less
adaptive capacity. The food processing industry, which relies
on agricultural resources that are vulnerable to extreme weather
conditions like floods or droughts, is engaging in dialogue
with its supply chain to reduce GHGs emissions. Companies
are also attempting to reduce vulnerability through product
diversification (Kolk and Pinkse, 2005).
"	Text
"Linkages between adaptation and mitigation in the industrial
sector are limited. In areas dependent on hydropower,
mitigation options that reduce industrial electricity demand
will help in adapting to climate variability or change that affects
water supply (Subak et a/., 2000). Many mitigation options
(e.g., energy efficiency, heat and power recovery, recycling)
are not vulnerable to climate change and therefore create no
additional adaptation link. Others, such as fuel switching can
be vulnerable to climate change under certain circumstances.
As the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season demonstrated, the oil
and gas infrastructure is vulnerable to weather extremes. Use
of solar or biomass energy will be vulnerable to both weather
extremes and climate change. Adaptation, the construction
of more weather resistant facilities and provision of back-up
energy supplies could reduce this vulnerability.
"	Text
"As noted in the TAR (IPCC, 2001b), industrial enterprises
of all sizes are vulnerable to changes in government policy
and consumer preferences. While the specifics of government
climate policies will vary greatly, all will have one of two
fundamental objectives: constraining GHG emissions or
adapting to existing or projected climate change. And while
consumers may become more sensitive to the GHG impacts
of the products and services they use, it is almost certain that
they will continue to seek the traditional qualities of low-cost,
reliability, etc. The challenge to industry will be to continue to
provide the goods and services on which society depends in a
GHG-constrained world. Industry can respond to the potential
for increased government regulation or changes in consumer
preferences in two ways: by mitigating its own GHG emissions
or by developing new, lower GHG emission products and
services. To the extent that industry does this before required
by either regulation or the market, it is demonstrating the type
of anticipatory, or planned, adaptation advocated in the TAR
(IPCC, 2001b).
"	Text
"The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) was created
under the Kyoto Protocol to allow Annex I countries to obtain
GHG emission reduction credits for projects that reduced
GHG emission in non-Annex I countries, provided that those
projects contributed to the sustainable development of the host
country (UNFCCC, 1997). As of November 2006, over 400
projects had been registered, with another 900 in some phase
of the approval process. Total emission reduction potential
of both approved and proposed projects is nearly 1.5 GtCO,
(410 MtC). The majority of these projects are in the energy
sector; as of November 2006, only about 6% of approved CDM
projects were in the industrial sector (UNFCCC, CDM, n.d.).
The concept of Joint Implementation (JI), GHG-emissions
reduction projects carried out jointly by Annex I countries or
business from Annex I countries, is mentioned in the UNFCCC,
but amplified in the Kyoto Protocol. However, since the Kyoto
Protocol does not allow JI credits to be transferred before 2008,
progress on JI implementation has been slow. Both CDM and
JI build on experience gained in the pilot-phase Activities
Implemented Jointly (AIJ) programme created by the UNFCCC
in 1995 (UNFCCC, 1995). A fuller discussion of CDM, JI and
AIJ appears in Section 13.3.3.

"Yamba and Matsika (2004) identified financial, policy,
technical and legal barriers inhibiting participation in the CDM
in sub-Saharan Africa. Financial barriers pose the greatest
challenges: low market value of carbon credits, high CDM
transaction costs and lack of financial resources discourage
industry participation. Policy barriers include limited
awareness of the benefits of CDM and the project approval
process in government and the private sector, non-ratification
of the Kyoto Protocol, and failure to establish the Designated
National Authorities required by CDM. Technical barriers
include limited awareness of the availability of energy-saving
and other appropriate technologies for potential CDM projects.
Legal barriers include limited awareness in government and the
private sector of the Kyoto Protocol, and the legal requirements
for development of CDM projects. Limited human resources
for the development of CDM projects, and CDM’s requirements
on additionality are additional constraints. Other countries, for
example Brazil, China and India (Silayan, 2005), have more
capacity for the development of CDM projects. The Government
of India (GOI, 2004) has identified energy efficiency in the steel
industry as one of the priorities for Indian CDM projects.

"Government-initiated GHG programmes and agreements
that focus on energy-efficiency improvement, reduction of
energy-related GHG emissions and reduction of non-CO, GHG
emissions are found in many countries. Voluntary Agreements
are defined as formal agreements that are essentially contracts
between government and industry that include negotiated
targets with time schedules and commitments on the part of
all participating parties (IEA, 1997). Voluntary agreements
for energy efficiency improvement and reduction of energy-
related GHG emissions by industry have been implemented
in industrialized countries since the early 1990s. These
agreements fall into three categories: completely voluntary;
voluntary with the threat of future taxes or regulation if shown
to be ineffective; and voluntary, but associated with an energy
or carbon tax (Price, 2005). Agreements that include explicit

(Bossoken, 1999; Chidiak, 2000; Chidiak, 2002; Hansen and
Larsen, 1999; OECD, 2002; Starzer, 2000). Recently, a number
of voluntary agreement programmes have been modified and
strengthened, while additional countries, including some
newly industrialized and developing countries, are adopting
such agreements in efforts to increase the efficiency of their
industrial sectors (Price, 2005). Such strengthened programmes
include the French Association des Enterprises por la Réduction

on the Promotion of Energy Conservation in Industry, and the
German Agreement on Climate Protection (AERES, 2005;
IEA, 2004; RWI, 2004). The more successful programmes are
typically those that have either an implicit threat of future taxes
or regulations, or those that work in conjunction with an energy
or carbon tax, such as the Dutch Long-Term Agreements,
the Danish Agreement on Industrial Energy Efficiency and
the UK Climate Change Agreements (see Box 13.2). Such
programmes can provide energy savings beyond business-as-
usual (Bjorner and Jensen, 2002; Future Energy Solutions,
2004; Future Energy Solutions, 2005) and are cost-effective
(Phylipsen and Blok, 2002). The Long-Term Agreements, for
example, stimulated between 27% and 44% (17 to 28 PJ/yr) of
the observed energy savings, which was a 50% increase over
historical autonomous energy efficiency rates in the Netherlands
prior to the agreements (Kerssemeeckers, 2002; Rietbergen et
al., 2002). The UK Climate Change Agreements saved 3.5 to
9.8 MtCO, (1.0 to 2.7 MtC) over the baseline during the first
target period (2000-2002) and 5.1 to 8.9 MtCO, (1.4 to 2.4
MtC) during the second target period (2002-2004) depending

reduction of emissions, especially local air pollutants. These

"Another important influence of waste policies on industrial
GHG emissions is their influence on the availability of
secondary ‘waste’ fuels and raw materials for industrial use.
For example, the ‘EU Landfill Directive’ (EU-OJ, 1999), which
limits the maximum organic content of wastes acceptable for
landfills, resulted in the restructuring of the European waste
sector currently taking place. It makes available substantial
amounts of waste containing significant biomass fractions.
Typically there is competition between the different uses
for these wastes: dedicated incineration in the waste sector,
co-combustion in power plants, or combustion in industrial
processes, for example cement kilns. In order to provide
additional inexpensive disposal routes, several countries have
set incentives to promote the use of various wastes in industrial
processes in direct competition with dedicated incineration.
Emissions trading systems or project-based mechanisms like
CDM/JI can provide additional economic incentives to expand
the use of secondary fuels or biomass as substitutes for fossil
fuels. The impact of switching from a fossil fuel to a secondary
fuel on the energy efficiency of the process itself is frequently
negative, but is often compensated by energy savings in other
parts of the economy.

(e.g., increased safety or employee satisfaction), there are
variations in regulatory regimes vis-a-vis specific emissions and
the value of their reduction and there is a lack of time series and
plant-level data on co-benefits. Also, there is a need to assess
net co-benefits, as negative impacts that may be associated

"Most industrial processes use at least 50% more than the
theoretical minimum energy requirement determined by the
laws of thermodynamics, suggesting a large potential for
energy-efficiency improvement and GHG emission mitigation
(IEA, 2006a). However, RDD&D is required to capture these
potential efficiency gains and achieve significant GHG emission
reductions. Studies have demonstrated that new technologies
are being developed and entering the market continuously,
and that new technologies offer further potential for efficiency
improvement and cost reduction (Worrell et a/., 2002).

"A review of 54 emerging energy-efficient technologies,
produced or implemented in the USA, EU, Japan and other
industrialized countries for the industrial sector, found that 20
of the technologies had environmental benefits in the areas of
‘reduction of wastes’ and ‘emissions of criteria air pollutants’.
The use of such environmentally friendly technologies is often
most compelling when it enables the expansion of incremental
production capacity without requiring additional environmental
permits. In addition, 35 of the technologies had productivity or
product quality benefits (Martin et a/., 2000).
"	Text
"Quantification of the co-benefits of industrial technologies
is often done on a case-by-case basis. One evaluation identified
52 case studies from projects in the USA, the Netherlands, UK,
New Zealand, Canada, Norway and Nigeria that monetized
non-energy savings. These case studies had an average simple
payback time of 4.2 years based on energy savings alone.
Addition of the quantified co-benefits reduced the simple
payback time to 1.9 years (Worrell et al., 2003). Inclusion of
quantified co-benefits in an energy-conservation supply curve
for the US iron and steel industry doubled the potential for cost-
effective savings (Worrell et a/., 2001a; 2003).

"Many studies have indicated that the technology required
to reduce GHG emissions and eventually stabilize their
atmospheric concentrations is not currently available (Jacoby,
1998; Hoffert et al., 2002; Edmonds ef al., 2003) (medium
agreement, medium evidence). While these studies concentrated
on energy supply options, they also indicate that significant
improvements in end-use energy efficiency will be necessary.
Much of the necessary research and development is being
carried out in public-private partnerships, for example the US
Department of Energy’s Industrial Technologies Program (US
DOE, n.d.-b).

"While GHG mitigation is not the only objective of energy
R&D, IEA studies show a mismatch between R&D spending and
the contribution of technologies to reduction of CO, emissions.
In its analysis of its Accelerated Technology scenarios, IEA
(2006a) found that end-use energy efficiency, much of it in
the industrial sector, contributed most to mitigation of CO,
emissions from energy use. It accounted for 39-53% of the
projected reduction, except in the scenario that deemphasized
these technologies. However, IEA countries spent only 17% of
their public energy R&D budgets on energy-efficiency (IEA,
2005).

"it is important to realize that successful technologies must
also meet a host of other performance criteria, including cost
competitiveness, safety, and regulatory requirements; as well
as winning consumer acceptance. (These topics are discussed
in more detail in Section 7.11.2.) While some technology is
marketed as energy-efficient, other benefits may drive the
development and diffusion of the technology, as evidenced by
a case study of impulse drying in the paper industry, in which
the driver was productivity (Luiten and Blok, 2004). This is
understandable given that energy cost is just one of the drivers
for technology development. Innovation and the technology
transfer process are discussed in Section 2.8.2.

"Technology RDD&D is carried out by both governments
(public sector) and companies (private sector). Ideally, the
roles of the public and private sectors will be complementary.
Flannery (2001) argued that it is appropriate for governments
to identify the fundamental barriers to technology and find
solutions that improve performance, including environmental,
cost and safety performance, and perhaps customer
acceptability; but that the private sector should bear the risk
and capture the rewards of commercializing technology. Case
studies of specific successful energy-efficient technologies,
including shoe press in papermaking (Luiten and Blok, 2003a)
and strip casting in the steel industry (Luiten and Blok, 2003b),
have shown that a better understanding of the technology and
the development process is essential in the design of effective
government support of technology development. Government
can also play an important role in cultivating ‘champions’ for
technology development, and by ‘anchoring’ energy and climate
as important continuous drivers for technology development
(Luiten and Blok, 2003a).

include information exchange activities to promote technology

the US Industrial Technologies Program claimed cumulative

of more than 90 technologies across the US industrial sector
(US DOE, 2006). EU programmes, for example Lights of the

other regions.

"Industrial RDD&D programmes assume that technologies
are easily adapted across regions with little innovation. This
is not always the case. While many industrial facilities in
developing nations are new and include the latest technology,
as in industrialized countries, many older, inefficient facilities
remain. The problem is exacerbated by the presence of large
numbers of small-scale, much less energy-efficient plants in
some developing nations; for example the iron and steel, cement
and pulp and paper industries in China, and in the iron and steel
industry in India (IEA, 2006a). This creates a huge demand for
technology transfer to developing countries to achieve energy
efficiency and emissions reductions.

"Governments are often more willing than companies to

willingness is articulated in the US Department of Energy’s

research and development that will reduce industrial energy
requirements while stimulating economic productivity and
growth’ (US DOE, n.d.-a). The Institute for Environment
and Sustainability of the EU’s Joint Research Centre has a
similar mission, albeit focusing on renewable energy (Joint

"Selection of technology is a crucial step in any technology
adoption. Governments can play an important role in technology
diffusion by disseminating information about new technologies
and by providing an environment that encourages the
implementation of energy-efficient technologies. For example,
energy audit programmes, provide more targeted information
than simple advertising. Audits by the US Department of
Energy’s Industrial Assessment Center program in SMEs
resulted in implementation of about 42% of the suggested
measures (Muller and Barnish, 1998). Programmes or policies
that promote or require reporting and benchmarking of energy
consumption can have a similar function. These programmes
have been implemented in many countries, including Canada,
Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, the UK and the
USA (Sun and Williamson, 1999), and in specific industrial
sectors such as the petroleum refining, ethylene and aluminium
industries. (See Section 7.3.1).

"Multilaterally, the UNFCCC has resulted in the creation
of two technology diffusion efforts, the Climate Technology
Initiative (CTI) and the UNFCCC Secretariat’s TT:CLEAR
technology transfer database. CTI was established in 1995 by 23
IEA/OECD member countries and the European Commission,
and as of 2003 has been recognized as an IEA Implementing
Agreement. Its focus is the identification of climate technology
needs in developing countries and countries with economies-
in-transition, and filling those needs with training, information
dissemination and other support activities (CTI, 2005). TT:
CLEAR is a more passive technology diffusion mechanism
that depends on users accessing the database and finding the
information they need (UNFCCC, 2004). Additionally, in 2001,
the UNFCCC established an Expert Group on Technology
Transfer (EGTT) (UNFCCC, 2001). EGTT has promoted
a number of activities including workshops on enabling
environments and innovative financing for technology transfer.
Ultimately, the Kyoto Protocol’s CDM and JI should act as
powerful tools for the diffusion of GHG mitigation technology.

"Inertia in the industrial sector is characterized by capital

While opportunities exist for retrofitting some capital stock,
basic changes in technology occur only when the capital stock
is installed or replaced. This inertia is often referred to as
“technology lock-in’, a concept first proposed by Arthur (1988).
IEA (2006a) discusses the potential effects of technology lock-
in in electric power generation, where much of the capital stock
in developed nations will be replaced, and much of the capital
stock in developing nations will be installed, in the next few
decades. Installation of lower-cost, but less efficient technology

"	Title
"Agricultural lands (lands used for agricultural production,
consisting of cropland, managed grassland and permanent crops
including agro-forestry and bio-energy crops) occupy about 40-
50% of the Earth’s land surface.

"Considering all gases, the global technical mitigation
potential from agriculture (excluding fossil fuel offsets from
biomass) by 2030 is estimated to be ~5500-6,000 MtCO,-eq/yr
(medium agreement, medium evidence). Economic potentials
are estimated to be 1500-1600, 2500-2700, and 4000-4300
MtCO,-eq/yr at carbon prices of up to 20, 50 and 100 US$/
tCO,-eq, respectively About 70% of the potential lies in non-
OECD/EIT countries, 20% in OECD countries and 10% for
EIT countries (medium agreement, limited evidence).
"	Text
"Globally, agricultural CH, and N,O emissions have increased
by nearly 17% from 1990 to 2005, an average annual emis-
sion increase of about 60 MtCO,-eq/yr. During that period,
the five regions composed of Non-Annex | countries showed a
32% increase, and were, by 2005, responsible for about three-
quarters of total agricultural emissions. The other five regions,
mostly Annex I countries, collectively showed a decrease of
12% in the emissions of these gases (high agreement, much
evidence).
"	Text
"Agricultural GHG mitigation options are found to be cost
competitive with non-agricultural options (e.g., energy, trans-
portation, forestry) in achieving long-term (i.e., 2100) climate
objectives. Global long-term modelling suggests that non-CO,
crop and livestock abatement options could cost-effectively
contribute 270-1520 MtCO,-eq/yr globally in 2030 with car-
bon prices up to 20 US$/tCO,-eq and 640-1870 MtCO,-eq/yr
with C prices up to 50 US$/tCO,-eq Soil carbon management
options are not currently considered in long-term modelling
(medium agreement, limited evidence).
"	Text
"Agriculture accounted for an estimated emission of 5.1 to
6.1 GtCO)-eq/yr in 2005 (10-12% of total global anthropogenic
emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs)). CH, contributes 3.3
GtCO,-eq/yr and N,O 2.8 GtCO,-eq/yr. Of global anthropogenic
emissions in 2005, agriculture accounts for about 60% of
N,O and about 50% of CH, (medium agreement, medium
evidence). Despite large annual exchanges of CO, between the
atmosphere and agricultural lands, the net flux is estimated to
be approximately balanced, with CO, emissions around 0.04
GtCO,/yr only (emissions from electricity and fuel use are
covered in the buildings and transport sector, respectively) (low
agreement, limited evidence).

"The role of alternative strategies changes across the range
of prices for carbon. At low prices, dominant strategies are
those consistent with existing production such as changes in
tillage, fertilizer application, livestock diet formulation, and
manure management. Higher prices elicit land-use changes that
displace existing production, such as biofuels, and allow for
use of costly animal feed-based mitigation options. A practice
effective in reducing emissions at one site may be less effective
or even counterproductive elsewhere. Consequently, there is
no universally applicable list of mitigation practices; practices
need to be evaluated for individual agricultural systems based
on climate, edaphic, social setting, and historical patterns of
land use and management (high agreement, much evidence).
"	Text
"A variety of options exists for mitigation of GHG emissions

in agriculture. The most prominent options are improved crop
and grazing land management (e.g., improved agronomic
practices, nutrient use, tillage, and residue management), res-
toration of organic soils that are drained for crop production
and restoration of degraded lands. Lower but still significant
mitigation is possible with improved water and rice manage-
ment; set-asides, land use change (e.g., conversion of cropland
to grassland) and agro-forestry; as well as improved livestock
and manure management. Many mitigation opportunities use
current technologies and can be implemented immediately, but
technological development will be a key driver ensuring the
efficacy of additional mitigation measures in the future (high
agreement, much evidence).
"	Text
"GHG emissions could also be reduced by substituting fossil
fuels with energy produced from agricultural feed stocks (e.g.,
crop residues, dung, energy crops), which would be counted
in sectors using the energy. The contribution of agriculture to
the mitigation potential by using bioenergy depends on relative
prices of the fuels and the balance of supply and demand. Using
top-down models that include assumptions on such a balance
the economic mitigation potential for agriculture in 2030 is
estimated to be 70-1260 MtCO,-eq/yr at up to 20 US$/tCO,-eq,
and 560-2320 MtCO)-eq/yr at up to 50 US$/tCO,-eq There are
no estimates for the additional potential from top down models
at carbon prices up to 100 US$/tCO,-eq, but the estimate for
prices above 100 US$/tCO,-eq is 2720 MtCO,-eq/yr. These
potentials represent mitigation of 5-80%, and 20-90% of all

"Soil carbon sequestration (enhanced sinks) is the mechanism
responsible for most of the mitigation potential (high agreement,
much evidence), with an estimated 89% contribution to the
technical potantial. Mitigation of CH, emissions and N,O
emissions from soils account for 9% and 2%, respectively,
of the total mitigation potential (medium agreement, medium
evidence). The upper and lower limits about the estimates are
largely determined by uncertainty in the per-area estimate
for each mitigation measure. Overall, principal sources of
uncertainties inherent in these mitigation potentials include: a)
future level of adoption of mitigation measures (as influenced
by barriers to adoption); b) effectiveness of adopted measures
in enhancing carbon sinks or reducing N,O and CH, emissions
(particularly in tropical areas; reflected in the upper and lower
bounds given above); and c) persistence of mitigation, as
influenced by future climatic trends, economic conditions, and
social behaviour (medium agreement, limited evidence).

"other agricultural mitigation measures combined, at carbon
prices of up to 20, and up toS0 US$/tCO,-eq, respectively. An
additional mitigation of 770 MtCO,-eq/yr could be achieved
by 2030 by improved energy efficiency in agriculture, though
the mitigation potential is counted mainly in the buildings and
transport sectors (medium agreement, medium evidence).

"Overall, the outlook for GHG mitigation in agriculture
suggests that there is significant potential (high agreement,
medium evidence). Current initiatives suggest that synergy
between climate change policies, sustainable development and
improvement of environmental quality will likely lead the way
forward to realize the mitigation potential in this sector.
"	Text
"Agricultural mitigation measures often have synergy with
sustainable development policies, and many explicitly influence
social, economic, and environmental aspects of sustainability.
Many options also have co-benefits (improved efficiency,
reduced cost, environmental co-benefits) as well as trade-offs
(e.g., increasing other forms of pollution), and balancing these
effects will be necessary for successful implementation (high
agreement, much evidence).
"	Text
"In many regions, non-climate policies related to macro-
economics, agriculture and the environment, have a larger
impact on agricultural mitigation than climate policies (high
agreement, much evidence). Despite significant technical
potential for mitigation in agriculture, there is evidence that little
progress has been made in the implementation of mitigation
measures at the global scale. Barriers to implementation are not
likely to be overcome without policy/economic incentives and
other programmes, such as those promoting global sharing of
innovative technologies.
"	Text
"Current GHG emission rates may escalate in the future due
to population growth and changing diets (high agreement,
medium evidence). Greater demand for food could result in
higher emissions of CH, and N,O if there are more livestock
and greater use of nitrogen fertilizers (high agreement, much
evidence). Deployment of new mitigation practices for livestock
systems and fertilizer applications will be essential to prevent an
increase in emissions from agriculture after 2030. In addition,
soil carbon may be more vulnerable to loss with climate
change and other pressures, though increases in production will
offset some or all of this carbon loss (low agreement, limited
evidence).
"	Text
"There are interactions between mitigation and adaptation in
the agricultural sector, which may occur simultaneously, but
differ in their spatial and geographic characteristics. The main
climate change benefits of mitigation actions will emerge over
decades, but there may also be short-term benefits if the drivers
achieve other policy objectives. Conversely, actions to enhance
adaptation to climate change impacts will have consequences
in the short and long term. Most mitigation measures are likely
robust to future climate change (e.g., nutrient management),
but a subset will likely be vulnerable (e.g., irrigation in regions
becoming more arid). It may be possible for a vulnerable
practice to be modified as the climate changes and to maintain
the efficacy of a mitigation measure (/ow agreement, limited
evidence).

from the agricultural sector (Section 8.2), and details agricultural
practices that may mitigate GHGs (Section 8.4.1), with many

mechanism. These practices include: cropland management;
grazing land management/pasture improvement; management
of agricultural organic soils; restoration of degraded lands;
livestock management; manure/bio-solid management; and
bio-energy production.

"Population pressure, technological change, public policies,
and economic growth and the cost/price squeeze have been the
main drivers of change in the agricultural sector during the last
four decades. Production of food and fibre has more than kept
pace with the sharp increase in demand in a more populated
world. The global average daily availability of calories per
capita has increased (Gilland, 2002), with some notable regional
exceptions. This growth, however, has been at the expense of
increased pressure on the environment, and depletion of natural
resources (Tilman et al., 2001; Rees, 2003), while it has not
resolved the problems of food security and child malnutrition
suffered in poor countries (Conway and Toenniessen, 1999).

"Agriculture releases to the atmosphere significant amounts
of CO;, CHy, and N,O (Cole et al., 1997; IPCC, 2001a;
Paustian et al., 2004). CO, is released largely from microbial
decay or burning of plant litter and soil organic matter (Smith,
2004b; Janzen, 2004). CH, is produced when organic materials
decompose in oxygen-deprived conditions, notably from
fermentative digestion by ruminant livestock, from stored
manures, and from rice grown under flooded conditions (Mosier
et al. 1998). N,O is generated by the microbial transformation
of nitrogen in soils and manures, and is often enhanced where
available nitrogen (N) exceeds plant requirements, especially
under wet conditions (Oenema et al., 2005; Smith and Conen,
2004). Agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes are complex
and heterogeneous, but the active management of agricultural
systems offers possibilities for mitigation. Many of these
mitigation opportunities use current technologies and can be
implemented immediately.

"Growth in land productivity is expected to continue,
although at a declining rate, due to decreasing returns from
further technological progress, and greater use of marginal
land with lower productivity. Use of these marginal lands
increases the risk of soil erosion and degradation, with
highly uncertain consequences for CO, emissions (Lal,
2004a; Van Oost et al., 2004).

Conservation tillage and zero-tillage are increasingly being
adopted, thus reducing the use of energy and often increas-
ing carbon storage in soils. According to FAO (2001), the
worldwide area under zero-tillage in 1999 was approxi-
mately 50 Mha, representing 3.5% of total arable land.
However, such practices are frequently combined with
periodical tillage, thus making the assessment of the GHG
balance highly uncertain.

Further improvements in productivity will require higher
use of irrigation and fertilizer, increasing the energy
demand (for moving water and manufacturing fertilizer;
Schlesinger, 1999). Also, irrigation and N fertilization can
increase GHG emissions (Mosier, 2001).

"feeds (e.g., cereals). Larger herds of beef cattle will cause
increased emissions of CH, and N,O, although use of
intensive systems (with lower emissions per unit product)
is expected to increase faster than growth in grazing-based
systems. This may attenuate the expected rise in GHG
emissions.

Intensive production of beef, poultry, and pork is increas-
ingly common, leading to increases in manure with con-
sequent increases in GHG emissions. This is particularly
true in the developing regions of South and East Asia, and
Latin America, as well as in North America.

Changes in policies (e.g., subsidies), and regional patterns
of production and demand are causing an increase in inter-
national trade of agricultural products. This is expected to
increase CO, emissions, due to greater use of energy for
transportation.

There is an emerging trend for greater use of agricultural

ergy) as substitutes for fossil fuel-based products. This has
the potential to reduce GHG emissions in the future.

"With an estimated global emission of non-CO, GHGs from
agriculture of between 5120 MtCO,-eq/yr (Denman et al., 2007)
and 6116 MtCO,-eq/yr (US-EPA, 2006a) in 2005, agriculture
accounts for 10-12 % of total global anthropogenic emissions
of GHGs. Agriculture contributes about 47% and 58% of total
anthropogenic emissions of CH, and N,O, respectively, with a
wide range of uncertainty in the estimates of both the agricultural
contribution and the anthropogenic total. N,O emissions from
soils and CH, from enteric fermentation constitute the largest
sources, 38% and 32% of total non-CO, emissions from
agriculture in 2005, respectively (US-EPA, 2006a). Biomass
burning (12%), rice production (11%), and manure management
(7%) account for the rest. CO, emissions from agricultural soils
are not normally estimated separately, but are included in the
land use, land use change and forestry sector (e.g., in national
GHG inventories). So there are few comparable estimates of
emissions of this gas in agriculture. Agricultural lands generate
very large CO, fluxes both to and from the atmosphere (IPCC,
2001a), but the net flux is small. US-EPA, 2006b) estimated a
net CO, emission of 40 MtCO,-eq from agricultural soils in

agricultural emissions might be expected to rise to 8000-8400,
with a mean of 8300 MtCO,-eq by 2030. The future evolution
of CO, emissions from agriculture is uncertain. Due to stable

adoption of conservation tillage practices (FAO, 2001), these

could result in a 2 to 2.5-fold rise in grain and fodder yields,
with a consequent reduction of arable land, but may increase N
fertilizer use. Decreases in fertilizer N use since 1990 have led to
a significant reduction in N,O emissions. But, under favourable
economic conditions, the amount of N fertilizer applied will
again increase, although unlikely to reach pre-1990 levels in the
near future. US-EPA (2006a) projected a 32% increase in N,O
emissions from soils in these two regions between 2005 and
2020, equivalent to an average rate of increase of 3.5 MtCO,-

"East Asia is projected to show large increases in GHG
emissions from animal sources. According to FAO (FAOSTAT,
2006), total production of meat and milk in Asian developing
countries increased more than 12 times and 4 times, respectively,
from 2004 to 1961. Since the per-capita consumption of
meat and milk is still much lower in these countries than in
developed countries, increasing trends are expected to continue
for a relatively long time. Accordingly, US-EPA (2006a)
forecast increases of 153% and 86% in emissions from enteric
fermentation and manure management, respectively, from 1990
to 2020. In South Asia, emissions are increasing mostly because
of expanding use of N fertilizers and manure to meet demands
for food, resulting from rapid population growth.
"	Text
"The Middle East and North Africa, and Sub-Saharan
Africa have the highest projected growth in emissions, with a
combined 95% increase in the period 1990 to 2020 (US-EPA,
2006a). Sub-Saharan Africa is the one world region where per-
capita food production is either in decline, or roughly constant
at a level that is less than adequate (Scholes and Biggs, 2004).
This trend is linked to low and declining soil fertility (Sanchez,
2002), and inadequate fertilizer inputs. Although slow, the
rising wealth of urban populations is likely to increase demand
for livestock products. This would result in intensification of
agriculture and expansion to still largely unexploited areas,
particularly in South and Central Africa (including Angola,
Zambia, DRC, Mozambique and Tanzania), with a consequent
increase in GHG emissions.
"	Text
"In Latin America and the Caribbean, agricultural products
are the main source of exports. Significant changes in land
use and management have occurred, with forest conversion
to cropland and grassland being the most significant, resulting
in increased GHG emissions from soils (CO, and N,O). The
cattle population has increased linearly from 176 to 379 Mhead
between 1961 and 2004, partly offset by a decrease in the sheep
population from 125 to 80 Mhead. All other livestock categories
have increased in the order of 30 to 600% since 1961. Cropland
areas, including rice and soybean, and the use of N fertilizers
have also shown dramatic increases (FAOSTAT, 2006). Another
major trend in the region is the increased adoption of no-till
agriculture, particularly in the Mercosur area (Brazil, Argentina,
Paraguay, and Uruguay). This technology is used on ~30 Mha
every year in the region, although it is unknown how much of
this area is under permanent no-till.

"OECD North America and OECD Pacific are the only
developed regions showing a consistent increase in GHG
emissions in the agricultural sector (18% and 21%, respectively
between 1990 and 2020; Figure 8.2). In both cases, the trend is
largely driven by non-CO, emissions from manure management
and N,O emissions from soils. In Oceania, nitrogen fertilizer
use has increased exponentially over the past 45 years with
a 5 and 2.5 fold increase since 1990 in New Zealand and
Australia, respectively. In North America, in contrast, nitrogen
fertilizer use has remained stable; the main driver for increasing
emissions is management of manure from cattle, poultry and
swine production, and manure application to soils. In both
regions, conservation policies have resulted in reduced CO,
emissions from land conversion. Land clearing in Australia
has declined by 60% since 1990 with vegetation management
policies restricting further clearing, while in North America,
some marginal croplands have been returned to woodland or
grassland.

of these practices also have indirect effects on ecosystems
elsewhere. For example, increased productivity in existing
croplands could avoid deforestation and its attendant emissions
(see also Section 8.8). The most important options are discussed
in Section 8.4.1.

"Avoiding (or displacing) emissions: Crops and residues
from agricultural lands can be used as a source of fuel, ei-
ther directly or after conversion to fuels such as ethanol
or diesel (Schneider and McCarl, 2003; Cannell, 2003).
These bio-energy feedstocks still release CO, upon com-
bustion, but now the carbon is of recent atmospheric origin
(via photosynthesis), rather than from fossil carbon. The
net benefit of these bio-energy sources to the atmosphere
is equal to the fossil-derived emissions displaced, less any
emissions from producing, transporting, and processing.
GHG emissions, notably CO), can also be avoided by agri-
cultural management practices that forestall the cultivation
of new lands now under forest, grassland, or other non-ag-
ricultural vegetation (Foley et al., 2005).

"b.

Enhancing removals: Agricultural ecosystems hold large
carbon reserves (IPCC, 2001a), mostly in soil organic mat-
ter. Historically, these systems have lost more than 50 Pg C
(Paustian ef al., 1998; Lal, 1999, 2004a), but some of this
carbon lost can be recovered through improved manage-
ment, thereby withdrawing atmospheric CO). Any practice
that increases the photosynthetic input of carbon and/or
slows the return of stored carbon to CO, via respiration,
fire or erosion will increase carbon reserves, thereby ‘se-
questering’ carbon or building carbon ‘sinks’. Many stud-
ies, worldwide, have now shown that significant amounts
of soil carbon can be stored in this way, through a range
of practices, suited to local conditions (Lal, 2004a). Sig-
nificant amounts of vegetative carbon can also be stored in
agro-forestry systems or other perennial plantings on ag-
ricultural lands (Albrecht and Kandji, 2003). Agricultural
lands also remove CH, from the atmosphere by oxidation
(but less than forests; Tate et al., 2006), but this effect is
small compared to other GHG fluxes (Smith and Conen,
2004).
"	List
"Agronomy: Improved agronomic practices that increase
yields and generate higher inputs of carbon residue can
lead to increased soil carbon storage (Follett, 2001). Ex-
amples of such practices include: using improved crop
varieties; extending crop rotations, notably those with
perennial crops that allocate more carbon below ground;
and avoiding or reducing use of bare (unplanted) fal-
low (West and Post, 2002; Smith, 2004a, b; Lal, 2003,
2004a; Freibauer et al., 2004). Adding more nutrients,
when deficient, can also promote soil carbon gains (Alva-
rez, 2005), but the benefits from N fertilizer can be off-
set by higher NO emissions from soils and CO, from
fertilizer manufacture (Schlesinger, 1999; Pérez-Ramirez
et al., 2003; Robertson, 2004; Gregorich et al., 2005).
Emissions per hectare can also be reduced by adopting
cropping systems with reduced reliance on fertilizers,
pesticides and other inputs (and therefore, the GHG cost
of their production: Paustian et al., 2004). An important
example is the use of rotations with legume crops (West
and Post, 2002; Izaurralde et al., 2001), which reduce re-
liance on external N inputs although legume-derived N
can also be a source of N,O (Rochette and Janzen, 2005).
Another group of agronomic practices are those that pro-
vide temporary vegetative cover between successive agri-
cultural crops, or between rows of tree or vine crops. These
‘catch’ or ‘cover’ crops add carbon to soils (Barthés et al.,
2004; Freibauer et al., 2004) and may also extract plant-
available N unused by the preceding crop, thereby reduc-
ing N,O emissions.

nures, biosolids, and other N sources is not always used

"of N,O (McSwiney and Robertson, 2005). Consequently,
improving N use efficiency can reduce N,O emissions and
indirectly reduce GHG emissions from N fertilizer manu-
facture (Schlesinger, 1999). By reducing leaching and vol-
atile losses, improved efficiency of N use can also reduce
off-site N,O emissions. Practices that improve N use effi-
ciency include: adjusting application rates based on precise
estimation of crop needs (e.g., precision farming); using
slow- or controlled-release fertilizer forms or nitrification
inhibitors (which slow the microbial processes leading to
N,O formation); applying N when least susceptible to loss,
often just prior to plant uptake (improved timing); placing
the N more precisely into the soil to make it more acces-
sible to crops roots; or avoiding N applications in excess of
immediate plant requirements (Robertson, 2004; Dalal et
al., 2003; Paustian et al., 2004; Cole et al., 1997; Monteny
et al., 2006).

"Tillage/residue management: Advances in weed control
methods and farm machinery now allow many crops to
be grown with minimal tillage (reduced tillage) or without
tillage (no-till). These practices are now increasingly used
throughout the world (e.g., Cerri et al., 2004). Since soil
disturbance tends to stimulate soil carbon losses through
enhanced decomposition and erosion (Madari et al., 2005),
reduced- or no-till agriculture often results in soil carbon
gain, but not always (West and Post, 2002; Ogle et al.,
2005; Gregorich et al., 2005; Alvarez 2005). Adopting re-
duced- or no-till may also affect N,O, emissions but the
net effects are inconsistent and not well-quantified glo-
bally (Smith and Conen, 2004; Helgason et al., 2005; Li
et al., 2005; Cassman et al., 2003). The effect of reduced
tillage on N,O emissions may depend on soil and climatic
conditions. In some areas, reduced tillage promotes N,O
emissions, while elsewhere it may reduce emissions or
have no measurable influence (Marland et al., 2001). Fur-

"Grazing lands occupy much larger areas than croplands
(FAOSTAT, 2006) and are usually managed less intensively. The
following are examples of practices to reduce GHG emissions
and to enhance removals:
"	Text
"a. Grazing intensity: The intensity and timing of grazing can
influence the removal, growth, carbon allocation, and flora
of grasslands, thereby affecting the amount of carbon ac-
crual in soils (Conant et al., 2001; 2005; Freibauer et al.,
2004; Conant and Paustian, 2002; Reeder et al., 2004).
Carbon accrual on optimally grazed lands is often greater
than on ungrazed or overgrazed lands (Liebig et al., 2005;
Rice and Owensby, 2001). The effects are inconsistent,
however, owing to the many types of grazing practices
"	List
"Rice management: Cultivated wetland rice soils emit sig-
nificant quantities of methane (Yan et al., 2003). Emissions
during the growing season can be reduced by various prac-
tices (Yagi et al., 1997; Wassmann et al., 2000; Aulakh et
al., 2001). For example, draining wetland rice once or sev-
eral times during the growing season reduces CH, emis-
sions (Smith and Conen, 2004; Yan et al., 2003; Khalil and
Shearer, 2006). This benefit, however, may be partly offset
by increased N,O emissions (Akiyama ef al. 2005), and the
practice may be constrained by water supply. Rice cultivars
with low exudation rates could offer an important methane
mitigation option (Aulakh e¢ a/., 2001). In the off-rice sea-
son, methane emissions can be reduced by improved water
management, especially by keeping the soil as dry as possi-
ble and avoiding water logging (Cai et al., 2000 2003; Kang
et al., 2002; Xu et al., 2003). Increasing rice production can
also enhance soil organic carbon stocks (Pan et al., 2006).
Methane emissions can be reduced by adjusting the timing
of organic residue additions (e.g., incorporating organic
materials in the dry period rather than in flooded periods;
Xu et al., 2000; Cai and Xu, 2004), by composting the resi-
dues before incorporation, or by producing biogas for use
as fuel for energy production (Wang and Shangguan, 1996;
Wassmann et al., 2000).
"	List
"ther, no-tillage systems can reduce CO, emissions from
energy use (Marland et al., 2003b; Koga et al., 2006).
Systems that retain crop residues also tend to increase soil
carbon because these residues are the precursors for soil
organic matter, the main carbon store in soil. Avoiding the
burning of residues (e.g., mechanising sugarcane harvest-
ing, eliminating the need for pre-harvest burning (Cerri et
al., 2004)) also avoids emissions of aerosols and GHGs
generated from fire, although CO, emissions from fuel use
may increase.

d. Water management: About 18% of the world’s croplands
now receive supplementary water through irrigation (Mil-
lennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005). Expanding this
area (where water reserves allow) or using more effec-
tive irrigation measures can enhance carbon storage in
soils through enhanced yields and residue returns (Follett,
2001; Lal, 2004a). But some of these gains may be offset
by CO, from energy used to deliver the water (Schlesing-
er 1999; Mosier et al., 2005) or from NO emissions
from higher moisture and fertilizer N inputs (Liebig et
al. 2005), The latter effect has not been widely measured.
Drainage of croplands lands in humid regions can promote
productivity (and hence soil carbon) and perhaps also sup-
press N,O emissions by improving aeration (Monteny ef al.,
2006). Any nitrogen lost through drainage, however, may be
susceptible to loss as N,O.(Reay et al. 2003).

ing stock of carbon above ground is usually higher than the
equivalent land use without trees, and planting trees may
also increase soil carbon sequestration (Oelbermann et al.,
2004; Guo and Gifford, 2002; Mutuo et al., 2005; Paul et
al., 2003). But the effects on N,O and CH, emissions are
not well known (Albrecht and Kandji, 2003).

Land cover (use) change: One of the most effective meth-

ods of reducing emissions is often to allow or encourage the
reversion of cropland to another land cover, typically one
similar to the native vegetation. The conversion can occur
over the entire land area (‘set-asides’), or in localized spots,
such as grassed waterways, field margins, or shelterbelts
(Follett, 2001; Freibauer et al., 2004; Lal, 2004b; Falloon et
al., 2004; Ogle et al., 2003). Such land cover change often
increases carbon storage. For example, converting arable
cropland to grassland typically results in the accrual of soil
carbon because of lower soil disturbance and reduced car-
bon removal in harvested products. Compared to cultivated
lands, grasslands may also have reduced N,O emissions
from lower N inputs, and higher rates of CH, oxidation, but
recovery of oxidation may be slow (Paustian et a/., 2004).
Similarly, converting drained croplands back to wet-
lands can result in rapid accumulation of soil carbon
(removal of atmospheric CO). This conversion may
stimulate CH, emissions because water logging cre-
ates anaerobic conditions (Paustian ef al., 2004). Plant-
ing trees can also reduce emissions. These practices are
considered under agro-forestry (Section 8.4.1.1f); af-
forestation (Chapter 9), and reafforestation (Chapter 9).
Because land cover (or use) conversion comes at the ex-
pense of lost agricultural productivity, it is usually an op-
tion only on surplus agricultural land or on croplands of
marginal productivity.

"Organic or peaty soils contain high densities of carbon
accumulated over many centuries because decomposition is
suppressed by absence of oxygen under flooded conditions. To
be used for agriculture, these soils are drained, which aerates
the soil, favouring decomposition and therefore, high CO,
and N,O fluxes. Methane emissions are usually suppressed
after draining, but this effect is far outweighed by pronounced
increases in N,O and CO, (Kasimir-Klemedtsson et a/., 1997).
Emissions from drained organic soils can be reduced to some
extent by practices such as avoiding row crops and tubers,
avoiding deep ploughing, and maintaining a shallower water
table. But the most important mitigation practice is avoiding the
drainage of these soils in the first place or re-establishing a high
water table (Freibauer ef al., 2004).

"ecosystems would still burn as a result of climatic factors.

Species introduction: Introducing grass species with higher
productivity, or carbon allocation to deeper roots, has been
shown to increase soil carbon. For example, establishing
deep-rooted grasses in savannahs has been reported to yield
very high rates of carbon accrual (Fisher et al., 1994), al-
though the applicability of these results has not been wide-
ly confirmed (Conant et al., 2001; Davidson et al., 1995).
In the Brazilian Savannah (Cerrado Biome), integrated
crop-livestock systems using Brachiaria grasses and zero
tillage are being adopted (Machado and Freitas, 2004).
Introducing legumes into grazing lands can promote soil
carbon storage (Soussana et al., 2004), through enhanced
productivity from the associated N inputs, and perhaps also
reduced emissions from fertilizer manufacture if biologi-
cal N, fixation displaces applied N fertilizer N (Sisti et al.,
2004; Diekow et al., 2005). Ecological impacts of species
introduction need to be considered.

proved by a variety of measures that promote productivity.
For instance, alleviating nutrient deficiencies by fertilizer
or organic amendments increases plant litter returns and,
hence, soil carbon storage (Schnabel et al., 2001; Conant
et al., 2001). Adding nitrogen, however, often stimulates
N,O emissions (Conant et al., 2005) thereby offsetting
some of the benefits. Irrigating grasslands, similarly, can
promote soil carbon gains (Conant et al., 2001). The net
effect of this practice, however, depends also on emissions
from energy use and other activities on the irrigated land
(Schlesinger, 1999).

Nutrient management: Practices that tailor nutrient addi-
tions to plant uptake, such as those described for croplands,
can reduce NO emissions (Dalal et al., 2003; Follett et al.,
2001). Management of nutrients on grazing lands, howev-
er, may be complicated by deposition of faeces and urine
from livestock, which are not as easily controlled nor as
uniformly applied as nutritive amendments in croplands
(Oenema et al., 2005).

Fire management: On-site biomass burning (not to be con-
fused with bio-energy, where biomass is combusted off-site
for energy) contributes to climate change in several ways.
Firstly, it releases GHGs, notably CH, and, and to a lesser
extent, N,O (the CO, released is of recent origin, is ab-
sorbed by vegetative regrowth, and is usually not included
in GHG inventories). Secondly, it generates hydrocarbon
and reactive nitrogen emissions, which react to form tropo-
spheric ozone, a powerful GHG. Thirdly, fires produce a
range of smoke aerosols which can have either warming or
cooling effects on the atmosphere; the net effect is thought
to be positive radiative forcing (Andreae et al., 2005; Jones
et al., 2003; Venkataraman et al., 2005; Andreae, 2001;
Andreae and Merlet, 2001; Anderson et al., 2003; Menon
et al., 2002). Fourth, fire reduces the albedo of the land sur-
face for several weeks, causing warming (Beringer ef al.,
2003). Finally, burning can affect the proportion of woody
versus grass cover, notably in savannahs, which occupy
about an eighth of the global land surface. Reducing the
frequency or intensity of fires typically leads to increased
tree and shrub cover, resulting in a CO, sink in soil and
biomass (Scholes and van der Merwe, 1996). This woody-
plant encroachment mechanism saturates over 20-50 years,
whereas avoided CH, and N,O emissions continue as long
as fires are suppressed.

Mitigation actions involve reducing the frequency or
extent of fires through more effective fire suppression: re-

"grasses); improving fertility by nutrient amendments; applying
organic substrates such as manures, biosolids, and composts;
reducing tillage and retaining crop residues; and conserving
water (Lal, 2001b; 2004b; Bruce et al., 1999; Olsson and Ardé,
2002; Paustian etal., 2004). Where these practices involve higher
nitrogen amendments, the benefits of carbon sequestration may
be partly offset by higher NO emissions.

"Animal manures can release significant amounts of N,O and
CH, during storage, but the magnitude of these emissions varies.
Methane emissions from manure stored in lagoons or tanks
can be reduced by cooling, use of solid covers, mechanically
separating solids from slurry, or by capturing the CH, emitted
(Amon et al. 2006; Clemens and Ahlgrimm, 2001; Monteny et
al. 2001, 2006; Paustian et al., 2004). The manures can also be

Specific agents and dietary additives: A wide range of spe-

cific agents, mostly aimed at suppressing methanogenesis,

has been proposed as dietary additives to reduce CH, emis-

sions:

¢ Ionophores are antibiotics that can reduce methane
emissions (Benz and Johnson, 1982; Van Nevel and
Demeyer, 1996; McGinn et al., 2004), but their effect
may be transitory (Rumpler et al., 1986); and they have
been banned in the EU.

"Livestock, predominantly ruminants such as cattle and sheep,
are important sources of CH,, accounting for about one-third of
global anthropogenic emissions of this gas (US-EPA, 2006a).
The methane is produced primarily by enteric fermentation
and voided by eructation (Crutzen, 1995; Murray et al., 1976;
Kennedy and Milligan, 1978). All livestock generate N,O
emissions from manure as a result of excretion of N in urine
and faeces. Practices for reducing CH, and N,O emissions from
this source fall into three general categories: improved feeding
practices, use of specific agents or dietary additives; and longer-
term management changes and animal breeding (Soliva et al.,
2006; Monteny et a/., 2006).
"	Text
"a.

Improved feeding practices: Methane emissions can be
reduced by feeding more concentrates, normally replac-
ing forages (Blaxter and Claperton, 1965; Johnson and
Johnson, 1995; Lovett et al., 2003; Beauchemin and
McGinn, 2005). Although concentrates may increase
daily methane emissions per animal, emissions per kg-
feed intake and per kg-product are almost invariably re-
duced. The magnitude of this reduction per kg-product
decreases as production increases. The net benefit of con-
centrates, however, depends on reduced animal numbers
or younger age at slaughter for beef animals, and on how
the practice affects land use, the N content of manure
and emissions from producing and transporting the con-
centrates (Phetteplace et al., 2001; Lovett et al., 2006).
Other practices that can reduce CH, emissions include: add-
ing certain oils or oilseeds to the diet (e.g., Machmiiller et
al., 2000; Jordan et al., 2006c); improving pasture quality,
especially in less developed regions, because this improves
animal productivity, and reduces the proportion of energy
lost as CH, (Leng, 1991; McCrabb et al., 1998; Alcock and
Hegarty, 2006); and optimizing protein intake to reduce N
excretion and N,O emissions (Clark et al., 2005).
"	List
"¢ Halogenated compounds inhibit methanogenic bacteria
(Wolin et al., 1964; Van Nevel and Demeyer, 1995) but
their effects, too, are often transitory and they can have
side-effects such as reduced intake.

* Novel plant compounds such as condensed tannins
(Pinares-Patifio et al., 2003; Hess et al., 2006), saponins
(Lila et al., 2003) or essential oils (Patra et al., 2006;
Kamra et al., 2006) may have merit in reducing methane
emissions, but these responses may often be obtained
through reduced digestibility of the diet.

* Probiotics, such as yeast culture, have shown only small,
insignificant effects (McGinn et al., 2004), but selecting
strains specifically for methane-reducing ability could
improve results (Newbold and Rode, 2006).

¢ Propionate precursors such as fumarate or malate reduce
methane formation by acting as alternative hydrogen
acceptors (Newbold ef al., 2002). But as response is
elicited only at high doses, propionate precursors are,
therefore, expensive (Newbold et al., 2005).

¢ Vaccines against methanogenic bacteria are being
developed but are not yet available commercially (Wright
et al., 2004).

¢ Bovine somatotropin (bST) and hormonal growth
implants do not specifically suppress CH, formation,
but by improving animal performance (Bauman, 1992;
Schmidely, 1993), they can reduce emissions per-kg of
animal product (Johnson et al., 1991; McCrabb, 2001).

Longer-term management changes and animal breeding:
Increasing productivity through breeding and better man-
agement practices, such as a reduction in the number of
replacement heifers, often reduces methane output per unit
of animal product (Boadi ef a/., 2004). Although selecting
cattle directly for reduced methane production has been
proposed (Kebreab et al., 2006), it is still impractical due
to difficulties in accurately measuring methane emissions
at a magnitude suitable for breeding programmes. With im-
proved efficiency, meat-producing animals reach slaughter
weight at a younger age, with reduced lifetime emissions
(Lovett and O’Mara, 2002). However, the whole-system
effects of such practices may not always lead to reduced
emissions. For example in dairy cattle, intensive selection
for higher yield may reduce fertility, requiring more re-
placement heifers in the herd (Lovett et a/., 2006).

"Increasingly, agricultural crops and residues are seen as
sources of feedstocks for energy to displace fossil fuels. A wide
range of materials have been proposed for use, including grain,

Paustian et al., 2004; Sheehan et al., 2004; Dias de Oliveira
et al., 2005; Eidman, 2005). These products can be burned
directly, but can also be processed further to generate liquid
fuels such as ethanol or diesel fuel (Richter, 2004). Such fuels
release CO, when burned, but this CO, is of recent atmospheric
origin (via photosynthetic carbon uptake) and displaces CO,
which otherwise would have come from fossil carbon. The net
benefit to atmospheric CO;, however, depends on energy used

"energy source (Clemens and Ahlgrimm, 2001; Clemens et al.,
2006). Handling manures in solid form (e.g., composting)
rather than liquid form can suppress CH, emissions, but may
increase N,O formation (Paustian et al., 2004). Preliminary
evidence suggests that covering manure heaps can reduce N,O
emissions, but the effect of this practice on CH, emissions is
variable (Chadwick, 2005). For most animals, worldwide there
is limited opportunity for manure management, treatment, or
storage; excretion happens in the field and handling for fuel
or fertility amendment occurs when it is dry and methane
emissions are negligible (Gonzalez-Avalos and Ruiz-Suarez,
2001). To some extent, emissions from manure might be
curtailed by altering feeding practices (Killing et al., 2003;
Hindrichsen et al., 2006; Kreuzer and Hindrichsen, 2006), or by
composting the manure (Pattey et al., 2005; Amon et al., 2001),
but if aeration is inadequate CH, emissions during composting
can still be substantial (Xu et al., 2007). All of these practices
require further study from the perspective of their impact on

whole life-cycle GHG emissions.

Notes:
The estimates represent average change in soil carbon stocks (CO,) or emissions of N,O and CH, on a per hectare basis. Positive values represent CO, uptake which increases the soil carbon sto
or a reduction in emissions of N,O and CH,.
Estimates of soil carbon storage (CO, mitigation) for all practices except management of organic soils were derived from about 200 studies (see IPCC, 2006, Grassland and Cropland Chapters
Volume IV, Annexes 5A and 6A) using a linear mixed-effect modelling approach, which is a standard linear regression technique with the inclusion of random effects due to dependencies in di
from the same country, site and time series (Ogle et al., 2004, 2005; IPCC, 2006; Smith et al., 2007b). The studies were conducted in regions throughout the world, but temperate studies were m¢
prevalent leading to smaller uncertainties than for estimates for warm tropical climates. Estimates represent annual soil carbon change rate for a 20-year time horizon in the top 30 cm of the s
Soils under bio-energy crops and agro-forestry were assumed to derive their mitigation potential mainly from cessation of soil disturbance, and given the same estimates as no-till. Management
organic soils was based on emissions under drained conditions from IPCC guidelines (IPCC, 1997). Soil CH, and N,O emission reduction potentials were derived as follows:
a) for organic soils, N,O emissions were based on the median, low and high nutrient status organic soil NO emission factors from the IPCC GPG LULUCF (IPCC, 2003) and CH, emissions wé
based on low, high and median values from Le Mer and Roger (2001);

b) N,O figures for nutrient management were derived using the DAYCENT simulation model, and include both direct emissions from nitrification/denitrification at the site, as well as indirect N
emissions associated with volatilization and leaching/runoff of N that is converted into N,O following atmospheric deposition or in waterways, respectively (US-EPA, 2006b; assuming a N reducti
to 80% of current application);

c) NO figures for tillage and residue management were derived using DAYCENT (US-EPA, 2006b; figures for no till);
d) Rice figures were taken directly from US-EPA (2006b) so are not shown here. Low and high values represent the range of a 95% confidence interval. Table 8.4 has mean and uncertainty
change in soil C, N,O and CH, emissions at the climate region scale, and are not intended for use in assessments at finer scales such as individual farms.

emissions at one site may be less effective or even counter-
productive elsewhere. Similarly, effectiveness of livestock
options also varies regionally (Table 8.5). This means that there
is no universally applicable list of mitigation practices, but that
proposed practices will need to be evaluated for individual
agricultural systems according to the specific climatic, edaphic,
social settings, and historical land use and management.

10 to15% of agricultural land to grow energy crops; with crop

the 95% confidence interval about the mean of 5800 MtCO,-eq/

for the mitigation measure. For soil carbon sequestration (89%
of the total potential), this arises from the mixed linear effects
model used to derive the mitigation potentials. The most
appropriate mitigation response will vary among regions, and
different portfolios of strategies will be developed in different

considering all GHGs together, and Boehm et al. (2004) consider
all GHGs for Canada only for 2008. Smith et al. (2007a) used
per-area or per-animal estimates of mitigation potential for
each GHG and multiplied this by the area available for that
practice in each region. It was not necessary to use baseline
emissions in calculating mitigation potential. US-EPA (2006b)
estimated baseline emissions for 2020 for non-CO, GHGs as
7250 MtCO,-eq in 2020 (see Chapter 11; Table 11.4). Non-
CO, GHG emissions in agriculture are projected to increase by
about 13% from 2000 to 2010 and by 13% from 2010 to 2020

a dynamic cost-effective portfolio of abatement strategies is

up to 411 EJ (A1) for 2050 and possibly increasing after that

below US$ 2/GJ production costs. A recent study (Sims eg al.,
2006) which used lower per-area yield assumptions and bio-
energy crop areas projected by the IMAGE 2.2 model suggested
more modest potentials (22 EJ/yr) by 2025.

"Based on assessment of other studies, Hoogwijk et al.
(2003), indicated that marginal and degraded lands (including
a land surface of 1.7 Gha worldwide) could, be it with lower
productivities and higher production costs, contribute another
60-150 EJ. Differences among studies are largely attributable
to uncertainty in land availability, energy crop yields, and
assumptions on changes in agricultural efficiency. Those with
the largest projected potential assume that not only degraded/
surplus land are used, but also land currently used for food
production (including pasture land, as did Smeets et al., 2007).
"	Text
"Converting the potential biomass production into a mitigation
potential is not straightforward. First, the mitigation potential
is determined by the lowest supply and demand potentials, so
without the full picture (see Chapter 11) no estimate can be
made. Second, any potential from bioenergy use will be counted
towards the potential of the sectors where bioenergy is used
(mainly energy supply and transport). Third, the proportion of
the agricultural biomass supply compared to that from the waste
or forestry sector cannot be specified due to lack of information
on cost curves.
"	Text
"There are various potential impacts of agricultural GHG
mitigation on sustainable development. The impacts of
mitigation activities in agriculture, on the constituents and
determinants of sustainable development are set out in Table
8.8. Broadly, three constituents of sustainable development
have been envisioned as the critical minimum: social, economic,
and environmental factors. Table 8.8 presents the degree and
direction of the likely impact of the mitigation options. The
exact magnitude of the effect, however, depends on the scale
and intensity of the mitigation measures, and the sectors and
policy arena in which they are undertaken.
"	Text
"Agriculture contributes nearly half of the CH, and N,O
emissions (Bhatia et al., 2004) and rice, nutrient, water and
tillage management can help to mitigate these GHGs. By
careful drainage and effective institutional support, irrigation
costs for farmers can also be reduced, thereby improving
economic aspects of sustainable development (Rao, 1994). An
appropriate mix of rice cultivation with livestock, known as
integrated annual crop-animal systems and traditionally found
in West Africa, India and Indonesia and Vietnam, can enhance
net income, improve cultivated agro-ecosystems, and enhance
human well-being (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005).
Such combinations of livestock and cropping, especially for
rice, can improve income generation, even in semi-arid and arid
areas of the world.
"	Text
"Agriculture contributes 4% of global GDP (World Bank,
2003) and provides employment to 1.3 billion people (Dean,
2000). It is a critical sector of the world economy, but uses
more water than any other sector. In low-income countries,
agriculture uses 87% of total extracted water, while this figure
is 74% in middle-income countries and 30% in high-income
countries (World Bank, 2003). There are currently 276 Mha
of irrigated croplands (FAOSTAT, 2006), a five-fold increase
since the beginning of the 20 century. With irrigation
increasing, water management is a serious issue. Through
proper institutions and effective functioning of markets, water
management can be implemented with favourable outcomes
for both environmental and economic goals. There is a greater
need for policy coherence and innovative responses creating a
situation where users are asked to pay the full economic costs of
the water. This has special relevance for developing countries.
Removal of subsidies in the electricity and water sectors might
lead to effective water use in agriculture, through adaptation
of appropriate irrigation technology, such as drip irrigation in
place of tube well irrigation.
"	Text
"Top-down integrated assessment models can give an
estimate of the cost competitiveness of bioenergy mitigation
options relative to one another and to other mitigation options
in achieving specific climate goals. By taking into account the
various bioenergy supplies and demands, these models can
give estimates of the combined contribution of the agriculture,
waste, and forestry sectors to bioenergy mitigation potential.
For achieving long-term climate stabilization targets, the
competitive cost-effective mitigation potential of biomass
energy (primarily from agriculture) in 2030 is estimated to be
70 to 1260 MtCO,-eq/yr (0-13 EJ/yr) at up to 20 US$/t CO,-eq,
and 560-2320 MtCO,-eq/yr (0-21 EJ/yr) at up to 50 US$/tCO,-
eq (Rose et al., 2007, USCCSP, 2006). There are no estimates
for the additional potential from top down models at carbon
prices up to 100 US$/tCO,-eq, but the estimate for prices
above 100 US$/tCO,-eq is 2720 MtCO,-eq/yr (20-45 EJ/yr).
This is of the same order of magnitude as the estimate from
a synthesis of supply and demand presented in Chapter 11,
Section 11.3.1.4. The mitigation potentials estimated by top-
down models represent mitigation of 5-80%, and 20-90% of
all other agricultural mitigation measures combined, at carbon
prices of up to 20, and up to 50 US$/tCO,-eq, respectively.

3 Improves soil fertility may not increase yield so societal and economic impacts uncertain.

All efficiency improvements are positive for sustainability goals and should yield economic benefits even if costs of irrigation are borne by the farmer.

Improved yields would mean better economic returns and less land required for new cropland. Societal impacts likely to benign or positive as no large-scale change

to traditional practices.

Improve soil fertility but less land available for production; potential negative impact on economic returns.

Likely environmental benefits, less travel required for fuelwood; positive societal benefits; economic impact uncertain.

Improved production would mean better economic returns and less land required for grazing; lower degradation. Societal effects likely to be positive.

Organic soil restoration has a host of biodiversity/environmental co-benefits but opportunity cost of crop production lost from this land; economic impact depends

upon whether farmers receive payment for the GHG emission reduction.

10 Restoration of degraded lands will provide higher yields and economic returns, less new cropland and provide societal benefits via production stability.

11 Likely environmental benefits though some negative impacts possible (e.g., water pollution) but, depending on the bio-solid system implemented, could increase
costs.

12 Bio-energy crops could yield environmental co-benefits or could lead to loss of bio-diversity (depending on the land use they replace). Economic impact uncertain.
Social benefits could arise from diversified income stream.

13 Negative/uncertain societal impacts as these practices may not be acceptable due to prevailing cultural practices especially in developing countries. Could improve

Similar figures were derived by Freibauer ef al. (2004) and the

projects with positive drought preparedness aspects) or (b)
negative adaptation consequences (e.g., if heavy dependence
on biomass energy increases the sensitivity of energy supply
to climatic extremes; see Chapter 12, Subsection 12.1.4).
Adaptation-driven actions also may have both (a) positive
consequences for mitigation (e.g., residue return to fields to
improve water holding capacity will also sequester carbon);

use of nitrogen fertilizer to overcome falling yield leading to

"The other mitigation measures listed in Table 8.8 are
context- and location-specific in their influence on sustainable
development constituents. Appropriate adoption of mitigation
measures is likely in many cases to help achieve environmental
goals, but farmers may incur additional costs, reducing their
returns and income. This trade-off would be most visible
in the short term, but in the long term, synergy amongst the
constituents of sustainable development would emerge through
improved natural capital. Trade-offs between economic and
environmental aspects of sustainable development might
become less important if the environmental gains were better
acknowledged, quantified, and incorporated in the decision-
making framework.

"Large-scale production of modern bioenergy crops, partly for
export, could generate income and employment for rural regions
of world. Nevertheless, these benefits will not necessarily flow
to the rural populations that need them most. The net impacts
for a region as a whole, including possible changes and
improvements in agricultural production methods should be
considered when developing biomass and bioenergy production
capacity. Although experience around the globe (e.g., Brazil,
India biofuels) shows that major socioeconomic benefits can
be achieved, new bioenergy production schemes could benefit
from the involvement of the regional stakeholders, particularly
the farmers. Experience with such schemes needs to be built
around the globe.
"	Text
"For mitigation, variables such as growth rates for bioenergy
feedstocks, the size of livestock herds, and rates of carbon
sequestration in agricultural lands are affected by climate
change (Paustian ef al., 2004). The extent depends on the
sign and magnitude of changes in temperature, soil moisture,
and atmospheric CO, concentration, which vary regionally
(Christensen et al., 2007). All of these factors will alter the
mitigation potential; some positively and some negatively.
For example: (a) lower growth rates in bioenergy feedstocks
will lead to larger emissions from hauling and increased cost;
(b) lower livestock growth rates would possibly increase
herd size and consequent emissions from manure and enteric
fermentation; and (c) increased microbial decomposition
under higher temperatures will lower soil carbon sequestration
potential. Interactions also occur with adaptation. Butt et al.
(2006) and Reilly et al. (2001) found that modified crop mix,
land use, and irrigation are all potential adaptations to warmer
climates. All would alter the mitigation potential. Some of
the key vulnerabilities of agricultural mitigation strategies to
climate change, and the implications of adaptation on GHG
emissions from agriculture are summarized in Table 8.9.

manure management), agricultural soils (including nutrient and
soil management strategies), savannas, and planted forests. The
Greenhouse Challenge Plus programme and other partnership
initiatives between the Government and industry are facilitating
the integration of GHG abatement measures into agricultural
management systems.

"Agricultural GHG ofisets can be encouraged by market-
based trading schemes. Offset trading, or trading of credits,
allows farmers to obtain credits for reducing their GHG emission
reductions. The primary agricultural project types include
CH, capture and destruction, and soil carbon sequestration.
Although not included in current projects, measures to
reduce N,O emissions could be included in the future. The
vast majority of agricultural projects have focused on CH,
reduction from livestock wastes in North America (Canada,
Mexico and the United States), South America (Brazil), China,
and Eastern Europe. Most of these projects have resulted in the
production of Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) from the
CDM. Credits are bought and sold through the use of offset
aggregators, brokers, and traders. Although the CDM does not
currently support soil carbon sequestration projects, emerging
markets in Canada and the United States are supporting offset
trading from soil carbon sequestration. In Canada, farm groups
such as the Saskatchewan Soil Conservation Association
(SSCA) encourage farmers to adopt no-till practices in return
for carbon offset credits. In the USA, the Pacific Northwest
Direct Seed Association offers soil carbon credits generated
from no-till management to an energy company The Chicago
Climate Exchange (CCX) (www.chicagoclimatex.com/) allows
GHG offsets from no-tillage and conversion of cropland to
grasslands to be traded by voluntary action through a market
trading mechanism. These approaches to agriculturally derived
GHG offset will likely expand geographically and in scope.
Policy instruments are detailed in Chapter 13 (Section 13.2).

forest and grassland in Vulnerable Ecological Zones under the
UN Convention on Desertification. This will increase carbon

"Transaction costs: Under an incentive-based system such as
a carbon market, the amount of money farmers receive is not the
market price, but the market price less brokerage cost. This may
be substantial, and is an increasing fraction as the amount of
carbon involved diminishes, creating a serious entry barrier for
"	Text
"Reversibility: A subsequent change in management can
reverse the gains in carbon sequestration over a similar period
of time. Not all agricultural mitigation options are reversible;
reduction in N,O and CH, emissions, avoided emissions as a
result of agricultural energy efficiency gains or substitution of
fossil fuels by bio-energy are non-reversible.
"	Text
"Baseline: The GHG net emission reductions need to be
assessed relative to a baseline. Selection of an appropriate
baseline to measure management-induced soil carbon changes
is still an obstacle in some mitigation projects. The extent of
practices already in place in project regions will need to be
determined for the baseline.
"	Text
"Displacement of Emissions: Adopting certain agricultural
mitigation practices may reduce production within implementing
regions, which, in turn, may be offset by increased production
outside the project region unconstrained by GHG mitigation
objectives, reducing the net emission reductions. ‘Wall-to-wall’
accounting can detect this, and crediting correction factors may
need to be employed (Murray et al., 2004; US-EPA, 2005).
"	Text
"Maximum Storage: Carbon sequestration in soils or terrestrial
biomass has a maximum capacity for the ecosystem, which
may be reached after 15 to 60 years, depending on management
practice, management history, and the system (West and
Post, 2002). However, sequestration is a rapidly and cheaply
deployable mitigation option, until more capital-intensive
developments, and longer-lasting actions become available
(Caldeira et al., 2004; Sands and McCarl, 2005).
"	Text
"Many policies other than climate policies affect GHG emis-
sions from agriculture. These include other UN conventions
such as Biodiversity, Desertification and actions on Sustain-
able Development (see Section 8.4.5), macroeconomic policy
such as EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)/CAP reform,
international free trade agreements, trading blocks, trade bar-
riers, region-specific programmes, energy policy and price
adjustment, and other environmental policies including vari-
ous environmental/agro-environmental schemes. These are
described further below.
"	Text
"Other barriers: Other possible barriers to implementation
include the availability of capital, the rate of capital stock
turnover, the rate of technological development, risk attitudes,
need for research and outreach, consistency with traditional
practices, pressure for competing uses of agricultural land and
water, demand for agricultural products, high costs for certain
enabling technologies (e.g., soil tests before fertilization), and
ease of compliance (e.g., straw burning is quicker than residue
removal and can also control some weeds and diseases, so
farmers favour straw burning).
"	Text
"Uncertainty: This has two components: mechanism
uncertainty and measurement uncertainty. Uncertainty about
the complex biological and ecological processes involved in
GHG emissions and carbon storage in agricultural systems
makes investors more wary of these options than of more clear-
cut industrial mitigation activities. This barrier can be reduced
by investment in research. Secondly, agricultural systems
exhibit substantial variability between seasons and locations,
creating high variability in offset quantities at the farm level.
This variability can be reduced by increasing the geographical
extent and duration of the accounting unit (e.g., multi-region,
multi-year contracts; Kim and McCarl, 2005).
"	Text
"Measurement and monitoring costs: Mooney et al. (2004)
argue that such costs are likely to be small (under 2% of the
contract), but other studies disagree (Smith, 2004c). In general,
measurement costs per carbon-credit sold decrease as the
quantity of carbon sequestered and area sampled increase.
Methodological advances in measuring soil carbon may reduce
costs and increase the sensitivity of change detection. However,
improved methods to account for changes in soil bulk density
remain a hindrance to quantification of changes in soil carbon
stocks (Izaurralde and Rice, 2006). Development of remote
sensing, new spectral techniques to measure soil carbon, and
modelling offer opportunities to reduce costs but will require
evaluation (Izaurralde and Rice, 2006, Brown et al., 2006; Ogle
and Paustian, 2005; Gehl and Rice, 2007).

"to the latter. Since agricultural practices and GHG emissions
per unit product differ between countries, such displacement
may also cause changes in total emissions from agriculture.
In addition, the increase in international flow of agricultural
products which may result from trade liberalization could cause
higher GHG emissions from the use of transport fuels.
"	Text
"In all regions, policies to improve other aspects of the
environment have been more effective in reducing GHG
emissions from agriculture than policies aimed specifically at
reducing agricultural GHG emissions (see Section 8.6.1). The
importance of identifying these co-benefits when formulating
climate and other environmental policy is addressed in Section
8.8.
"	Text
"In most world regions, environmental policies have been put
in place to improve fertility, to reduce erosion and soil loss,
and to improve agricultural efficiency. The majority of these
environmental policies also reduce GHG emissions. Various
environmental policies not implemented specifically to address
GHG emissions but potentially affect agricultural GHG
emissions in each major world region are presented in Table
8.11.
"	Text
"WTO negotiations, to the extent they move toward free trade,
would permit countries to better adjust to climate change and
the dislocations in production caused by mitigation activities,
by adjusting their import/export mix. International trade
agreements such as WTO may also have impacts on the amount
and geographical distribution of GHG emissions. If agricultural
subsidies are reduced and markets become more open, a shift
in production from developed to developing countries would be
expected, with the consequent displacement of GHG emissions
"	Text
"Many of the measures aimed at reducing GHG emissions
have other impacts on the productivity and environmental
integrity of agricultural ecosystems, mostly positive (Table
8.12). These measures are often adopted mainly for reasons other
than GHG mitigation (see Section 8.7.3). Agro-ecosystems are
inherently complex and very few practices yield purely win-
win outcomes; most involve some trade-offs (DeFries ef al.,
2004; Viner et al., 2006) above certain levels or intensities of
implementation. Specific examples of co-benefits and trade-
offs among agricultural GHG mitigation measures include:
"	Text
"Practices that maintain or increase crop productivity can
improve global or regional food security (Lal, 2004a, b;
Follett et al., 2005). This co-benefit may become more im-
portant as global food demands increase in coming decades
(Sanchez and Swaminathan, 2005; Rosegrant and Cline,
2003; FAO, 2003; Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,
2005). Building reserves of soil carbon often also increases
the potential productivity of these soils. Furthermore, many
of the measures that promote carbon sequestration also
prevent degradation by avoiding erosion and improving
soil structure. Consequently, many carbon conserving prac-
tices sustain or enhance future fertility, productivity and
resilience of soil resources (Lal, 2004a; Cerri et al., 2004;
Freibauer et al., 2004; Paustian et al., 2004; Kurkalova
"	List
"on Biodiversity, China has initiated a programme that restores
croplands close to lakes, the sea, or other natural lands as
conservation zones for wildlife. This may increase soil carbon
sequestration but, if restored to wetland, could increase CH,
emissions. InsupportofUN Sustainable Development guidelines,
China has introduced a Land Reclamation Regulation (1988) in
which land degraded by, for example, construction or mining is
restored for use in agriculture, thereby increasing soil carbon
storage. In Europe (including Eastern Europe, the Caucasus
and Central Asia) and North America, the UN conventions have
had few significant impacts on agricultural GHG emissions. In
Europe, the UN Convention on Long Range Trans-boundary
Air Pollutants also leads to regulations to control air pollutants
(e.g., by regulating N emissions) that could have substantial
impacts on emission reductions in the agricultural sector.
"	Text
"Some macro-economic changes, such as the burden of a
high external debt in Latin America, triggered the adoption in
the 1970s of policies designed for improving the trade balance,
mainly by promoting agricultural exports (Tejo, 2004). This
resulted in the changes in land use and management (see
Section 8.3.3), which are still causing increases in annual
GHG emissions today. In other regions, such as the countries
of Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia and many
Central and East European countries, political changes since
1990 have meant agricultural de-intensification with less inputs,
and land abandonment, leading to a decrease in agricultural
GHG emissions. In Africa, the cultivated area in Southern Africa
has increased by 30% since 1960, while agricultural production
has doubled (Scholes and Biggs, 2004). The macroeconomic
development framework for Africa (NEPAD, 2005) emphasises
agriculture-led development. It is, therefore, anticipated that the
cropped area will continue to increase, especially in Central,
East, and Southern Africa, perhaps at an accelerating rate. In
Western Europe, North America, Asia (China) and Oceania,
macroeconomic policy has tended to reduce GHG emissions.
The declining emission trend in Western Europe is likely a
consequence of successive reforms of the Common Agricultural
Policy (CAP) since 1992. The 2003 EU CAP reform is expected
to lead to further reductions, mainly through reduction of animal
numbers (Binfield et al., 2006). The reduced GHG emissions
could be offset by activity elsewhere. Various macro-economic
policies that potentially affect agricultural GHG emissions in
each major world region are presented in Table 8.10.

"8.9 Technology research, development,
deployment, diffusion and transfer
"	Title
"There is much scope for technological developments to
reduce GHG emissions in the agricultural sector. For example,
increases in crop yields and animal productivity will reduce
emissions per unit of production. Such increases in crop and
animal productivity will be implemented through improved
management and husbandry techniques, such as better
management, genetically modified crops, improved cultivars,
fertilizer recommendation systems, precision agriculture,
improved animal breeds, improved animal nutrition, dietary
additives and growth promoters, improved animal fertility, bio-
energy crops, anaerobic slurry digestion and methane capture
"	Text
"The co-benefits and trade-offs of a practice may vary from
place to place because of differences in climate, soil, or the way
the practice is adopted. In producing bio-energy, for example,
if the feedstock is crop residue, that may reduce soil quality by
depleting soil organic matter. Conversely, if the feedstock is a
densely rooted perennial crop that may replenish organic matter
and thereby improve soil quality (Paustian et a/., 2004).These
few examples, and the general trends described in Table 8.12,
demonstrate that GHG mitigation practices on farm lands exert
complex, interactive effects on the environment, sometimes far
from the site at which they are imposed. The merits of a given
practice, therefore, cannot be judged solely on effectiveness of
GHG mitigation.
"	Text
"Conversely, increasing productivity on existing croplands
may ‘spare’ some forest or grasslands (West and Marland,
2003; Balmford et al., 2005; Mooney et al., 2005). The net
effect of such trade-offs on biodiversity and other ecosys-
tem services has not yet been fully quantified (Huston and
Marland, 2003; Green et al., 2005).

Agro-ecosystems have become increasingly dependent on
input of reactive nitrogen, much of it added as manufac-
tured fertilizers (Galloway et al., 2003; Galloway, 2004).
Practices that reduce N,O emission often improve the
efficiency of N use from these and other sources (e.g.,
manures), thereby also reducing GHG emissions from
fertilizer manufacture and avoiding deleterious effects

on water and air quality from N pollutants (Oenema et
al., 2005; Dalal et al., 2003; Olesen et al., 2006; Paustian
et al., 2004). Suppressing losses of N as N,O might in
some cases increase the risk of losing that N via leaching.
Curtailing supplemental N use without a corresponding
increase in N-use efficiency will restrict yields, thereby
hampering food security.

Implementation of agricultural GHG mitigation measures
may allow expanded use of fossil fuels, and may have
some negative effects through emissions of sulphur, mer-
cury and other pollutants (Elbakidze and McCarl, 2007).
"	List
"et al., L004, Diaz-Zorita ef al., ZUUzZ). In some instances,
where productivity is enhanced through increased inputs,
there may be risks of soil depletion through mechanisms
such as acidification or salinization (Barak et al., 1997;
Diez et al., 2004; Connor, 2004).

A key potential trade-off is between the production of bio-
energy crops and food security. To the extent that bio-ener-
gy production uses crop residues, excess agricultural prod-
ucts or surplus land and water, there will be little resultant
loss of food production. But above this point, proportional
losses of food production will be strongly negative. Food
insecurity is determined more by inequity of access to food
(at all scales) than by absolute food production insufficien-
cies, so the impact of this trade-off depends among other
things on the economic distributional effects of bio-energy
production.

Fresh water is a dwindling resource in many parts of the
world (Rosegrant and Cline, 2003; Rockstrém, 2003).
Agricultural practices for mitigation of GHGs can have
both negative and positive effects on water conservation,
and on water quality. Where measures promote water use
efficiency (e.g., reduced tillage), they provide potential
benefits. But in some cases, the practices could intensify
water use, thereby reducing stream flow or groundwater
reserves (Unkovich, 2003; Dias de Oliveira et a/., 2005).
For instance, high-productivity, evergreen, deep-rooted
bio-energy plantations generally have a higher water use
than the land cover they replace (Berndes, 2002, Jackson et
al., 2005). Some practices may affect water quality through
enhanced leaching of pesticides and nutrients (Freibauer et
al., 2004; Machado and Silva, 2001).

If bio-energy plantations are appropriately located, de-
signed, and managed, they may reduce nutrient leaching
and soil erosion and generate additional environmental
services such as soil carbon accumulation, improved soil
fertility; removal of cadmium and other heavy metals from
soils or wastes. They may also increase nutrient recircula-
tion, aid in the treatment of nutrient-rich wastewater and
sludge; and provide habitats for biodiversity in the agricul-
tural landscape (Berndes and Bérjesson, 2002; Berndes et
al. 2004; Borjesson and Berndes, 2006).

Changes to land use and agricultural management can
affect biodiversity, both positively and negatively (e.g.,
Xiang et al., 2006; Feng et al., 2006). For example,
intensification of agriculture and large-scale production

of biomass energy crops will lead to loss of biodiversity
where they occur in biodiversity-rich landscapes (Euro-
pean Environment Agency, 2006). But perennial crops
often used for energy production can favour biodiversity, if
they displace annual crops or degraded areas (Berndes and
Borjesson, 2002).

Agricultural mitigation practices may influence non-agri-
cultural ecosystems. For example, practices that diminish
productivity in existing cropland (e.g., set-aside lands) or
divert products to alternate uses (e.g., bio-energy crops)
may induce conversion of forests to cropland elsewhere.

8.10 Long-term outlook
"	Title
"Some countries are moving forward with climate and non-
climate policies, particularly those linked with sustainable
development and improving environmental quality as described
in Sections 8.6 and 8.7. These policies will likely have direct
or synergistic effects on GHG emissions and provide a way
forward for mitigation in the agricultural sector. Moreover,
global sharing of innovative technologies for efficient use of
land resources and agricultural inputs, in an effort to eliminate
poverty and malnutrition, will also enhance the likelihood of
significant mitigation from the agricultural sector.
"	Text
"Differences between regions can arise due to the state of
development of the agricultural industry, the resources available
and legislation. For example, the scope to use specific agents and
dietary additives in ruminants is much greater in developed than
in the developing regions because of cost, opportunity (e.g., it
is easier to administer products to animals in confined systems
than in free ranging or nomadic systems), and availability of the
technology (US-EPA, 2006a). Furthermore, certain technologies
are not allowed in some regions, for example, ionophores are
banned from use in animal feeding in the EU, and genetically
modified crops are not approved for use in some countries.
"	Text
"Mitigation of GHG emissions associated with various
agricultural activities and soil carbon sequestration could be
achieved through best management practices, many of which
are currently available for implementation. Best management
practices are not only essential for mitigating GHG emissions,
but also for other facets of environmental protection such as
air and water quality management. Uncertainties do exist, but
they can be reduced through finer scale assessments of best
management practices within countries, evaluating not only the
GHG mitigation potential but also the influences of mitigation
options on socio-economic conditions and other environmental
impacts.
"	Text
"In most instances, the cost of employing mitigation strategies
will not alter radically in the medium term. There will be some
shifts in costs due to changes in prices of agricultural products
and inputs, but these are unlikely to be of significant magnitude.
Likewise, the potential of most options for CO, reduction is
unlikely to change greatly. There are some exceptions which
fall into two categories: (i) options where the practice or
technology is not new, but where the emission reduction
potential has not been adequately quantified, such as improved
nutrient utilization; and (ii) options where technologies are still
being refined such as probiotics in animal diets, or nitrification
inhibitors.
"	Text
"Many of the mitigation strategies outlined for agriculture
employ existing technology (e.g., crop management, livestock
management). With such strategies, the main issue is technology
transfer, diffusion, and deployment. Other strategies involve
new use of existing technologies. For example, oils have been
used in animal diets for many years to increase dietary energy
content, but their role as a methane suppressant is relatively
new, and the parameters of the technology in terms of scope for
methane reduction are only now being defined. Other strategies
still require further research to allow viable systems to operate
(e.g., bio-energy crops). Finally, many novel mitigation strategies
are presently being refined, such as the use of probiotics, novel
plant extracts, and the development of vaccines. Thus, there is
still a major role for research and development in this area.
"	Text
"systems. All of these depend to some extent on technological
developments. Although technological improvement may have
very significant effects, transfer of these technologies is a key
requirement for these mitigations to be realized. For example,
the efficiency of N use has improved over the last two decades
in developed countries, but continues to decline in many
developing countries due to barriers to technology transfer
(International Fertilizer Industry Association, 2007). Based on
technology change scenarios developed by Ewert et al. (2005),
and derived from extrapolation of current trends in FAO data,
Smith et al. (2005b) showed that technological improvements
could potentially counteract the negative impacts of climate
change on cropland and grassland soil carbon stocks in
Europe. This and other work (Rounsevell et a/., 2006) suggest
that technological improvement will be a key factor in GHG
mitigation in the future.
"	Text
"Trends in GHG emissions in the agricultural sector depend
mainly on the level and rate of socio-economic development,
human population growth, and diet, application of adequate
technologies, climate and non-climate policies, and future
climate change. Consequently, mitigation potentials in the
agricultural sector are uncertain, making a consensus difficult
to achieve and hindering policy making. However, agriculture
is a significant contributor to GHG emissions (Section 8.2).
Mitigation is unlikely to occur without action, and higher
emissions are projected in the future if current trends are left
unconstrained. According to current projections, the global
population will reach 9 billion by 2050, an increase of about
50% over current levels (Lutz et al., 2001; Cohen, 2003).
Because of these increases and changing consumption patterns,
some analyses estimate that the production of cereals will need
to roughly double in coming decades (Tilman ef al., 2001; Roy
et al., 2002; Green et al., 2005). Achieving these increases in
food production may require more use of N fertilizer, leading
to possible increases in N,O emissions, unless more efficient
fertilization techniques and products can be found (Galloway,
2003; Mosier, 2002). Greater demands for food could also
increase CH, emissions from enteric fermentation if livestock
numbers increase in response to demands for meat and other
livestock products. As projected by the IMAGE 2.2 model,
CO,, CH4, and N,O emissions associated with land use vary
greatly between scenarios (Strengers et al., 2004), depending
on trends towards globalization or regionalization, and on the
emphasis placed on material wealth relative to sustainability
and equity.
"	Text
"Overall, the outlook for GHG mitigation in agriculture
suggests significant potential. Current initiatives suggest
that identifying synergies between climate change policies,
sustainable development, and improvement of environmental
quality will likely lead the way forward to realization of
mitigation potential in this sector.

"stored soil carbon into the atmosphere (Knorr et al., 2005;
Fang et al., 2005; Smith et al. 2005b). Furthermore, changes in
precipitation patterns could change the adaptability of crops or
cropping systems selected to reduce GHG emissions. Many of
these effects have high levels of uncertainty; but demonstrate
that practices chosen to reduce GHG emissions may not have
the same effectiveness in coming decades. Consequently,
programmes to reduce emissions in the agricultural sector will
need to be designed with flexibility for adaptation in response
to climate change.
"	Text
"Recycling of agricultural by-products, such as crop residues
and animal manures, and production of energy crops provides
opportunities for direct mitigation of GHG emissions from
fossil fuel offsets. However, there are barriers in technologies
and economics to using agricultural wastes, and in converting
energy crops into commercial fuels. The development of
innovative technologies is a critical factor in realizing the
potential for biofuel production from agricultural wastes and
energy crops. This mitigation option could be moved forward
with government investment for the development of these
technologies, and subsidies for using these forms of energy.
"	Text
"A number of agricultural mitigation options which have
limited potential now will likely have increased potential in
the long-term. Examples include better use of fertilizer through
precision farming, wider use of slow and controlled release
fertilizers and of nitrification inhibitors, and other practices
that reduce N application (and thus N,O emissions). Similarly,
enhanced N-use efficiency is achievable as technologies such
as field diagnostics, fertilizer recommendations from expert/
decision support systems and fertilizer placement technologies
are developed and more widely used. New fertilizers and water
management systems in paddy rice are also likely in the longer
term.
"	Text
"The long-term outlook for development of mitigation
practices for livestock systems is encouraging. Continuous
improvements in animal breeds are likely, and these will
improve the GHG emissions per kg of animal product. Enhanced
production efficiency due to structural change or better
application of existing technologies is also generally associated
with reduced emissions, and there is a trend towards increased
efficiency in both developed and developing countries. New
technologies may emerge to reduce emissions from livestock
such as probiotics, a methane vaccine or methane inhibitors.
However, increased world demand for animal products may
mean that while emissions per kg of product decline, total
emissions may increase.
"	Text
"Possible changes to climate and atmosphere in coming
decades may influence GHG emissions from agriculture, and
the effectiveness of practices adopted to minimize them. For
example, atmospheric CO, concentrations, likely to double
within the next century, may affect agro-ecosystems through
changes in plant growth rates, plant litter composition, drought
tolerance, and nitrogen demands (e.g., Long ef al., 2006;
Henry et al., 2005; Van Groenigen et al., 2005; Jensen and
Christensen, 2004; Torbert et al., 2000; Norby et al., 2001).
Similarly, atmospheric nitrogen deposition also affects crop
production systems as well as changing temperature regimes,
although the effect will depend on the magnitude of change and
response of the crop, forage, or livestock species. For example,
increasing temperatures are likely to have a positive effect on
crop production in colder regions due to a longer growing season
(Smith et a/., 2005b). In contrast, increasing temperatures could
accelerate decomposition of soil organic matter, releasing

"In the long term, a sustainable forest management strategy

producing an annual sustained yield of timber, fibre or energy
from the forest, will generate the largest sustained mitigation
benefit. Most mitigation activities require up-front investment
with benefits and co-benefits typically accruing for many years

"Global change will impact carbon mitigation in the forest
sector but the magnitude and direction of this impact cannot
be predicted with confidence as yet. Global change may affect
growth and decomposition rates, the area, type, and intensity
of natural disturbances, land-use patterns, and other ecological
processes (medium agreement, medium evidence).

"Forestry can make a very significant contribution to a
low-cost global mitigation portfolio that provides synergies
with adaptation and sustainable development. However, this
opportunity is being lost in the current institutional context and
lack of political will to implement and has resulted in only a
small portion of this potential being realized at present (high
agreement, much evidence).

"Forestry mitigation activities implemented under the Kyoto
Protocol, including the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM),
have to date been limited. Opportunities to increase activities
include simplifying procedures, developing certainty over
future commitments, reducing transaction costs, and building
confidence and capacity among potential buyers, investors and
project participants (high agreement, medium evidence).

"The carbon mitigation potentials from reducing deforestation,
forest management, afforestation, and agro-forestry differ
greatly by activity, regions, system boundaries and the time
horizon over which the options are compared. In the short
term, the carbon mitigation benefits of reducing deforestation
are greater than the benefits of afforestation. That is because
deforestation is the single most important source, with a net loss
of forest area between 2000 and 2005 of 7.3 million ha/yr.

"Mitigation options by the forestry sector include extending
carbon retention in harvested wood products, product
substitution, and producing biomass for bio-energy. This
carbon is removed from the atmosphere and is available to meet
society’s needs for timber, fibre, and energy. Biomass from
forestry can contribute 12-74 EJ/yr to energy consumption,
with a mitigation potential roughly equal to 0.4-4.4 GtCO,/yr
depending on the assumption whether biomass replaces coal or
gas in power plants (medium agreement, medium evidence).
"	Text
"During the last decade of the 20% century, deforestation in
the tropics and forest regrowth in the temperate zone and parts
of the boreal zone remained the major factors responsible for
emissions and removals, respectively. However, the extent to
which the carbon loss due to tropical deforestation is offset
by expanding forest areas and accumulating woody biomass
in the boreal and temperate zones is an area of disagreement
between land observations and estimates by top-down models.
Emissions from deforestation in the 1990s are estimated at 5.8
GtCO,/yr (medium agreement, medium evidence).
"	Text
"Realization of the mitigation potential requires institutional
capacity, investment capital, technology RD and transfer, as
well as appropriate policies and incentives, and international
cooperation. In many regions, their absence has been a barrier
to implementation of forestry mitigation activities. Notable
exceptions exist, however, such as regional successes in
reducing deforestation rates and implementing large-scale
afforestation programmes. Considerable progress has been made
in technology development for implementation, monitoring and
reporting of carbon benefits but barriers to technology transfer
remain (high agreement, much evidence).

"Globally, hundreds of millions of households depend
on goods and services provided by forests. This underlines
the importance of assessing forest sector activities aimed at
mitigating climate change in the broader context of sustainable
development and community impact. Forestry mitigation
activities can be designed to be compatible with adapting to
climate change, maintaining biodiversity, and promoting
sustainable development. Comparing environmental and social
co-benefits and costs with the carbon benefit will highlight trade-
offs and synergies, and help promote sustainable development
(low agreement, medium evidence).

"Bottom-up regional studies show that forestry mitigation
options have the economic potential at costs up to 100 US$/
tCO-eq to contribute 1.3-4.2 GtCO,-eq/yr (average 2.7 GtCO-
eq/yr) in 2030. About 50% can be achieved at a cost under 20
US$/tCO,.eq (around 1.6 GtCO,/yr) with large differences
between regions. Global top-down models predict far higher
mitigation potentials of 13.8 GtCO,-eq/yr in 2030 at carbon
prices less than or equal to 100 US$/tCO,-eq. Regional studies
tend to use more detailed data and a wider range of mitigation
options are reviewed, Thus, these studies may more accurately
reflect regional circumstances and constraints than simpler,
more aggregate global models. However, regional studies
vary in model structure, coverage, analytical approach, and
assumptions (including baseline assumptions). In the sectoral
comparison in Section 11.3, the more conservative estimate
from regional studies is used. Further research is required
to narrow the gap in the potential estimates from global and
regional assessments (medium agreement, medium evidence).

"In the context of global change and sustainable development,
forest management activities play a key role through mitigation

climate change and their contribution to mitigation strategies
may be influenced by stresses possibly resulting from it. Socio-
economically, global forests are important because many
citizens depend on the goods, services, and financial values
provided by forests. Within this context, mitigation options
have to be sought.

"Forest mitigation options include reducing emissions from
deforestation and forest degradation, enhancing the sequestration
rate in existing and new forests, providing wood fuels as a
substitute for fossil fuels, and providing wood products for more
energy-intensive materials. Properly designed and implemented,
forestry mitigation options will have substantial co-benefits in
terms of employment and income generation opportunities,
biodiversity and watershed conservation, provision of timber

"Since the IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR), new mitigation
estimates have become available from local to global scale
(Sathaye et al., 2007) as well as major economic reviews and

the integration of mitigation and adaptation options and the
linkages to sustainable development (MEA, 2005a). There is
increased attention to reducing emissions from deforestation

"The global forest cover is 3952 million ha (Table 9.1), which
is about 30 percent of the world’s land area (FAO, 2006a). Most
relevant for the carbon cycle is that between 2000 and 2005,
gross deforestation continued at a rate of 12.9 million ha/yr.
This is mainly as a result of converting forests to agricultural
land, but also due to expansion of settlements, infrastructure,
and unsustainable logging practices (FAO, 2006a; MEA, 2005b).
In the 1990s, gross deforestation was slightly higher, at 13.1
million ha/yr. Due to afforestation, landscape restoration and
natural expansion of forests, the most recent estimate of net loss
of forest is 7.3 million ha/yr. The loss is still largest in South
America, Africa and Southeast Asia (Figure 9.1). This net loss
was less than that of 8.9 million ha/yr in the 1990s.

"Basic problems remain. Few major forest-based mitigation
analyses have been conducted using new primary data. There is
still limited insight regarding impacts on soils, lack of integrated
views on the many site-specific studies, hardly any integration
with climate impact studies, and limited views in relation to
social issues and sustainable development. Little new effort
was reported on the development of global baseline scenarios
of land-use change and their associated carbon balance, against
which mitigation options could be examined. There is limited
quantitative information on the cost-benefit ratios of mitigation
interventions. Finally, there are still knowledge gaps in how
forest mitigation activities may alter, for example, surface
hydrology and albedo (IPCC, 2007b: Chapter 4).

Understanding current trends is critical for evaluation of

than any land-based global sink estimate and in the upper range
of estimates produced by inversion of atmospheric transport

"Market-based development of environmental services
from forests, such as biodiversity conservation, carbon

management. Expansion of these markets may remain slow and
depends on government intervention (Katila and Puustjarvi,

behaviour of forest owners may influence roundwood markets
and availability of wood for conventional uses, thus potentially
limiting substitution possibilities.

"Global wood harvest is about 3 billion m? and has been

amount of wood removed is higher, as illegally wood removal is

the rest is wood fuel (including fuelwood and charcoal). The
most wood removal in A frica and substantial proportions in Asia

were collected for the recent global forest resources assessment
(FAO, 2006a). These data indicate globally there are many
good signs and positive trends (intensive forest plantation and
rising conservation efforts), but also negative trends continue
(primary forests continue to become degraded or converted to
agriculture in some regions). Several tools have been developed
in the context of sustainable forest management, including
criteria and indicators, national forest programmes, model
forests and certification schemes. These tools can also support
and provide sound grounds for mitigation of climate change
and thus carbon sequestration.

"Globally during the 1990s, deforestation in the tropics and
forest regrowth in the temperate zone and parts of the boreal
zone were the major factors responsible for emissions and
removals, respectively (Table 9.2; Figure 9.2). However, the
extent to which carbon loss due to tropical deforestation is offset
by expanding forest areas and accumulating woody biomass
in the boreal and temperate zones is the area of disagreement
between land observations and estimates by top-down models.
The top-down methods based on inversion of atmospheric
transport models estimate the net terrestrial carbon sink for the
1990s, which is the balance of sinks in northern latitudes and
source in tropics (Gurney ef al., 2002). The latest estimates are
consistent with the increase found in the terrestrial carbon sink
in the 1990s over the 1980s.

well constrained by available data and consistent across
published results, the rates of tropical deforestation are uncertain

mitigation options is introduced and specific options are briefly
described. Literature results are summarized and compared for
regional bottom-up approaches, global forest sector models, and
global top-down integrated model approaches. The assessment
is limited to CO, balances and economic costs of the various
mitigation options. Broader issues including biodiversity,
sustainable development, and interactions with adaptation
strategies are discussed in subsequent sections.

"The picture emerging from Table 9.2 is complex because
available estimates differ in the land-use types included and in
the use of gross fluxes versus net carbon balance, among other
variables. This makes it impossible to set a widely accepted
baseline for the forestry sector globally. Thus, we had to rely
on the baselines used in each regional study separately (Section
9.4.3.1), or used in each global study (Section 9.4.3.3). However,
this approach creates large uncertainty in assessing the overall
mitigation potential in the forest sector. Baseline CO, emissions
from land-use change and forestry in 2030 are the same as or
slightly lower than in 2000 (see Chapter 3, Figure 3.10).
"	Text
"Attribution of estimated carbon sink in forests to the short-
and long-term effects of the historic land-use change and shifting
natural disturbance patterns on one hand, and to the effects of N
and CO, fertilization and climate change on the other, remains
problematic (Houghton, 2003b). For the USA, for example,
the fraction of carbon sink attributable to changes in land-use
and land management might be as high as 98% (Caspersen
et al., 2000), or as low as 40% (Schimel et al., 2001). Forest
expansion and regrowth and associated carbon sinks were
reported in many regions (Table 9.2; Figure 9.2). The expanding
tree cover in South Western USA is attributed to the long-term
effects of fire control but the gain in carbon storage was smaller
than previously thought. The lack of consensus on factors that
control the carbon balance is an obstacle to development of
effective mitigations strategies.

"Each mitigation activity has a characteristic time sequence
of actions, carbon benefits and costs (Figure 9.4). Relative to
a baseline, the largest short-term gains are always achieved
through mitigation activities aimed at emission avoidance
(e.g., reduced deforestation or degradation, fire protection, and
slash burning). But once an emission has been avoided, carbon
stocks on that forest will merely be maintained or increased
slightly. In contrast, the benefits from afforestation accumulate
over years to decades but require up-front action and expenses.
Most forest management activities aimed at enhancing sinks
require up-front investments. The duration and magnitude of
their carbon benefits differ by region, type of action and initial
condition of the forest. In the long term, sustainable forest
management strategy aimed at maintaining or increasing forest
carbon stocks, while producing an annual yield of timber, fibre,
or energy from the forest, will generate the largest sustained
mitigation benefit.
"	Text
"The design of a forest sector mitigation portfolio should
consider the trade-offs between increasing forest ecosystem
carbon stocks and increasing the sustainable rate of harvest
and transfer of carbon to meet human needs (Figure 9.3). The
selection of forest sector mitigation strategies should minimize
net GHG emissions throughout the forest sector and other
sectors affected by these mitigation activities. For example,
stopping all forest harvest would increase forest carbon stocks,
but would reduce the amount of timber and fibre available to
meet societal needs. Other energy-intensive materials, such
as concrete, aluminium, steel, and plastics, would be required
to replace wood products, resulting in higher GHG emissions
(Gustavsson et al., 2006). Afforestation may affect the net
GHG balance in other sectors, if for example, forest expansion
reduces agricultural land area and leads to farming practices
with higher emissions (e.g., more fertilizer use), conversion of
land for cropland expansion elsewhere, or increased imports of
agricultural products (McCarl and Schneider, 2001). The choice
of system boundaries and time horizons affects the ranking of
mitigation activities (Figure 9.3).

conversion of non-forest to forest land through planting,
seeding, and/or the human-induced promotion of natural seed

afforestation is used to imply either afforestation or reforestation.
To date, carbon sequestration has rarely been the primary driver
of afforestation, but future changes in carbon valuation could
result in large increases in the rates of afforestation (US EPA,
2005).
"	Text
"Reduced deforestation and degradation is the forest
mitigation option with the largest and most immediate carbon
stock impact in the short term per ha and per year globally (see
Section 9.2 and global mitigation assessments below), because
large carbon stocks (about 350-900 tCO,/ha) are not emitted
when deforestation is prevented. The mitigation costs of reduced
deforestation depend on the cause of deforestation (timber or
fuelwood extraction, conversion to agriculture, settlement, or
infrastructure), the associated returns from the non-forest land
use, the returns from potential alternative forest uses, and on any
compensation paid to the individual or institutional landowner
to change land-use practices. These costs vary by country and
region (Sathaye et al., 2007), as discussed below.
"	Text
"Afforestation typically leads to increases in biomass and
dead organic matter carbon pools, and to a lesser extent, in
soil carbon pools, whose small, slow increases are often hard
to detect within the uncertainty ranges (Paul et al., 2003).
Biomass clearing and site preparation prior to afforestation
may lead to short-term carbon losses on that site. On sites with
low initial soil carbon stocks (e.g., after prolonged cultivation),
afforestation can yield considerable soil carbon accumulation
rates (e.g., Post and Kwon (2000) report rates of 1 to 1.5 t CO,/
yr). Conversely, on sites with high initial soil carbon stocks,
(e.g., some grassland ecosystems) soil carbon stocks can decline
following afforestation (e.g., Tate et al. (2005) report that in
the whole of New Zealand soil carbon losses amount up to 2.2
MtCO,/yr after afforestation). Once harvesting of afforested
land commences, forest biomass carbon is transferred into
wood products that store carbon for years to many decades.
Accumulation of carbon in biomass after afforestation varies
greatly by tree species and site, and ranges globally between |
and 35 t CO,/ha.yr (Richards and Stokes, 2004).

"Wood products derived from sustainably managed forests
address the issue of saturation of forest carbon stocks. The
annual harvest can be set equal to or below the annual forest
increment, thus allowing forest carbon stocks to be maintained
or to increase while providing an annual carbon flow to meet
society’s needs of fibre, timber and energy. The duration of
carbon storage in wood products ranges from days (biofuels)
to centuries (e.g., houses and furniture). Large accumulations
of wood products have occurred in landfills (Micales and
Skog, 1997). When used to displace fossil fuels, woodfuels
can provide sustained carbon benefits, and constitute a large
mitigation option (see Box 9.2).

"The available studies about mitigation options differ widely
in basic assumptions regarding carbon accounting, costs, land
areas, baselines, and other major parameters. The type of
mitigation options considered and the time frame of the study
affect the total mitigation potential estimated for the tropics.
A thorough comparative analysis is, therefore, very difficult.
More detailed estimates of economic or market potential for
mitigation options by region or country are needed to enable
policy makers to make realistic estimates of mitigation potential
under various policy, carbon price, and mitigation program
eligibility rule scenarios. Examples to build on include Benitez-
Ponce et al. (2007) and Waterloo et al. (2003), highlighting
the large potential by avoiding deforestation and enhancing

"Forest management activities to increase stand-level forest
carbon stocks include harvest systems that maintain partial
forest cover, minimize losses of dead organic matter (including
slash) or soil carbon by reducing soil erosion, and by avoiding
slash burning and other high-emission activities. Planting
after harvest or natural disturbances accelerates tree growth
and reduces carbon losses relative to natural regeneration.
Economic considerations are typically the main constraint,
because retaining additional carbon on site delays revenues
from harvest. The potential benefits of carbon sequestration can
be diminished where increased use of fertilizer causes greater
NO emissions. Drainage of forest soils, and specifically of
peatlands, may lead to substantial carbon loss due to enhanced
respiration (Ikkonen ef al., 2001). Moderate drainage, however,
can lead to increased peat carbon accumulation (Minkkinen et

2005 (MfE, 2005). Trotter et al. (2005) estimate New Zealand
has approximately 1.45 million ha of marginal pastoral land

A recent analysis estimated the net sink in Russia at 146-439

this baseline to be about 257 MtCO, per year in 2010, declining

Sohngen and Mendelsohn, 2003), or implementing mitigation
response curves generated by the sectoral model (Jakeman and

exogenous carbon price paths to simulate effects of different

mitigation potential have been produced. These include Benitez-

are provided that are consistent in methodology across countries
and regions, and in terms of measures included. Furthermore,
they provide a picture in which the forestry sector is one option
that is part of a multi sectoral climate policy and its measures.
Thus, these assessments provide insight into whether land-
based mitigation is a cost-efficient measure in comparison to
other mitigation efforts. Some of these models use a grid-based
global land-use model and provide insight into where these

"The anticipated carbon price path over time has important
implications for forest abatement potential and timing.
Rising carbon prices provide an incentive for delaying forest
abatement actions to later decades, when it is more profitable
(Sohngen and Sedjo, 2006). Carbon price expectations influence
forest investment decisions and are, therefore, an important
consideration for estimating mitigation potential. Contrary, high
constant carbon prices generate significant early mitigation, but
the quantity may vary over time. Mitigation strategies need to
take into account this temporal dimension if they seek to meet
specific mitigation goals at given dates in the future (US EPA,
2005).

"Some patterns emerge from the range of estimates reviewed
in order to assess the ratio between economic potential and
technical potential (Sathaye et al., 2007; Lewandrowski et al.,

potential estimates are generally significantly larger than the
economic potential. These studies are difficult to compare,
since each estimate uses different assumptions by different
analysts. Economic models used for these analyses can generate
mitigation potential estimates in competition to other forestry
or agricultural sector mitigation options. Generally, they do
not specify or account for specific policies and measures and
market penetration rates, so few market potential estimates are
generated. Many studies do not clearly state which potentials
are estimated.

"The range of economic potential as a percentage of technical
potential is 2% to 100% (the latter against all costs). At carbon
prices less than 7 US$/tCO), the highest estimate of economic

from 27 US$/tCO, to 50 US$/tCO,, the range of economic

IIASA-DIMA (Benitez-Ponce et al., 2007). For each model, output for different price scenarios has been published. The original authors were asked to provide data or
carbon supply under various carbon prices. These were summed and resulted in the total carbon supply as given middle column above. Because carbon supply unde
various price scenarios was requested, fractionation was possible as well.
Two right columns represent the proportion available in the given cost class. None of the models reported mitigation available at negative costs. The column for the
carbon supply fraction at costs between 50 and 100 US$/tCO, can easily be derived as 1- sum of the two right hand columns.

assessment models. These approaches include iterating with
the land-sector models (e.g., Sohngen and Mendelsohn, 2003),
and implementing mitigation response curves generated by
a sectoral model (Jakeman and Fisher, 2006). At present, all
integrated assessment models include afforestation strategies,
but only some consider avoided deforestation, and none
explicitly model forest management mitigation options (e.g.,

bio-energy crops. On-going top-down land-use modelling
developments should produce more refined characterization of
forestry abatement alternatives and cost-effective mitigation
potential in the near future. The results in Table 9.4 suggest
a reasonable central estimate of about 700 million tonne CO,

"Evaluating the cost-competitiveness of forestry mitigation
versus other sector options in achieving climate mitigation goals
requires different modelling capabilities. Global integrated
assessment and climate economic models are top-down models,
generally capable of dynamically representing feedbacks in the
economy across sectors and regions and reallocations of inputs,
as well as interactions between economic and atmospheric-
ocean-terrestrial systems. These models can be used to evaluate
long-term climate stabilization scenarios, like achieving a
stabilization target of 450 or 650 CO,-eq by 2100 (see Section
3.3.5). In this framework, the competitive mitigation role of
forest abatement options, such as afforestation, can be estimated
as part of a dynamic portfolio of the least-cost combination
of mitigation options from across all sectors of the economy,
including energy, transportation, and agriculture.

"Current use of biomass from fuelwood and forest residues reaches 33 EJ (see Section 4.3.3). Three main categories of for-
est residues may be used for energy purposes: primary residues (available from additional stemwood fellings or as residues
(branches) from thinning salvage after natural disturbances or final fellings); secondary residues (available from processing
forest products) and tertiary residues (available after end use). Various studies have assessed the future potential supply
of forest biomass (Yamamoto et al., 2001; Smeets and Faaij, 2007; Fischer and Schrattenholzer, 2001). Furthermore, some
global biomass potential studies include forest residues aggregated with crop residue and waste (Sorensen, 1999). At a
regional or national scale, studies are more detailed and often include economic considerations (Koopman, 2005; Bhattacha-
rya et al., 2005; Lindner et al., 2005; Cuiping et al., 2004). Typical values of residue recoverability are between 25 and 50 %
of the logging residues and between 33 and 80% of processing residues. Lower values are often assumed for developing
regions (Yamamoto et al., 2001; Smeets and Faaij, 2007). At a global level, scenario studies on the future energy mixture
(IPCC, 2000c; Sorensen, 1999; OECD, 2006) have included residues from the forestry sector in their energy supply (market
potential).

known. This depends on the balance of supply and demand (see bio-energy in Section 11.3.1.4.). However, to give an indica-
tion of the order of magnitude of the figures the CO,-eq emissions avoided have been calculated from the numbers in Table
9.5 using the assumption that biomass replaces either coal (high range) or gas (low range). Based on these calculations8, the
CO,-eq emissions avoided range from 420 to 4,400 MtCO,/yr for 2030. This is about 5 to 25% of the total CO,-eq emissions

includes fewer, simplified forest options, but allows competition
across all sectors of the economy to generate a portfolio of

present. This stems from differences in how the two approaches
represent mitigation options and costs, market dynamics, and
the effects of market prices on model and sectoral inputs and
outputs such as labour, capital, and land. One important reason
that bottom-up results yield a lower potential consistently
for every region (Figure 9.13) is that this type of study takes
into account (to some degree) barriers to implementation. The

"Some of the mitigation potential as given in this chapter might
be counteracted by adverse effects of climate change on forest
ecosystems (Fischlin et al., 2007). Further, mitigation-driven
actions in forestry could have positive adaptive consequences
(e.g., erosion protection) or negative adaptation consequences
(e.g., increase in pest and fires). Similarly, adaptation actions
could have positive or negative consequences on mitigation. To
avoid trade-offs, it is important to explore options to adapt to
new climate circumstances at an early stage through anticipatory
adaptation (Robledo et al., 2005). The limits to adaptation
stem in part from the way that societies exacerbate rather than
ameliorate vulnerability to climate fluctuations (Orlove, 2005)
that can also affect mitigation potentials. There are significant
opportunities for mitigation and for adapting to climate change,
while enhancing the conservation of biodiversity, and achieving

"The mitigation and adaptation trade-offs and synergies in
the forestry sector are dealt with in Klein et al. (2007). Many
of the response strategies to address climate change, such as
Global Environmental Facility (GEF) and Clean Development
Mechanism (CDM), Activities under Article 3.3 and Article
3.4 and the Adaptation Fund aim at implementation of either
mitigation or adaptation technologies or policies. It is necessary
to promote synergy in planning and implementation of forestry
mitigation and adaptation projects to derive maximum benefit
to the global environment as well as local communities or
economies, for example promoting adaptive forest management
(McGinley & Finegan, 2003). However, recent analyses not
specifically focused on the Forestry sector point out that it may
be difficult to enhance synergies. This is due to the different
actors involved in mitigation and adaptation, competitive use of
funds, and the fact that in many cases both activities take place
at different implementation levels (Tol, 2006). It should also
be taken into account that activities to address mitigation and
adaptation in the forestry sector are planned and implemented
locally.

"Itis likely that adaptation practices will be easier to implement
in forest plantations than in natural forests. Several adaptation
strategies or practices can be used in the forest sector, including
changes in land use choice (Kabat et a/., 2005), management
intensity, hardwood/softwood species mix, timber growth
and harvesting patterns within and between regions, changes
in rotation periods, salvaging dead timber, shifting to species
more productive under the new climatic conditions, landscape
planning to minimize fire and insect damage, and to provide
connectivity, and adjusting to altered wood size and quality
(Spittlehouse and Stewart, 2003). A primary aim of adaptive
management is to reduce as many ancillary stresses on the forest
resource as possible. Maintaining widely dispersed and viable
populations of individual species minimizes the probability that
localized catastrophic events will cause extinction (Fischlin et
al., 2007). While regrowth of trees due to effective protection
will lead to carbon sequestration, adaptive management of
protected areas also leads to conservation of biodiversity and
reduced vulnerability to climate change. For example, ecological
corridors create opportunities for migration of flora and fauna,
which facilitates adaptation to changing climate.

options in specific regions (e.g., Europe). Currently, afforestation
and reforestation are included under Article 3.3 and in Articles
6 and 12 (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol. Plantations consisting
of multiple species may be an attractive adaptation option as
they are more resilient, or less vulnerable, to climate change.
The latter as a result of different tolerance to climate change

abilities, and differential effectiveness of invading species

mitigation and adaptation will also advance sustainable
development, since mitigation activities could contribute to
reducing the vulnerability of natural ecosystems and socio-

"Deforestation in developing countries, the largest source of
emissions from the forestry sector, has remained at high levels
since 1990 (FAO, 2005). The causes of tropical deforestation
are complex, varying across countries and over time in response
to different social, cultural, and macroeconomic conditions
(Geist and Lambin, 2002). Broadly, three major barriers
to enacting effective policies to reduce forest loss are: (i)
profitability incentives often run counter to forest conservation
and sustainable forest management (Tacconi et al., 2003); (ii)
many direct and indirect drivers of deforestation lie outside of
the forest sector, especially in agricultural policies and markets
(Wunder, 2004); and (iii) limited regulatory and institutional
capacity and insufficient resources constrain the ability of many
governments to implement forest and related sectoral policies
on the ground (Tacconi et al., 2003).
"	Text
"This section examines the barriers, opportunities, and
implementation issues associated with policies affecting
mitigation in the forestry sector. Non-climate policies, that is
forest sector policies that affect net greenhouse gas emissions
from forests, but that are not designed primarily to achieve
climate objectives, as well as policies primarily designed
to reduce net forest emissions are considered. Many factors
influence the efficacy of forest policies in achieving intended
impacts on forest land-use, including land tenure, institutional
and regulatory capacity of governments, the financial
competitiveness of forestry as a land use, and a society’s
cultural relationship to forests. Some of these factors typically
differ between industrialized and developing countries. For
example, in comparison to developing countries, industrialized
countries tend to have relatively small amounts of unallocated
public lands, and relatively strong institutional and regulatory
capacities. Where appropriate, policy options and _ their
effectiveness are examined separately for industrialized and
developing countries. Because integrated and non-climate
policies are designed primarily to achieve objectives other than
net emissions reductions, evaluations of their effectiveness
focus primarily on indicators, such as maintenance of forest
cover. This provides only partial insight into their potential to
mitigate climate change. Under conditions with high potential
for leakage, for example, such indicators may overestimate the
potential for carbon benefits (Section 9.6.3).

health consequences of forest loss and degradation. In India,

partnering with communities to reduce forest degradation (Bhat

government institutions and public support are key factors in
implementing effective forest policies.

"Options for maintaining forests on private lands in
developing countries are generally more limited than on public
lands, as governments typically have less regulatory control.
An important exception is private landholdings in the Brazilian
Amazon, where the government requires that landowners
maintain 80% of the property under forest cover. Although this
regulation has had limited effectiveness in the past (Alves et
al., 1999), recent experience with a licensing and monitoring
system in the state of Mato Grosso has shown that commitment
to enforcement can significantly reduce deforestation rates.

"Arecently developed approach is for governments to provide
environmental service payments to private forest owners in
developing countries, thereby providing a direct financial
incentive for the retention of forest cover. Relatively high
transaction costs and insecure land and resource tenure have
thus far limited applications of this approach in many countries
(Grieg-Gran, 2004). However, significant potential may exist
for developing payment schemes for restoration and retention
of forest cover to provide climate mitigation (see below) and
watershed protection services.

Legally protecting forests by designating protected areas,
indigenous reserves, non-timber forest reserves and com-

forest cover in some countries, while in others, a lack of
resources and personnel result in the conversion of legally

For example, Santilli et al. (2005), propose that non-Annex
I countries might, on a voluntary basis, elect to reduce their
national emissions from deforestation. The emission reductions
could then be credited and sold to governments or international
carbon investors at the end of a commitment period, contingent
upon agreement to stabilize, or further reduce deforestation
rates in the subsequent commitment periods.

"Taken together, non-climate policies have had minimal
impact on slowing tropical deforestation, the single largest
contribution of land-use change to global carbon emissions.
Nevertheless, there are promising examples where countries
with adequate resources and political will have been able
to slow deforestation. This raises the possibility that, with
sufficient institutional capacity, financial incentives, political
will and sustained financial resources, it may possible to scale
up these efforts. One potential source of additional financing for
reducing deforestation in developing countries is through well-
constructed carbon markets or other environmental service
payment schemes (Winrock International, 2004; Stern, 2006).

associated with additionality and baseline setting and whether
leakage could be sufficiently controlled or quantified to allow
for robust carbon crediting (Trines et a/., 2006). In December

velopment of methods and tools for estimating and monitoring carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation
in developing countries. Remote sensing approaches to monitoring changes in land cover/land use at multiple scales and

identified as deforested or degraded through remote sensing. With sound data on both change in forest cover and on change

in carbon stocks resulting from deforestation and degradation, emissions can be estimated using methods described by the
new IPCC Inventory Guidelines (IPCC, 2006).

Incentives for plantation establishment may take the form of
afforestation grants, investment in transportation and roads,
energy subsidies, tax exemptions for forestry investments,
and tariffs against competing imports (Cossalter and Pye-
Smith, 2003). In contrast to conservation of existing forests,
the underlying financial incentives to establish plantations may
be positive. However, the creation of virtually all significant
plantation estates has relied upon government support, at least
in the initial stages. This is due, in part, to the illiquidity of
the investment, the high cost of capital establishment and long

forestry standards. Thus far, efforts to improve logging practices
in developing countries have met with limited success. For
example, reduced-impact logging (RIL) techniques would
increase carbon storage over traditional logging, but have not
been widely adopted by logging companies, even when they
lead to cost savings (Holmes et al., 2002). Nevertheless, there

of private ownership. Land control system and land allocation policy adopted by central governments often have negative
impacts on land and tree tenure. Local communities are not encouraged to plant, conserve and manage trees on government

because Parties to the UNFCCC agreed, “...that reversal of any
removal due to land use, land-use change and forestry activities
be accounted for at the appropriate point in time” (UNFCCC,
2001). In 2000, the Colombian delegation first presented a
proposal to create expiring Certified Emission Reductions
under CDM (UNFCCC, 2001). Its basic idea is that the validity
of Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) from afforestation
and reforestation project activities under CDM is linked to
the time of existence of the relating stocks. The principle of
temporary crediting gained support over the subsequent years.

"Experience is limited by the fact that Joint Implementation
is not operational yet, and the first call for afforestation and
reforestation (A/R) methodologies under CDM was only
issued in September 2004. In addition, the modalities and
procedures for CDM A/R as decided in December 2003 are
complex. Nevertheless, the capacities built up through the
development of projects and related methodologies should not
be underestimated. As of November 2006, 27 methodologies
were submitted, 17 from Latin America, four from Asia and
Africa respectively, and two from Eastern Europe. The four
which were approved by the CDM Executive Board relate to
projects located in China, Moldova, Albania and Honduras and
all consist of planting forests on degraded agricultural land. In
anticipation of Joint Implementation, several projects are under
development in several Annex I countries in Eastern Europe,
notably in Romania, Ukraine and the Czech Republic.

"The order of magnitude and even the direction of leakage
(negative versus positive), however, depend on the project
design (Schwarze et al., 2003). Leakage risk is likely to be
low if a whole country or sector is involved in the mitigation
activity, or if project activities are for subsistence and do not
affect timber or other product markets. There are also well-
documented methods to minimize leakage of project-based
activities. For example, afforestation projects can be combined
with biomass energy plants, or they may promote the use
of timber as construction material. Fostering agricultural
intensification in parallel can minimize negative leakage
from increased local land demand. Where a project reduces
deforestation, it can also reduce pressure on forest lands, for
example, by intensifying the availability of fuel wood from
other sources for local communities. Projects can be designed
to engage local people formerly responsible for deforestation in
alternative income-generating activities (Sohngen and Brown,
2004).

CERs critically depends on the market participants’ mitigation
cost expectations for future commitment periods. Assuming

"Sustainable forest management of both natural and planted
forests is essential to achieving sustainable development. It is
a means to reduce poverty, reduce deforestation, halt the loss of
forest biodiversity, and reduce land and resource degradation,
and contribute to climate change mitigation. Forests play an
important role in stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations
in the atmosphere while promoting sustainable development
(Article 2; Kyoto Protocol). Thus, forests have to be seen in
the framework of the multiple dimensions of sustainable
development, ifthe positive co-benefits from forestry mitigation
activities have to be maximized. Important environmental,

"For project monitoring, there is now an extended guidance
available (IPCC, 2006; USDOE, 2005). Monitoring costs
depend on many variables, including the project complexity
(including the number of stakeholders involved), heterogeneity
of the forest type, the number and type of carbon pools, and GHG
to be monitored and the appropriate measurement frequencies.
There is a trade-off between the completeness of monitoring
data and the carbon price that can be achieved: monitoring costs
can sum up an important share of a project’s transaction costs.
Proper design of the monitoring plan is, therefore, essential for
the economic viability of forestry projects. If project developers
can demonstrate that omitting particular carbon pools from
the project’s quantification exercise does not constitute an
overestimate of the project’s GHG benefits, such pools may be
left outside the monitoring plan.
"	Text
"Despite relative low costs and many possible positive side-
effects, the pace with which forest carbon projects are being
implemented is slow. This is due to a variety of barriers.
Barriers can be categorized as economic, risk-related, political/
bureaucratic, logistic, and capacity or political will (the latter
barrier also occurring in industrialized countries; Trines et al.,
2006). One of the most important climate-related barriers is the
complexity of the rules for afforestation and reforestation project
activities. This leads to uncertainty among project developers
and investors. Temporary accounting of credits is a major
obstacle for two reasons: (1) The future value of temporary
CERs depends on the buyer’s confidence in the underlying
project. This may limit investor interest in getting involved in
project development. (2) The value of temporary CERs hinges
on future allowance price expectations because they will have
to be replaced in future commitment periods. Furthermore,
EU has deferred its decision to accept forestry credits under
its emissions trading scheme. Even if EU decided to integrate
these credits, this would come too late to take effect in the first
commitment period because trees need time to grow. Given the
low value of temporary CERs, transaction costs have a higher
share in afforestation and reforestation than in energy mitigation
projects. Simplified small-scale rules were introduced in order to
reduce transaction costs, but the maximum size of 8 kilotonnes
of average annual CO, net removal limits their viability.

Regarding chemical properties, increased Na concentrations,
exchangeable sodium percentage and soil acidity, and decreased

"In the long-term, carbon will only be one of the goals that
drive land-use decisions. Within each region, local solutions
have to be found that optimize all goals and aim at integrated
and sustainable land use. Developing the optimum regional
strategies for climate change mitigation involving forests
will require complex analyses of the trade-offs (synergies and
competition) in land-use between forestry and other land uses,
"	Text
"climatic change and its many dynamic feedbacks can cause
large variation in future carbon balance projections (Lewis
et al., 2005). Other scenarios suggest that net deforestation
pressure will slow over time as population growth slows and
crop and livestock productivity increase. Despite continued
projected loss of forest area, carbon uptake from afforestation
and reforestation could result in net sequestration (Section
3.2.2).
"	Text
"Also, the impacts of climate change on forests will be a
major source of uncertainty regarding future projections (Viner
et al., 2006). Other issues that will have an effect on the long-
term mitigation potential include future sectoral changes within
forestry, changes in other economic sectors, as well as political
and social change, and the particular development paths
within industrialized and developing countries beyond the first
half of the 21st century. The actual mitigation potential will
depend ultimately on solving structural problems linked to the
sustainable management of forests. Such structural problems
include securing land tenure and land rights of indigenous
people, reducing poverty levels in rural areas and the rural-urban
divide, and providing disincentives to short-term behaviour of
economic actors and others. Considering that forests store more
carbon dioxide than the entire atmosphere (Stern, 2006), the
role of forests is critical.
"	Text
"Forestry mitigation projections are expected to be regionally
unique, while still linked across time and space by changes in
global physical and economic forces. Overall, it is expected that
boreal primary forests will either be sources or sinks depending
on the net effect of some enhancement of growth due to climate
change versus a loss of soil organic matter and emissions from
increased fires. The temperate forests in USA, Europe, China
and Oceania, will probably continue to be net carbon sinks,
favoured also by enhanced forest growth due to climate change.
In the tropical regions, the human induced land-use changes
are expected to continue to drive the dynamics for decades. In
the meantime, the enhanced growth of large areas of primary
forests, secondary regrowth, and increasing plantation areas
will also increase the sink. Beyond 2040, depending on the
extent and effectiveness of forest mitigation activities within
tropical areas, and very particularly on the effectiveness of
policies aimed at reducing forest degradation and deforestation,
tropical forest may become net sinks. In the medium to long
term as well, commercial bio-energy is expected to become
increasingly important.

"Commercial recovery of landfill CH, as a source of
renewable energy has been practised at full scale since 1975
"	Text
"and currently exceeds 105 MtCO,-eq, yr. Because of landfill gas
recovery and complementary measures (increased recycling,
decreased landfilling, use of alternative waste-management
technologies), landfill CH, emissions from developed countries
have been largely stabilized (high evidence, high agreement).
However, landfill CH, emissions from developing countries are
increasing as more controlled (anaerobic) landfilling practices
are implemented; these emissions could be reduced by both
accelerating the introduction of engineered gas recovery and
encouraging alternative waste management strategies (medium
evidence, medium agreement).
"	Text
"Incineration and industrial co-combustion for waste-to-
energy provide significant renewable energy benefits and fossil
fuel offsets. Currently, >130 million tonnes of waste per year are
incinerated at over 600 plants (high evidence, high agreement).
Thermal processes with advanced emission controls are proven
technology but more costly than controlled landfilling with
landfill gas recovery; however, thermal processes may become
more viable as energy prices increase. Because landfills produce
CH, for decades, incineration, composting and other strategies
that reduce landfilled waste are complementary mitigation
measures to landfill gas recovery in the short- to medium-term
(medium evidence, medium agreement).

"Increased infrastructure for wastewater management in
developing countries can provide multiple benefits for GHG
mitigation, improved public health, conservation of water
resources, and reduction of untreated discharges to surface
water, groundwater, soils and coastal zones. There are numerous
mature technologies that can be implemented to improve
wastewater collection, transport, re-use, recycling, treatment
and residuals management (high evidence, high agreement).
With respect to both waste and wastewater management
for developing countries, key constraints on sustainable
development include the local availability of capital as well as
the selection of appropriate and truly sustainable technology in
a particular setting (high evidence, high agreement).
"	Text
"Aided by Kyoto mechanisms such as the Clean Development
Mechanism (CDM) and Joint Implementation (JI), as well as
other measures to increase worldwide rates of landfill CH,
recovery, the total global economic mitigation potential for
reducing landfill CH, emissions in 2030 is estimated to be
>1000 MtCO,-eq (or 70% of estimated emissions) at costs
below 100 US$/tCO,-eq/yr. Most of this potential is achievable
at negative to low costs: 20-30% of projected emissions for
2030 can be reduced at negative cost and 30-50% at costs
<20 US$/tCO,-eq/yr. At higher costs, more significant emission
reductions are achievable, with most of the additional mitigation
potential coming from thermal processes for waste-to-energy
(medium evidence, medium agreement).
"	Text
"Because waste management decisions are often made
locally without concurrent quantification of GHG mitigation,
the importance of the waste sector for reducing global GHG
emissions has been underestimated (medium evidence, high
agreement). Flexible strategies and financial incentives can
expand waste management options to achieve GHG mitigation
goals — in the context of integrated waste management, local
technology decisions are a function of many competing
variables, including waste quantity and characteristics, cost
and financing issues, infrastructure requirements including
available land area, collection and transport considerations, and
regulatory constraints. Life cycle assessment (LCA) can provide
decision-support tools (high evidence, high agreement).
"	Text
"Existing waste-management practices can provide effective
mitigation of GHG emissions from this sector: a wide range
of mature, environmentally-effective technologies are available
to mitigate emissions and provide public health, environmental
protection, and sustainable development co-benefits.
Collectively, these technologies can directly reduce GHG
emissions (through landfill gas recovery, improved landfill
practices, engineered wastewater management) or avoid
significant GHG generation (through controlled composting
of organic waste, state-of-the-art incineration and expanded
sanitation coverage) (high evidence, high agreement). In
addition, waste minimization, recycling and re-use represent
an important and increasing potential for indirect reduction
of GHG emissions through the conservation of raw materials,
improved energy and resource efficiency and fossil fuel
avoidance (medium evidence, high agreement).
"	Text
"Post-consumer waste is a small contributor to global
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (<5%) with total emissions
of approximately 1300 MtCO,-eq in 2005. The largest source
is landfill methane (CH,), followed by wastewater CH, and
nitrous oxide (NO); in addition, minor emissions of carbon
dioxide (CO) result from incineration of waste containing
fossil carbon (C) (plastics; synthetic textiles) (high evidence,
high agreement). There are large uncertainties with respect to
direct emissions, indirect emissions and mitigation potentials
for the waste sector. These uncertainties could be reduced
by consistent national definitions, coordinated local and
international data collection, standardized data analysis and
field validation of models (medium evidence, high agreement).
With respect to annual emissions of fluorinated gases from
post-consumer waste, there are no existing national inventory
methods for the waste sector, so these emissions are not currently
quantified. If quantified in the future, recent data indicating
anaerobic biodegradation of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) in landfill settings should
be considered (low evidence, high agreement).

"It should be noted that a separate chapter on post-consumer
waste is new for the Fourth Assessment report; in the Third
Assessment Report (TAR), GHG mitigation strategies for waste

"Post-consumer waste is a significant renewable energy
resource whose energy value can be exploited through thermal
processes (incineration and industrial co-combustion), landfill
gas utilization and the use of anaerobic digester biogas. Waste

"	Text
"2000; IPCC, 2001a). It must also be stressed that there are high
uncertainties regarding global GHG emissions from waste which
result from national and regional differences in definitions, data
collection and statistical analysis. Because of space constraints,
this chapter does not include detailed discussion of waste
management technologies, nor does this chapter prescribe to
any one particular technology. Rather, this chapter focuses on
the GHG mitigation aspects of the following strategies: landfill
CH, recovery and utilization; optimizing methanotrophic
CH, oxidation in landfill cover soils; alternative strategies to
landfilling for GHG avoidance (composting; incineration and
other thermal processes; mechanical and biological treatment
(MBT)); waste reduction through recycling, and expanded
wastewater management to minimize GHG generation and
emissions. In addition, using available but very limited data,
this chapter will discuss emissions of non-methane volatile
organic compounds (NMVOCs) from waste and end-of-life
issues associated with fluorinated gases.
"	Text
"The major GHG emissions from the waste sector are landfill
CH, and, secondarily, wastewater CH, and N,O. In addition,
the incineration of fossil carbon results in minor emissions of
CO,. Chapter 10 focuses on mitigation of GHG emissions from
post-consumer waste, as well as emissions from municipal
wastewater and high biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)
industrial wastewaters conveyed to public treatment facilities.
Other chapters in this volume address pre-consumer GHG
emissions from waste within the industrial (Chapter 7) and
energy (Chapter 4) sectors which are managed within those
respective sectors. Other chapters address agricultural wastes
and manures (Chapter 8), forestry residues (Chapter 9) and
related energy supply issues including district heating (Chapter
6) and transportation biofuels (Chapter 5). National data are
not available to quantify GHG emissions associated with waste
transport, including reductions that might be achieved through
lower collection frequencies, higher routing efficiencies or
substitution of renewable fuels; however, all of these measures
can be locally beneficial to reduce emissions.

"Waste generation is closely linked to population, urbanization
and affluence. The archaeologist E.W. Haury wrote: ‘Whichever
way one views the mounds [of waste], as garbage piles to
avoid, or as symbols of a way of life, they...are the features
more productive of information than any others.’ (1976, p.80).
Archaeological excavations have yielded thicker cultural
layers from periods of prosperity; correspondingly, modern
waste-generation rates can be correlated to various indicators
of affluence, including gross domestic product (GDP)/cap,
energy consumption/cap, , and private final consumption/cap
(Bingemer and Crutzen, 1987; Richards, 1989; Rathje et al.,
1992; Mertins et al., 1999; US EPA, 1999; Nakicenovic ef al.,
2000; Bogner and Matthews, 2003; OECD, 2004). In developed
countries seeking to reduce waste generation, a current goal is
to decouple waste generation from economic driving forces
such as GDP (OECD, 2003; Giegrich and Vogt, 2005; EEA,
2005). In most developed and developing countries with
increasing population, prosperity and urbanization, it remains a
major challenge for municipalities to collect, recycle, treat and
dispose of increasing quantities of solid waste and wastewater.
A cornerstone of sustainable development is the establishment
of affordable, effective and truly sustainable waste management
practices in developing countries. It must be further emphasized
that multiple public health, safety and environmental co-
benefits accrue from effective waste management practices
which concurrently reduce GHG emissions and improve
the quality of life, promote public health, prevent water and
soil contamination, conserve natural resources and provide
renewable energy benefits.
"	Text
"The mitigation of GHG emissions from waste must be
addressed in the context of integrated waste management.
Most technologies for waste management are mature and have
been successfully implemented for decades in many countries.
Nevertheless, there is significant potential for accelerating both
the direct reduction of GHG emissions from waste as well as
extended implications for indirect reductions within other
sectors. LCA is an essential tool for consideration of both the
direct and indirect impacts of waste management technologies
and policies (Thorneloe et al., 2002; 2005; WRAP, 2006).
Because direct emissions represent only a portion of the
life cycle impacts of various waste management strategies
(Ackerman, 2000), this chapter includes complementary
strategies for GHG avoidance, indirect GHG mitigation and
use of waste as a source of renewable energy to provide fossil
fuel offsets. Using LCA and other decision-support tools,
there are many combined mitigation strategies that can be
cost-effectively implemented by the public or private sector.
Landfill CH, recovery and optimized wastewater treatment can
directly reduce GHG emissions. GHG generation can be largely
avoided through controlled aerobic composting and thermal
processes such as incineration for waste-to-energy. Moreover,
waste prevention, minimization, material recovery, recycling
and re-use represent a growing potential for indirect reduction
of GHG emissions through decreased waste generation, lower
raw material consumption, reduced energy demand and fossil
fuel avoidance. Recent studies (e.g., Smith et al., 2001; WRAP,
2006) have begun to comprehensively quantify the significant
benefits of recycling for indirect reductions of GHG emissions
from the waste sector.

"A process-oriented perspective on the major GHG emissions
from the waste sector is provided in Figure 10.2. In the context
of a landfill CH, mass balance (Figure 10.2a), emissions are
one of several possible pathways for the CH, produced by
anaerobic methanogenic microorganisms in landfills; other
pathways include recovery, oxidation by aerobic methanotrophic
microorganisms in cover soils, and two longer-term pathways:
lateral migration and internal storage (Bogner and Spokas, 1993;
Spokas et al., 2006). With regard to emissions from wastewater
transport and treatment (Figure 10.2b), the CH, is microbially
produced under strict anaerobic conditions as in landfills, while
the N,O is an intermediate product of microbial nitrogen cycling
promoted by conditions of reduced aeration, high moisture and
abundant nitrogen. Both GHGs can be produced and emitted at
many stages between wastewater sources and final disposal.
"	Text
"It is important to stress that both the CH, and N,O from the
waste sector are microbially produced and consumed with rates
controlled by temperature, moisture, pH, available substrates,
microbial competition and many other factors. As a result,
CH, and N,O generation, microbial consumption, and net
emission rates routinely exhibit temporal and spatial variability
over many orders of magnitude, exacerbating the problem of
developing credible national estimates. The N,O from landfills
is considered an insignificant source globally (Bogner et al.,
1999; Rinne et al., 2005), but may need to be considered locally
where cover soils are amended with sewage sludge (Borjesson
and Svensson, 1997a) or aerobic/semi-aerobic landfilling
practices are implemented (Tsujimoto ef al., 1994). Substantial
emissions of CH, and N,O can occur during wastewater
transport in closed sewers and in conjunction with anaerobic
or aerobic treatment. In many developing countries, in addition
to GHG emissions, open sewers and uncontrolled solid waste
disposal sites result in serious public health problems resulting
from pathogenic microorganisms, toxic odours and disease
vectors.

"(See also Section 11.3.1.4). The energy content of waste can
be more efficiently exploited using thermal processes than with
the production of biogas: during combustion, energy is directly
derived both from biomass (paper products, wood, natural
textiles, food) and fossil carbon sources (plastics, synthetic
textiles). The heating value of mixed municipal waste ranges
from <6 to >14 MJ/kg (Khan and Abu-Ghararath, 1991; EIPPC
Bureau, 2006). Thermal processes are most effective at the upper
end of this range where high values approach low-grade coals
(lignite). Using a conservative value of 900 Mt/yr for total waste
generation in 2002 (discussed in Box 10.1 below), the energy
potential of waste is approximately 5—13 EJ/yr. Assuming an
average heating value of 9 GJ/t for mixed waste (Dornburg and
Faaij, 2006) and converting to energy equivalents, global waste
in 2002 contained about 8 EJ of available energy, which could
increase to 13 EJ in 2030 using waste projections in Monni et
al. (2006). Currently, more than 130 million tonnes per year
of waste are combusted worldwide (Themelis, 2003), which is
equivalent to >1 EJ/yr (assuming 9 GJ/t). The biogas fuels from
waste — landfill gas and digester gas — typically have a heating
value of 16-22 MJ/Nm3, depending directly on the CH, content.
Both are used extensively worldwide for process heating and
on-site electrical generation; more rarely, landfill gas may be
upgraded to a substitute natural gas product. Conservatively, the
energy value of landfill gas currently being utilized is >0.2 EJ/
yr (using data from Willumsen, 2003).

countries (Table 10.1). Even though labour costs are lower in
developing countries, waste management can constitute a larger
percentage of municipal income because of higher equipment
and fuel costs (Cointreau-Levine, 1994). By 1990, many
developed countries had initiated comprehensive recycling
programmes. It is important to recognize that the percentages
of waste recycled, composted, incinerated or landfilled differ
greatly amongst municipalities due to multiple factors, including
local economics, national policies, regulatory restrictions,

validated using reliable datasets, can provide a cross-check on
uncertain national data. Moreover, the use ofa surrogate provides
a reasonable methodology for a large number of countries where

"The availability and quality of annual data are major problems
for the waste sector. Solid waste and wastewater data are
lacking for many countries, data quality is variable, definitions
are not uniform, and interannual variability is often not well
quantified. There are three major approaches that have been
used to estimate global waste generation: 1) data from national
waste statistics or surveys, including IPCC methodologies
(IPCC, 2006); 2) estimates based on population (e.g., SRES
waste scenarios), and 3) the use of a proxy variable linked to
demographic or economic indicators for which national data are
annually collected. The SRES waste scenarios, using population
as the major driver, projected continuous increases in waste and
wastewater CH, emissions to 2030 (AIB-AIM), 2050 (B1-
AIM), or 2100 (A2-ASF; B2-MESSAGE), resulting in current
and future emissions significantly higher than those derived
from IPCC inventory procedures (Nakicenovic et al., 2000)
(See also Section 10.3). A major reason is that waste generation
rates are related to affluence as well as population — richer
societies are characterized by higher rates of waste generation
per capita, while less affluent societies generate less waste and
practise informal recycling/re-use initiatives that reduce the
waste per capita to be collected at the municipal level. The
third strategy is to use proxy or surrogate variables based on
statistically significant relationships between waste generation
"	Text
"Solid-waste generation rates are a function of both population and prosperity, but data are lacking or questionable for
many countries. This results in high uncertainties for GHG emissions estimates, especially from developing countries. One
strategy is to use a proxy variable for which national statistics are available on an annual basis for all countries. For example,
using national solid-waste data from 1975-1995 that were reliably referenced to a given base year, Bogner and Matthews
(2003) developed simple linear regression models for waste generation per capita for developed and developing countries.
These empirical models were based on energy consumption per capita as an indicator of affluence and a proxy for waste
generation per capita; the surrogate relationship was applied to annual national data using either total population (developed
countries) or urban population (developing countries). The methodology was validated using post-1995 data which had not
been used to develop the original model relationships. The results by region for 1971-2002 (Figure 10.3a) indicate that ap-
proximately 900 Mt of waste were generated in 2002. Unlike projections based on population alone, this figure also shows
regional waste-generation trends that decrease and increase in tandem with major economic trends. For comparison, recent
waste-generation estimates by Monni et al. (2006) using 2006 inventory guidelines, indicated about 1250 Mt of waste gener-
ated in 2000. Figure 10.3b showing annual carbon storage in landfills was developed using the same base data as Figure
10.3a with the percentage of landfilled waste for each country (reported to UNFCCC) and a conservative assumption of 50%
carbon storage (Bogner, 1992; Barlaz, 1998). This storage is long-term: under the anaerobic conditions in landfills, lignin does
not degrade significantly (Chen et al., 2004), while some cellulosic fractions are also non-degraded. The annual totals for the
mid-1980s and later (>30 MtC/yr) exceed estimates in the literature for the annual quantity of organic carbon partitioned to
long-term geologic storage in marine environments as a precursor to future fossil fuels (Bogner, 1992). It should be noted that
the anaerobic burial of waste in landfills (with resulting carbon storage) has been widely implemented in developed countries
only since the 1960s and 1970s.

almost 90% of the population in developed countries, but only
about 30% of the population in developing countries, has access

lack adequate sanitation. In both Southern and Eastern Asia,
rapid urbanization is posing a challenge for the development of
wastewater infrastructure. The highly urbanized region of Latin

providing wastewater treatment. In the Middle East and North

treatment require data on degradable organic matter (BOD;
COD!) and nitrogen. Nitrogen content can be estimated using
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) data on protein
consumption, and either the application of wastewater treatment,
or its absence, determines the emissions. Aerobic treatment
plants produce negligible or very small emissions, whereas
in anaerobic lagoons or latrines 50-80% of the CH, potential
can be produced and emitted. In addition, one must take into
account the established infrastructure for wastewater treatment
in developed countries and the lack of both infrastructure and
financial resources in developing countries where open sewers
or informally ponded wastewaters often result in uncontrolled
discharges to surface water, soils, and coastal zones, as well
as the generation of N,O and CHy. The majority of urban
wastewater treatment facilities are publicly operated and only
about 14% of the total private investment in water and sewerage

US data indicate about 25% diversion, including more than
20 states that prohibit landfilling of garden waste (Simmons

intensive informal recycling often occurs. Via various diversion
and small-scale recycling activities, those who make their
living from decentralized waste management can significantly
reduce the mass of waste that requires more centralized
solutions; however, the challenge for the future is to provide
safer, healthier working conditions than currently experienced
by scavengers on uncontrolled dumpsites. Available studies
indicate that recycling activities by this sector can generate
significant employment, especially for women, through creative
microfinance and other small-scale investments. For example,
in Cairo, available studies indicate that 7-8 daily jobs per ton of

"quantities of post-consumer waste are now being diverted to
incineration, as well as to MBT before landfilling to 1) recover
recyclables and 2) reduce the organic carbon content by a partial
aerobic composting or anaerobic digestion (Stegmann, 2005).
The MBT residuals are often, but not always, landfilled after
achieving organic carbon reductions to comply with the EU
landfill directive. Depending on the types and quality control of
various separation and treatment processes, a variety of useful
recycled streams are also produced. Incineration for waste-
to-energy has been widely implemented in many European
countries for decades. In 2002, EU WTE plants generated 41
million GJ of electrical energy and 110 million GJ of thermal
energy (Themelis, 2003). Rates of incineration are expected to
increase in parallel with implemention of the landfill directive,
especially in countries such as the UK with historically lower
rates of incineration compared to other European countries.
In North America, Australia and New Zealand, controlled
landfilling is continuing as a dominant method for large-scale
waste disposal with mandated compliance to both landfilling
and air-quality regulations. In parallel, larger quantities of
landfill CH, are annually being recovered, both to comply
with air-quality regulations and to provide energy, assisted by
national tax credits and local renewable-energy/green power
initiatives (see Section 10.5). The US, Canada, Australia and
other countries are currently studying and considering the
widespread implementation of ‘bioreactor’ landfills to compress
the time period during which high rates of CH, generation occur

tipping fees in many regions, negative public perceptions and
high capital costs. In Japan, where open space is very limited
for construction of waste management infrastructure, very high
rates of both recycling and incineration are practised and are
expected to continue into the future. Historically, there have
also been ‘semi-aerobic’ Japanese landfills with potential for
N,O generation (Tsujimoto et al., 1994). Similar aerobic (with
air) landfill practices have also been studied or implemented
in Europe and the US for reduced CH, generation rates as an
alternative to, or in combination with, anaerobic (without air)

"With regard to wastewater trends, a current priority in
developing countries is to increase the historically low rates of
wastewater collection and treatment. One of the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) is to reduce by 50% the number
of people without access to safe sanitation by 2015. One
strategy may be to encourage more on-site sanitation rather
than expensive transport of sewerage to centralized treatment
plants: this strategy has been successful in Dakar, Senegal, at
the cost of about 400 US$ per household. It has been estimated
that, for sanitation, the annual investment must increase from
4 billion US$ to 18 billion US$ to achieve the MDG target,
mostly in East Asia, South Asia and Sub-Saharan A frica (World

"For landfill CH,, the largest GHG emission from the waste
sector, emissions continue several decades after waste disposal;
thus, the estimation of emission trends requires models that
include temporal trends. Methane is also emitted during
wastewater transport, sewage treatment processes and leakages
from anaerobic digestion of waste or wastewater sludges.
The major sources of N,O are human sewage and wastewater
treatment. The CO, from the non-biomass portion of incinerated
waste is a small source of GHG emissions. The IPCC 2006
Guidelines also provide methodologies for CO,, CH, and N,O
emissions from open burning of waste and for CH, and N,O
emissions from composting and anaerobic digestion of biowaste.
Open burning of waste in developing countries is a significant
local source of air pollution, constituting a health risk for nearby
communities. Composting and other biological treatments emit
very small quantities of GHGs but were included in 2006 IPCC
Guidelines for completeness.

"In many developing countries, current trends suggest
that increases in controlled landfilling resulting in anaerobic
decomposition of organic waste will be implemented in parallel
with increased urbanization. For rapidly growing ‘mega
cities’, engineered landfills provide a waste disposal solution
that is more environmentally acceptable than open dumpsites
and uncontrolled burning of waste. There are also persuasive
public health reasons for implementing controlled landfilling
— urban residents produce more solid waste per capita than
rural inhabitants, and large amounts of uncontrolled refuse
accumulating in areas of high population density are linked
to vermin and disease (Christensen, 1989). The process of
converting open dumping and burning to engineered landfills
implies control of waste placement, compaction, the use of
cover materials, implementation of surface water diversion
and drainage, and management of leachate and gas, perhaps
applying an intermediate level of technology consistent
with limited financial resources (Savage et al., 1998). These
practices shift the production of CO, (by burning and aerobic
decomposition) to anaerobic production of CH,. This is largely
the same transition that occurred in many developed countries in
the 1950-1970 time frame. Paradoxically, this results in higher
rates of CH, generation and emissions than previous open-
dumping and burning practices. In addition, many developed
and developing countries have historically implemented large-
scale aerobic composting of waste. This has often been applied
to mixed waste, which, in practice, is similar to implementing
an initial aerobic MBT process. However, source-separated
biodegradable waste streams are preferable to mixed waste
in order to produce higher quality compost products for
horticultural and other uses (Diaz et al., 2002; Perla, 1997). In
developing countries, composting can provide an affordable,
sustainable alternative to controlled landfilling, especially
where more labour-intensive lower technology strategies
are applied to selected biodegradable wastes (Hoornweg
et al., 1999). It remains to be seen if mechanized recycling
and more costly alternatives such as incineration and MBT
will be widely implemented in developing countries. Where
decisions regarding waste management are made at the local
level by communities with limited financial resources seeking
the least-cost environmentally acceptable solution — often this
is landfilling or composting (Hoornweg, 1999; Hoornweg et

"emissions from the waste sector declined 14-19% for Annex
I and EIT countries (UNFCCC, 2005). The waste sector
contributed 2-3% of the global GHG total for Annex I and
EIT countries for 2003, but a higher percentage (4.3%) for
non-Annex I countries (various reporting years from 1990—
2000) (UNFCCC, 2005). In developed countries, landfill CH,
emissions are stabilizing due to increased landfill CH, recovery,
decreased landfilling, and decreased waste generation as a result
of local waste management decisions including recycling, local
economic conditions and policy initiatives. On the other hand,
rapid increases in population and urbanization in developing
countries are resulting in increases in GHG emissions from
waste, especially CH, from landfills and both CH, and N,O
from wastewater. CH, emissions from wastewater alone are
expected to increase almost 50% between 1990 and 2020,
especially in the rapidly developing countries of Eastern and
Southern Asia (US EPA, 2006; Table 10.3). Estimates of global
N,O emissions from wastewater are incomplete and based only
on human sewage treatment, but these indicate an increase of
25% between 1990 and 2020 (Zable 10.3). It is important to
emphasize, however, that these are business-as-usual (BAU)
scenarios, and actual emissions could be much lower if
additional measures are in place. Future reductions in emissions
from the waste sector will partially depend on the post-2012
availability of Kyoto mechanisms such the CDM and JI.

"Overall, the waste sector contributes <5% of global GHG
emissions. Table 10.3 compares estimated emissions and trends
from two studies: US EPA (2006) and Monni et al. (2006). The
US EPA (2006) study collected data from national inventories
and projections reported to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and supplemented
data gaps with estimates and extrapolations based on IPCC
default data and simple mass balance calculations using the
1996 IPCC Tier 1 methodology for landfill CH,. Monni et
al. (2006) calculated a time series for landfill CH, using the
first-order decay (FOD) methodology and default data in the
2006 IPCC Guidelines, taking into account the time lag in
landfill emissions compared to year of disposal. The estimates
by Monni e¢ al. (2006) are lower than US EPA (2006) for the
period 1990-2005 because the former reflect slower growth in
emissions relative to the growth in waste. However, the future
projected growth in emissions by Monni et al. (2006) is higher,
because recent European decreases in landfilling are reflected
more slowly in the future projections. For comparison, the
reported 1995 CH, emissions from landfills and wastewater
from national inventories were approximately 1000 MtCO,eq
(UNFCCC, 2005). In general, data from Non-Annex | countries
are limited and usually available only for 1994 (or 1990). In the
TAR, annual global CH, and N,O emissions from all sources
were approximately 600 Tg CH,/yr and 17.7 Tg N/yr as N,O
(IPCC, 2001b). The direct comparison of reported emissions in
Table 10.3 with the SRES Al and B2 scenarios (Nakicenovic
et al., 2000) for GHG emissions from waste is problematical:
the SRES do not include landfill-gas recovery (commercial
since 1975) and project continuous increases in CH, emissions
based only on population increases to 2030 (AIB-AIM) or 2100

"Landfill CH, has historically been the largest source of
GHG emissions from the waste sector. The growth in landfill
emissions has diminished during the last 20 years due to
increased rates of landfill CH, recovery in many countries
and decreased rates of landfilling in the EU. The recovery and
utilization of landfill CH, as a source of renewable energy was
first commercialized in 1975 and is now being implemented
at >1150 plants worldwide with emission reductions of >105
MtCO,-eq/yr (Willumsen, 2003; Bogner and Matthews, 2003).
This number should be considered a minimum because there
are also many sites that recover and flare landfill gas without
energy recovery. Figure 10.5 compares regional emissions
estimates for five-year intervals from 1990-2020 (US EPA,
2006) to annual historical estimates from 1971-2002 (Bogner
and Matthews, 2003). The trends converge for Europe and the
OECD Pacific, but there are differences for North America and
Asia related to differences in methodologies and assumptions.
"	Text
"A comparison of the present rate of landfill CH, recovery
to estimated global emissions (Table 10.3) indicates that the
minimum recovery and utilization rates discussed above (>105
MtCO,-eq yr) currently exceed the average projected increase
from 2005 to 2010. Thus, it is reasonable to state that landfill
CH, recovery is beginning to stabilize emissions from this
source. A linear regression using historical data from the early
1980s to 2003 indicates a conservative growth rate for landfill
CH, utilization of approximately 5% per year (Bogner and
Matthews, 2003). For the EU-15, trends indicate that landfill
CH, emissions are declining substantially. Between 1990 and
2002, landfill CH, emissions decreased by almost 30% (Deuber
et al., 2005) due to the early implementation of the landfill
directive (1999/3 1/EC) and similar national legislation intended
to both reduce the landfilling of biodegradable waste and
increase landfill CH, recovery at existing sites. By 2010, GHG
emissions from waste in the EU are projected to be more than
50% below 1990 levels due to these initiatives (EEA, 2004).

infrequently practised because of high capital and operating

The uncontrolled burning of waste for volume reduction in
these countries is still a common practice that contributes to
urban air pollution (Hoornweg, 1999). Incineration is also not
the technology of choice for wet waste, and municipal waste
in many developing countries contains a high percentage of
food waste with high moisture contents. In some developing
countries, however, the rate of waste incineration is increasing.
In China, for example, waste incineration has increased rapidly
from 1.7% of municipal waste in 2000 to 5% in 2005 (including

"A wide range of mature technologies is available to mitigate
GHG emissions from waste. These technologies include
landfilling with landfill gas recovery (reduces CH, emissions),
post-consumer recycling (avoids waste generation), composting
of selected waste fractions (avoids GHG generation), and
processes that reduce GHG generation compared to landfilling
(thermal processes including incineration and industrial co-
combustion, MBT with landfilling of residuals, and anaerobic
digestion). Therefore, the mitigation of GHG emissions from
waste relies on multiple technologies whose application
depends on local, regional and national drivers for both waste
management and GHG mitigation. There are many appropriate
low- to high-technology strategies discussed in this section
(see Figure 10.7 for a qualitative comparison of technologies).
At the ‘high technology’ end, there are also advanced thermal
processes for waste such as pyrolysis and gasification, which
are beginning to be applied in the EU, Japan and elsewhere.
Because of variable feedstocks and high unit costs, these
processes have not been routinely applied to mixed municipal
waste at large scale (thousands of tonnes per day). Costs and

"there are fugitive emissions from landfilled waste prior to and
after the implementation of active gas extraction; thus estimates
of ‘lifetime’ recovery efficiencies may be as low as 20% (Oonk
and Boom, 1995), which argues for early implementation
of gas recovery. Some measures that can be implemented to
improve overall gas collection are installation of horizontal gas
collection systems concurrent with filling, frequent monitoring
and remediation of edge and piping leakages, installation of
secondary perimeter extraction systems for gas migration and
emissions control, and frequent inspection and maintenance
of cover materials. Currently, landfill CH, is being used to
fuel industrial boilers; to generate electricity using internal
combustion engines, gas turbines or steam turbines; and to
produce a substitute natural gas after removal of CO, and trace
components. Although electrical output ranges from small
30 kWe microturbines to 50 MWe steam turbine generators,
most plants are in the 1-15 MWe range. Significant barriers to
increased diffusion of landfill gas utilization, especially where
it has not been previously implemented, can be local reluctance
from electrical utilities to include small power producers
and from gas utilities/pipeline companies to transport small
percentages of upgraded landfill gas in natural gas pipelines.

many developed countries, especially those with limited space

"Waste incinerators have been extensively used for more
than 20 years with increasingly stringent emission standards
in Japan, the EU, the US and other countries. Mass burning is
relatively expensive and, depending on plant scale and flue-gas

140 US$/t) (Faaij et al., 1998; EIPPC Bureau, 2006). Waste-
to-energy plants can also produce useful heat or electricity,
which improves process economics. Japanese incinerators have
routinely implemented energy recovery or power generation
(Japan Ministry of the Environment, 2006). In northern Europe,
urban incinerators have historically supplied fuel for district
heating of residential and commercial buildings. Starting in the
1980s, large waste incinerators with stringent emission standards
have been widely deployed in Germany, the Netherlands and
other European countries. Typically such plants have a capacity
of about 1 Mt waste/yr, moving grate boilers (which allow
mass burning of waste with diverse properties), low steam
pressures and temperatures (to avoid corrosion) and extensive
flue gas cleaning to conform with EU Directive 2000/76/EC. In
2002, European incinerators for waste-to-energy generated 41
million GJ electrical energy and 110 million GJ thermal energy

>20% with more efficient designs becoming available. In recent
years, more advanced combustion concepts have penetrated the

"A secondary control on landfill CH, emissions is CH,
oxidation by indigenous methanotrophic microorganisms in
cover soils. Landfill soils attain the highest rates of CH, oxidation
recorded in the literature, with rates many times higher than
in wetland settings. CH, oxidation rates at landfills can vary
over several orders of magnitude and range from negligible
to 100% of the CH, flux to the cover. Under circumstances of
high oxidation potential and low flux of landfill CH, from the
landfill, it has been demonstrated that atmospheric CH, may
be oxidized at the landfill surface (Bogner et al., 1995; 1997b;
1999; 2005; Borjesson and Svensson, 1997b). In such cases,
the landfill cover soils function as a sink rather than a source of
atmospheric CH. The thickness, physical properties moisture
content, and temperature of cover soils directly affect oxidation,
because rates are limited by the transport of CH, upward from
anaerobic zones and O, downward from the atmosphere.
Laboratory studies have shown that oxidation rates in landfill
cover soils may be as high as 150-250 g CH, /m?/d (Kightley
et al., 1995; de Visscher et al., 1999). Recent field studies have
demonstrated that oxidation rates can be greater than 200 g/
m?/d in thick, compost-amended ‘biocovers’ engineered to
optimize oxidation (Bogner et al., 2005; Huber-Humer, 2004).
The prototype biocover design includes an underlying coarse-
grained gas distribution layer to provide more uniform fluxes
to the biocover above (Huber-Humer, 2004). Furthermore,
engineered biocovers have been shown to effectively oxidize
CH, over multiple annual cycles in northern temperate climates
(Humer-Humer, 2004). In addition to biocovers, it is also
possible to design passive or active methanotrophic biofilters
to reduce landfill CH, emissions (Gebert and Gréngréft, 2006;
Streese and Stegmann, 2005). In field settings, stable C isotopic
techniques have proven extremely useful to quantify the fraction
of CH, that is oxidized in landfill cover soils (Chanton and
Liptay, 2000; de Visscher et al., 2004; Powelson et al., 2007).
A secondary benefit of CH, oxidation in cover soils is the co-
oxidation of many non-CH, organic compounds, especially
aromatic and lower chlorinated compounds, thereby reducing
their emissions to the atmosphere (Scheutz et al., 2003a).

biological treatment over landfilling are reduced volume and
more rapid waste stabilization. Depending on quality, the
residual solids can be recycled as fertilizer or soil amendments,

"Mechanical biological treatment (MBT) of waste is now
being widely implemented in Germany, Austria, Italy and other

approximately 13 million tonnes with larger plants having a

operations to reduce volume and achieve partial stabilization of
the organic carbon. Typically, mechanical operations (sorting,
shredding, crushing) first produce a series of waste fractions for
recycling or for subsequent treatment (including combustion or
secondary biological processes). The biological steps consist of
either aerobic composting or anaerobic digestion. Composting

references on Figure 10.1). Composting can be sustainable at
reasonable cost in developing countries; however, choosing
more labour-intensive processes over highly mechanized
technology at large scale is typically more appropriate and
sustainable; Hoornweg et al. (1999) give examples from India
and other countries. Depending on compost quality, there
are many potential applications for compost in agriculture,
horticulture, soil stabilization and soil improvement (increased
organic matter, higher water-holding capacity) (Cointreau,

"Quantifying the GHG-reduction benefits of waste
minimization, recycling and re-use requires the application
of LCA tools (Smith et al., 2001). Recycling reduces GHG
emissions through lower energy demand for production
(avoided fossil fuel) and by substitution of recycled feedstocks
for virgin materials. Efficient use of materials also reduces
waste. Material efficiency can be defined as a reduction in
primary materials for a particular purpose, such as packaging
or construction, with no negative impact on existing human
activities. At several stages in the life cycle of a product,
material efficiency can be increased by more efficient design,
material substitution, product recycling, material recycling and
quality cascading (use of recycled material for a secondary
product with lower quality demands). Both material recycling
and quality cascading occur in many countries at large scale
for metals recovery (steel, aluminium) and recycling of paper,
plastics and wood. All these measures lead to indirect energy
savings, reductions in GHG emissions, and avoidance of GHG
generation. This is especially true for products resulting from
energy-intensive production processes such as metals, glass,
plastic and paper (Tuhkanen et a/., 2001).

"In the waste sector, it is often not possible to clearly separate
costs for GHG mitigation from costs for waste management. In
addition, waste management costs can exhibit high variability
depending on local conditions. Therefore the baseline and cost
assumptions, local availability of technologies, and economic
and social development issues for alternative waste management
strategies need to be carefully defined. An older study by de
Jager and Blok (1996) assumed a 20-year project life to compare
the cost-effectiveness of various options for mitigating CH,
emissions from waste in the Netherlands, with costs ranging
from —2 US$/tCO,-eq for landfilling with gas recovery and on-
site electrical generation to >370 US$/tCO,-eq for incineration.
In general, for landfill CH, recovery and utilization, project
economics are highly site-specific and dependent on the financial
arrangements as well as the distribution of benefits, risks and
responsibilities among multiple partners. Some representative
unit costs for landfill-gas recovery and utilization (all in
2003 US$/kW installed power) are: 200-400 for gas collection;
200-300 for gas conditioning (blower/compressor, dehydration,

250-350 for planning and design (Willumsen, 2003).

"Smith et al. (2001) highlighted major cost differences
between EU member states for mitigating GHG emissions
from waste. Based on fees (including taxes) for countries with
data, this study compared emissions and costs for various waste
management practices with respect to direct GHG emissions,
carbon sequestration, transport emissions, avoided emissions
from recycling due to material and energy savings, and avoided
emissions from fossil-fuel substitution via thermal processes
and biogas (including landfill gas). Recycling costs are highly
dependent on the waste material recycled. Overall, the financial
success of any recycling venture is dependent on the current
market value of the recycled products. The price obtained
for recovered materials is typically lower than separation/
reprocessing costs, which can be, in turn, higher than the
cost of virgin materials — thus recycling activities usually
require subsidies (except for aluminium and paper recycling).
Recycling, composting and anaerobic digestion can provide
large potential emission reductions, but further implementation
is dependent on reducing the cost of separate collection (10—
400 €/t waste (9-380 US$/t)) and, for composting, establishing
local markets for the compost product. Costs for composting
can range from 20-170 €/t waste (18-156 US$/t) and are
typically 35 €/t waste (32 US$/t) for open-windrow operations
and 50 €/t waste (46 US$/t) for in-vessel processes. When
the replaced fossil fuel is coal, both mass incineration and

"Wastewater treatment removes pollutants using a variety
of technologies. Small wastewater treatment systems include
pit latrines, composting toilets and septic tanks. Septic tanks

used in developing countries include inverted trench systems
and aerated treatment units. More advanced treatment systems
include activated sludge treatment, trickling filters, anaerobic
or facultative lagoons, anaerobic digestion and constructed
wetlands. Depending on scale, many of these systems have been
used in both developed and developing countries. Activated
sludge treatment is considered the conventional method for
large-scale treatment of sewage. In addition, separation of black
water and grey water can reduce the overall energy requirements
for treatment (UNEP/GPA-UNESCO/IHE, 2004). Pretreatment
or limitation of industrial wastes is often necessary to limit
excessive pollutant loads to municipal systems, especially
when wastewaters are contaminated with heavy metals. Sludges
(or biosolids) are the product of most wastewater treatment
systems. Options for sludge treatment include stabilization,
thickening, dewatering, anaerobic digestion, agricultural re-
use, drying and incineration. The use of composted sludge as a
soil conditioner in agriculture and horticulture recycles carbon,
nitrogen and phosphorus (and other elements essential for plant
growth). Heavy metals and some toxic chemicals are difficult
to remove from sludge; either the limitation of industrial inputs
or wastewater pretreatment is needed for agricultural use of
sludges. Lower quality uses for sludge may include mine site
rehabilitation, highway landscaping, or landfill cover (including
biocovers). Some sludges are landfilled, but this practice may
result in increased volatile siloxanes and H,S in the landfill gas.
Treated wastewater can either be re-used or discharged, but re-

growth in emissions to 2020 is more moderate than in Monni
et al. (2006). This more moderate growth can be attributed to
the inclusion of current and planned policies and measures to
reduce emissions, plus the fact that historical emissions from
prior landfilled waste were only partially considered.

"Costs and potentials for reducing GHG emissions from
waste are usually based on landfill CH, as the baseline (Bates
and Haworth, 2001; Delhotal et al. 2006; Monni et al. 2006;
Nakicenovic et al., 2000; Pipatti and Wihersaari 1998). When
reporting to the UNFCCC, most developed countries take the
dynamics of landfill gas generation into account; however, most
developing countries and non-reporting countries do not. Basing
their study on reported emissions and projections, Delhotal et
al. (2006) estimated break-even costs for GHG abatement from
landfill gas utilization that ranged from about —20 to +70 US$/
tCO,-eq, with the lower value for direct use in industrial
boilers and the higher value for on-site electrical generation.
From the same study, break-even costs (all in US$/tCO-eq)
were approximately 25 for landfill-gas flaring; 240-270 for
composting; 40-430 for anaerobic digestion; 360 for MBT and
270 for incineration. These costs were based on the EMF-21
study (US EPA, 2003), which assumed a 15-year technology
lifetime, 10% discount rate and 40% tax rate.
"	Text
"Compared to thermal and biological processes which only
affect future emissions, landfill CH, is generated from waste
landfilled in previous decades, and gas recovery, in turn, reduces
emissions from waste landfilled in previous years. Most existing
studies for the waste sector do not consider these temporal
issues. Monni et al. (2006) developed baseline and mitigation
scenarios for solid waste management using the first order decay
(FOD) methodology in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, which takes
into account the timing of emissions. The baseline scenario
by Monni et al. (2006) assumed that: 1) waste generation will
increase with growing population and GDP (using the same
population and GDP data as SRES scenario Alb); 2) waste
management strategies will not change significantly, and 3)
landfill gas recovery and utilization will continue to increase at
the historical rate of 5% per year in developed countries (Bogner
and Matthews, 2003; Willumsen, 2003). Mitigation scenarios
were developed for 2030 and 2050 which focus on increased
landfill gas recovery, increased recycling, and increased
incineration. In the increased landfill gas recovery scenario,
recovery was estimated to increase 15% per year, with most of
the increase in developing countries because of CDM or similar
incentives (above baseline of current CDM projects). This
growth rate is about triple the current rate and corresponds to a
reasonable upper limit, taking into account the fact that recovery
in developed countries has already reached high levels, so that
increases would come mainly from developing countries, where
current lack of funding is a barrier to deployment. Landfill gas
"	Text
"recovery was capped at 75% of estimated annual CH, generation
for developed countries and 50% for developing countries in
both the baseline and increased landfill gas recovery scenarios.
In the increased incineration scenario, incineration grew 5%
each year in the countries where waste incineration occurred in
2000. For OECD countries where no incineration took place in
2000, 1% of the waste generated was assumed to be incinerated
in 2012. In non-OECD countries, 1% waste incineration was
assumed to be reached only in 2030. The maximum rate of
incineration that could be implemented was 85% of the waste
generated. The increased recycling scenario assumed a growth
in paper and cardboard recycling in all parts of the world using
a technical maximum of 60% recycling (CEPI, 2003). This
maximum was assumed to be reached in 2050. In the mitigation
scenarios, only direct emission reductions compared to the
baseline CH, emissions from landfills were estimated — thus
avoided emissions from recycled materials, reduced energy
use, or fossil fuel offsets were not included. In the baseline
scenario (Figure 10.8), emissions increase threefold during
the period from 1990 to 2030 and more than fivefold by 2050.
These growth rates do not include current or planned legislation
relating to either waste minimization or landfilling — thus future
emissions may be overestimated. Most of the increase comes
from non-OECD countries whose current emissions are smaller
because of lower waste generation and a higher percentage of
waste degrading aerobically. The mitigation scenarios show
that reductions by individual measures in 2030 range from 5—
20% of total emissions and increase proportionally with time.
In 2050, the corresponding range is approximately 10-30%.
As the measures in the scenarios are largely additive, total
mitigation potentials of approximately 30% in 2030 and 50%
in 2050 are projected relative to the baseline. Nevertheless, the
estimated abatement potential is not capable of mitigating the
growth in emissions.

"Delhotal et al. (2006) and Monni et al. (2006) both conclude
that substantial emission reductions can be achieved at low or
negative costs (see Table 10.4). At higher costs, more significant
reductions would be possible (more than 80% of baseline
emissions) with most of the additional mitigation potential
coming from thermal processes for waste-to-energy. Since
combustion of waste results in minor fossil CO, emissions,
these were considered in the calculations, but Table 10.4 only
includes emissions reductions from landfill CH,. In general,
direct GHG emission reductions from implementation of thermal
processes are much less than indirect reductions due to fossil
fuel replacement, where that occurs. The emission reduction
potentials for 2030 shown in Table 10.4 are assessed using a
steady-state approach that can overestimate near-term annual
reductions but gives more realistic values when integrated over

"In the anaerobic landfill environment, some fluorinated gases
may be biodegraded because CFCs and, to some extent, HCFCs
can undergo dechlorination (Scheutz et a/., 2003b). Potentially
this may result in the production of more toxic intermediate
degradation products (e.g., for CFC-11, the degradation products
can be HCFC-21 and HCFC-31). However, recent laboratory
experiments have indicated rapid CFC-11 degradation with
only minor production of toxic intermediates (Scheutz et al.,
2005b). HFCs have not been shown to undergo either anaerobic
or aerobic degradation. Thus, landfill attenuation processes may
decrease emissions of some fluorinated gases, but not of others.
However, data are entirely lacking for PFCs, and field studies
are needed to verify that CFCs and HCFCs are being attenuated
in situ in order to guide future policy decisions.

"Consumer products containing fluorinated gases are managed
in different ways. After 2001, landfill disposal of appliances
was prohibited in the EU (IPCC, 2005), resulting in appliance-
recycling facilities. A similar system was established in Japan
in 2001 (IPCC, 2005). For other developed countries, appliance
foams are often buried in landfills, either directly or following
shredding and metals recycling. For rigid foams, shredding
results in an instantaneous release with the fraction released
related to the final particle size (Kjeldsen and Scheutz, 2003). A
recent study estimating CFC-11 releases after shredding at three
American facilities showed that 60-90% of the CFC remains
and is slowly released following landfill disposal (Scheutz et
al., 2005a). In the US and other countries, appliances typically
undergo mechanical recovery of ferrous metals with landfill
disposal of residuals. A study has shown that 840% of the CFC-
11 is lost during segregation (Scheutz et al., 2002; Fredenslund
et al., 2005). Then, during landfilling, the compactors shred
residual foam materials and further enhance instantaneous
gaseous releases.

"The CFCs and HCFCs regulated as ozone-depleting
substances (ODS) under the Montreal Protocol can persist
for many decades in post-consumer waste and occur as trace
components in landfill gas (Scheutz et al., 2003). The HFCs
regulated under the Kyoto Protocol are promoted as substitutions
for the ODS. High global-warming potential (GWP) fluorinated
gases have been used for more than 70 years; the most important
are the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons
(HCFCs) and the hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) with the existing
bank of CFCs and HCFCs estimated to be >1.5 Mt and 0.75 Mt,
respectively (TFFEoL, 2005; IPCC, 2005). These gases have
been used as refrigerants, solvents, blowing agents for foams
and as chemical intermediates. End-of-life issues in the waste
sector are mainly relevant for the foams; for other products,
release will occur during use or just after end-of-life. For the
rigid foams, releases during use are small (Kjeldsen and Jensen,
2001, Kjeldsen and Scheutz, 2003, Scheutz et a/, 2003b), so most
of the original content is still present at the end of their useful
life. The rigid foams include polyurethane and polystyrene used
as insulation in appliances and buildings; in these, CFC-11 and
CFC-12 were the main blowing agents until the mid-1990s.
After the mid-1990s, HCFC-22, HCFC-141b and HCFC-142b
with HFC-134a have been used (CALEB, 2000). Considering
that home appliances are the foam-containing product with the
lowest lifetime (average maximum lifetime 15 years, TFFEoL,
2005), a significant fraction of the CFC-11 in appliances has
already entered waste management systems. Building insulation
has a much longer lifetime (estimated to 30-80 years, Gamlen
et al., 1986) and most of the fluorinated gases in building
insulation have not yet reached the end of their useful life
(TFFEoL, 2005). Daniel et al. (2007) discuss the uncertainties
and some possible temporal trends for depletion of CFC-11 and
CFC-12 banks.

"GHG emissions from waste are directly affected by numerous
policy and regulatory strategies that encourage energy recovery
from waste, restrict choices for ultimate waste disposal, promote
waste recycling and re-use, and encourage waste minimization.
In many developed countries, especially Japan and the EU,
waste-management policies are closely related to and integrated
with climate policies. Although policy instruments within
the waste sector consist mainly of regulations, there are also
economic measures to promote recycling, waste minimization
and selected waste management technologies. In industrialized
countries, waste minimization and recycling are encouraged
through both policy and regulatory drivers. In developing
countries, major policies are aimed at restricting the uncontrolled
dumping of waste. Table 10.6 provides an overview of policies
and measures, some of which are discussed below.

"There are two major strategies to reduce landfill CH,
emissions: implementation of standards that require or
encourage landfill CH, recovery and a reduction in the quantity
of biodegradable waste that is landfilled. In the US, landfill CH,
emissions are regulated indirectly under the Clean Air Act (CAA)
Amendments/New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) by
applying a landfill-gas generation model, either measured or
default mixing ratios for total non-methane organic compounds
(NMOCs), and restricting the emissions of NMOCs. Larger
quantities of landfill CH, are also being annually recovered to
both comply with air-quality regulations and provide energy,
assisted by national tax credits and local renewable-energy/
green-power initiatives. As discussed above, the EU landfill
directive (1999/3 1/EC) requires a phased reduction in landfilled
biodegradable waste to 50% of 1995 levels by 2009 and 35%
by 2016, as well as the collection and flaring of landfill gas at
existing sites (Commission of the European Community, 2001).
However, increases in the availability of landfill alternatives
(recycling, composting, incineration, anaerobic digestion and
MBT) are required to achieve these regulatory goals (Price,
2001).
"	Text
"Landfill CH, recovery has also been encouraged by
economic and regulatory incentives. In the UK, for example,
the Non Fossil Fuel Obligation, requiring a portion of electrical
generation capacity from non-fossil sources, provided a major
incentive for landfill gas-to-electricity projects during the
1980s and 1990s. It has now been replaced by the Renewables
Obligation. In the US, as mentioned above, the implementation
of CAA regulations in the early 1990s provided a regulatory
driver for gas recovery at large landfills; in parallel, the US
EPA Landfill Methane Outreach Program provides technical
support, tools and resources to facilitate landfill gas utilization
projects in the US and abroad. Also, periodic tax credits in
the US have provided an economic incentive for landfill gas
utilization — for example, almost 50 of the 400+ commercial
projects in the US started up in 1998, just before the expiration
of federal tax credits. A small US tax credit has again become
available for landfill gas and other renewable energy sources; in
addition, some states also provide economic incentives through
tax structures or renewable energy credits and bonds. Other
drivers include state requirements that a portion of electrical
energy be derived from renewables, green-power programmes
(which allow consumers to select renewable providers), regional
programmes to reduce GHG emissions (the RGGI/ Regional
GHG Initiative in the northeastern states; a state programme in
California) and voluntary markets (such as the Chicago Climate
Exchange with binding commitments by members to reduce
GHG emissions).

In Sweden, it has been illegal to landfill pre-sorted combustible

of EU countries to elevate the cost of landfilling to encourage
more costly alternatives (incineration, industrial co-combustion,

mechanism for environmental and community projects, as

"Widely implemented policies include Extended Producer

and landfill taxes. Waste reduction can also be promoted by
recycling programmes, waste minimization and other measures
(Miranda et al., 1994; Fullerton and Kinnaman, 1996). The
EPR regulations extend producer responsibility to the post-
consumer period, thus providing a strong incentive to redesign
products using fewer materials as well as those with increased
recycling potential (OECD, 2001). Initially, EPR programmes
were reported to be expensive (Hanisch, 2000), but the EPR
concept is very broad: a number of successful schemes have
been implemented in various countries for diverse waste
fractions such as packaging waste, old vehicles and electronic
equipment. EPR programmes range in complexity and cost,
but waste reductions have been reported in many countries and
regions. In Germany, the 1994 Closed Substance Cycle and
Waste Management Act, other laws and voluntary agreements
have restructured waste management over the past 15 years
(Giegrich and Vogt, 2005).

"The EIT and many developing countries have implemented
market-oriented structural reforms that affect GHG emissions.
As GDP is a key parameter to predict waste generation
(Daskalopoulos et al., 1998), economic growth affects the
consumption of materials, the production of waste, and
hence GHG emissions from the waste sector. Decoupling
waste generation from economic and demographic drivers,
or dematerialization, is often discussed in the context of
sustainable development. Many developed countries have
reported recent decoupling trends (OECD, 2002a), but the
literature shows no absolute decline in material consumption
in developed countries (Bringezu et al., 2004). In other words,
solid waste generation does not support an environmental
Kuznets curve (Dinda, 2004), because environmental problems
related to waste are not fully internalized. In Asia, Japan and
China are both encouraging ‘circular economy’ or ‘sound
material-cycle society’ as a new development strategy, whose
core concept is the circular (closed) flow of materials and the
use of raw materials and energy through multiple phases (Japan
Ministry of the Environment, 2003; Yuan et al., 2006). This
approach is expected to achieve efficient economic growth
while discharging fewer pollutants.
"	Text
"countries, the JI and CDM have been useful mechanisms for
obtaining external investment from industrialized countries.
As described in Section 10.3, open dumping and burning are
common waste disposal methods in many developing countries,
where GHG emissions occur concurrently with odours, public
health and safety problems, and environmental degradation.
In addition, developing countries often do not have existing
infrastructure for collection and treatment of municipal
wastewaters. Thus, the benefits from JI and CDM are twofold:
improving waste management practices and reducing GHG
emissions. To date, CDM has assisted many landfill gas recovery
projects (see Box 10.2) while improving landfill operations,
because adequate cover materials are required to minimize
air intrusion during gas extraction (to prevent internal landfill
fires). The validation of CDM projects requires attention to
baselines, additionality and other criteria contained in approved
methodologies (Hiramatsu et al/., 2003); however, for landfill
gas CDM projects, certified emission reductions (CERs, with
units of tCO2-eq) are determined directly from quantification
of the CH, captured and combusted. In many countries, the
anaerobic digestion of wastewaters and sludges could produce
a useful biogas for heating use or onsite electrical generation
(Government of Japan, 1997; Government of Republic of
Poland, 2001); such projects could also be suitable for JI and
CDM. In the future, waste sector projects involving municipal
wastewater treatment, carbon storage in landfills or compost,
and avoided GHG emissions due to recycling, composting,
or incineration could potentially be implemented pending the
development of approved methodologies.

"increasingly being implemented for landfill gas recovery
projects, provides a major incentive for both improved waste
management and GHG emission reductions. For the long term,
more profound changes in waste management strategy are
expected in both developed and developing countries, including
more emphasis on waste minimization, recycling, re-use and
energy recovery. Huhtala (1997) studied optimal recycling
rates for municipal solid waste using a model that included
recycling costs and consumer preferences; results suggested
that a recycling rate of 50% was achievable, economically
justified and environmentally preferable. This rate has already
been achieved in many countries for the more valuable waste
fractions such as metals and paper (OECD, 2002b).

"Advances in waste-to-energy have benefited from general
advances in biomass combustion; thus the more advanced
technologies such as fluidized bed combustion with emissions
control can provide significant future mitigation potential for
the waste sector. When the fossil fuel offset is also taken into
account, the positive impact on GHG reduction can be even
greater (e.g., Lohiniva et a/. 2002; Pipatti and Savolainen 1996;
Consonni et al. 2005). High cost, however, is a major barrier to
the increased implementation of waste-to-energy. Incineration
has often proven to be unsustainable in developing countries
— thus thermal processes are expected to be primarily (but
not exclusively) deployed in developed countries. Advanced
combustion technologies are expected to become more
competitive as energy prices increase and renewable energy
sources gain larger market share.

"to composting, anaerobic digestion has advantages with respect
to energy benefits (biogas), reduced process times and reduced
volume of residuals; however, as applied in developed countries,
it typically incurs higher capital costs. Projects where mixed
municipal waste was anaerobically digested (e.g., the Valorga
project) have been largely discontinued in favour of projects
using specific biodegradable fractions such as food waste. In
some developing countries such as China and India, small-scale
digestion of biowaste streams with CH, recovery and use has
been successfully deployed for decades as an inexpensive local
waste-to-energy strategy — many other countries could also
benefit from similar small-scale projects. For both as a primary
wastewater treatment process or for secondary treatment of
sludges from aerobic processes, anaerobic digestion under
higher temperature using thermophilic regimes or two-stage
processes can provide shorter retention times with higher rates
of biogas production.
"	Text
"Decisions for alternative waste management strategies are
often made locally; however, there are also regional drivers
based on national regulatory and policy decisions. Selected waste
management options also determine GHG mitigation options.
For the many countries which continue to rely on landfilling,
increased utilization of landfill CH, can provide a cost-effective
mitigation strategy. The combination of gas utilization for
energy with biocover landfill cover designs to increase CH,
oxidation can largely mitigate site-specific CH, emissions
(Huber-Humer, 2004; Barlaz et al., 2004). These technologies
are simple (‘low technology’) and can be readily deployed at
any site. Moreover, R&D to improve gas-collection efficiency,
design biogas engines and turbines with higher efficiency, and
develop more cost-effective gas purification technologies are
underway. These improvements will be largely incremental
but will increase options, decrease costs, and remove existing
barriers for expanded applications of these technologies.
"	Text
"Regarding the future of up-front recycling and separation
technologies, it is expected that wider implementation of
incrementally-improving technologies will provide more
rigorous process control forrecycled waste streams transported to
secondary markets or secondary processes, including paper and
aluminium recycling, composting and incineration. If analysed
within an LCA perspective, waste can be considered a resource,
and these improvements should result in more advantageous
material and energy balances for both individual components
and urban waste streams as a whole. For developing countries,
provided sufficient measures are in place to protect workers and
the local environment, more labour-intensive recycling practices
can be introduced and sustained to conserve materials, gain
energy benefits and reduce GHG emissions. In general, existing
studies on the mitigation potential for recycling yield variable
results because of the differing assumptions and methodologies
applied; however, recent studies (i.e., Myllymaa et al., 2005) are
beginning to quantitatively examine the environmental benefits
of alternative waste strategies, including recycling.

expand sanitation coverage; for example, in India more than
one million pit latrines have been built and maintained since
1970 (Lenton et al., 2005). The combination of household

sanitation approaches (including ecological toilets), where
nutrients are safely recycled into productive agriculture and the
environment, are being used in Mexico, Zimbabwe, China, and
Sweden (Esrey et al., 2003). These could also be applied in many
developing and developed countries, especially where there are
water shortages, irregular water supplies, or where additional
measures for conservation of water resources are needed. All
of these measures also encourage smaller wastewater treatment
plants with reduced nutrient loads and proportionally lower
GHG emissions.

In Chapters 4 to 10, the emissions avoided as a result of the electricity saved in various mitigation options are attributed to the end-use sectors using average carbon content for

power generation.
In ‘point-of-emission’ attribution, as adopted in Chapter 4, all emissions from power generation are attributed to the energy sector.
The forestry chapter also notes that a continuous rise in carbon prices poses a problem: forest sequestration might be deferred to increase profits given higher prices in the future.

Seen from this perspective, a more rapid carbon price rise followed by a period of stable carbon prices could encourage more sequestration.

"No one sector or technology can address the entire mitigation
challenge. This suggests that a diversified portfolio is required
based on a variety of criteria. All the main sectors contribute
to the total. In the lower-cost range, and measured according
to end-use attribution,! the potentials for electricity savings
are largest in buildings and agriculture. When attribution is
based on point of emission,? energy supply makes the largest
contribution (high agreement, much evidence).

The aim of geo-engineering options is to remove CO,
directly from the air, for example through ocean fertilization, or
to block sunlight. However, little is known about effectiveness,
costs or potential side-effects of the options. Blocking sunlight
does not affect the expected escalation in atmospheric CO,
levels, but could reduce or eliminate the associated warming.
Disconnecting CO, concentration and global temperature in this
way could induce other effects, such as the further acidification
of the oceans (medium agreement, limited evidence).

"Pathways towards 650ppm CO,-eq (Category IV levels; see
Table 3.10) could be compatible with such price levels being

Ill and IV, which returns emissions to present levels by 2050,
would require global carbon prices to rise to 25 US$/tCO, by
2030 and be maintained at this level along with substantial
investment in low-carbon energy technologies and supply (high

These estimates assume that bioenergy options will be
important for many sectors by 2030, with substantial growth
potential beyond, although no complete integrated studies
are available for supply-demand balances. The usefulness of
these options depends on the development of biomass capacity
(energy crops) in balance with investments in agricultural
practices, logistic capacity, and markets, together with the
commercialization of second-generation biofuel production.
Sustainable biomass production and use imply the resolution of

The economic potentials for GHG mitigation at different
costs have been reviewed for 2030 on the basis of bottom-up
studies. The review confirms the Third Assessment Report
(TAR) finding that there are substantial opportunities for
mitigation levels of about 6 GtCO,-eq involving net benefits
(costs less than 0), with a large share being located in the
buildings sector. Additional potentials are 7 GtCO,-eq at a unit
cost (carbon price) of less than 20 US$/tCO,-eq, with the total,
low-cost, potential being in the range of 9 to 18 GtCO,-eq. The
total range is estimated to be 13 to 26 GtCO)-eq, at a cost of
less than 50 US$/tCO,-eq and 16 to 31 GtCO,-eq at a cost of
less than 100 US$/tCO,-eq (370 US$/tC-eq). As reported in
Chapter 3, these ranges are comparable with those suggested by
the top-down models for these carbon prices by 2030, although
there are differences in sectoral attribution (medium agreement,
medium evidence).

Diverse evidence indicates that carbon prices in the range
20-50 US$/tCO, (US$75-185/tC), reached globally by 2020-
2030 and sustained or increased thereafter, would deliver deep
emission reductions by mid-century consistent with stabilization
at around 550ppm CO,-eq (Category III levels, see Table 3.10)
if implemented in a stable and predictable fashion. Such prices
would deliver these emission savings by creating incentives large
enough to switch ongoing investment in the world’s electricity
systems to low-carbon options, to promote additional energy
efficiency, and to halt deforestation and reward afforestation.
For purposes of comparison, it can be pointed out that prices in
the EU ETS in 2005-2006 varied between 6 and 40 US$/tCO,.
The emission reductions will be greater (or the price levels
required for a given trajectory lower in the range indicated) to
the extent that carbon prices are accompanied by expanding
investment in technology RD&D and targeted market-building
incentives (high agreement, much evidence).

Estimates of ‘carbon leakage rates for action under Kyoto
range from 5 to 20% as a result ofa loss of price competitiveness,
but they remain very uncertain. The potential beneficial effect
of technology transfer to developing countries arising from
technological development brought about by Annex | action
may be substantial for energy-intensive industries. However,
it has not yet been quantified reliably. As far as existing
mitigation actions, such as the EU ETS, are concerned, the
empirical evidence seems to indicate that competitive losses
are not significant, confirming a finding in the TAR (medium
agreement, limited evidence).

that are appropriate to different stages of technology
development, with multiple and mutually supporting policies

development of cost-effective technologies will be rewarded
by well-designed carbon tax or cap and trade schemes through
increased profitability and deployment. Even so, in some cases,
the short-term market response to climate policies may lock in
existing technologies and inhibit the adoption of more fruitful
options in the longer term (high agreement, much evidence).

"Attempts to balance emission reductions equally across
sectors (without trading) are likely to be more costly than an
approach primarily guided by cost efficiency. Another general
finding is that costs will be reduced if policies that correct the
two relevant market failures are combined by incorporating the
damage resulting from climate change in carbon prices, and the
benefits of technological innovation in support for low-carbon
innovation. An example is the recycling of revenues from
tradeable permit auctions to support energy efficiency and low-
carbon innovations. Low-carbon technologies can also diversify
technology portfolios, thereby reducing risk (high agreement,

"Mitigation is not a discrete action: investment, in higher or
lower carbon options, is occurring all the time. The estimated
investment required is around $20 trillion in the energy sector
alone out to 2030. Many energy sector and land use investments
cover several decades; buildings, urban and_ transport
infrastructure, and some industrial equipment may influence
emission patterns over the century. Emission trajectories and
the potential to achieve stabilization levels, particularly in
Categories A and B, will be heavily influenced by the nature
of these investments. Diverse policies that deter investment
in long-lived carbon-intensive infrastructure and reward low-
carbon investment could maintain options for these stabilization
levels at lower costs (high agreement, much evidence).

Co-benefits of action in the form of reduced air pollution,
more energy security or more rural employment offset mitigation
costs. While the studies use different methodological approaches,
there is general consensus for all world regions analyzed that
near-term health and other benefits from GHG reductions can
be substantial, both in industrialized and developing countries.
However, the benefits are highly dependent on the policies,
technologies and sectors chosen. In developing countries,
much of the health benefit could result from improvements in
the efficiency of, or switching away from, the traditional use of
coal and biomass. Such near-term co-benefits of GHG control
provide the opportunity for a true no-regrets GHG reduction

reduce building energy consumption (Section 6.4.6). IT is also
the key to the performance of hybrids and other advanced vehicle
technologies (Section 5.3.1.2). Smart end-use devices (household
appliances, etc) could use IT to program their operation at times
when electricity demand is low. This could reduce peak demand
for electricity, resulting in a shift to base load generation, which
is usually more efficient (Hirst, 2006). The impact of such
a switch on CO), emissions is unknown, because it is easy to
construct cases where shifts from peak load to base load would
increase CO, emissions (e.g., natural-gas-fired peak load, but
coal-fired base load). General improvements in IT, e.g. cheaper
computer chips, will benefit all sectors, but applications have to
be tailored to the specific end-use. Of course, the net impact of IT
on greenhouse gas emissions could result either in net reductions
or gains, depending for example on whether or not efficiency
gains are offset by increases in production.

"An example of a group of technologies that could involve
interaction between sectors is gasification/hydrogen/carbon
dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technology (IPCC, 2005
and Chapter 4.3.6). While these technologies can be discussed
separately, they are interrelated and being applied as a group
enhances their CO-emission mitigation potential. For example,
CCS can be applied as a post-combustion technology, in which
case it will increase the amount of resource needed to generate
a unit of heat or electricity. Using a pre-combustion approach,
ie. gasifying fossil fuels to produce hydrogen that can be used
in fuel cells or directly in combustion engines, may improve
overall energy efficiency. However, unless CCS is used to
mitigate the CO, by-product from this process, the use of that
hydrogen will offer only modest benefits. (See Section 5.3.1.4
for a comparison of fuel cell and hybrid vehicles.) Adding CCS
would make hydrogen an energy carrier, providing a low CO,
emission approach for transportation, buildings, or industrial
applications. Implementation of fuel cells in stationary
applications could provide valuable learning for vehicle
application; in addition, fuel cell vehicles could provide electric
power to homes and buildings (Romeri, 2004).

and vertical transport of the increased phytoplankton biomass
to depths below the main thermocline (>120m). The efficiency
of sequestration of the phytoplankton carbon is low (<10%),
with the biomass being largely recycled back to CO, in the
upper water column (Boyd et al., 2004). This suggests that the
field-study estimates of the actual carbon sequestered per unit
iron (and per dollar) are over-estimates. The cost of large-scale
and long-term fertilization will also be offset by CO, release/
emission during the acquisition, transportation and release
of large volumes of iron in remote oceanic regions. Potential
negative effects of iron fertilization include the increased
production of methane and nitrous oxide, deoxygenation of
intermediate waters and changes in phytoplankton community
composition that may cause toxic blooms and/or promote
changes further along the food chain. None of these effects
have been directly identified in experiments to date, partly due
to the time and space constraints.

"techniques are considered:

A. Deflector System at Earth-Sun L-14 point. The principle
underlying this idea (e.g. Seifritz (1989), Teller et al. (2004),
Angel (2006)) is to install a barrier to sunlight measuring
about 106 km? at or close to the L-1 point. Teller eg al.
estimate that its mass would be about 3000 t, consisting of
a 30um metallic screen with 25nm ribs.> They envisage it
being spun in situ, and emplaced by one shuttle flight a year
over 100 years. It should have essentially zero maintenance.
The cost has not yet been determined. Computations by
Govindasamy et al. (2003) suggest that this scheme could
markedly reduce regional and seasonal climate change.

B. Stratospheric Reflecting Aerosols. This technique involves
the controlled scattering of incoming sunlight with airborne
sub-microscopic particles that would have a stratospheric
residence time of about 5 years. Teller et al. (2004) suggest
that the particles could be: (a) dielectrics; (b) metals; (c)
resonant scatterers. Crutzen (2006) proposes (d) sulphur
particles. The implications of these schemes, particularly
with regard to stratospheric chemistry, feasibility and costs,
require further assessment (Cicerone, 2006).

In the case of the WEO2004, for example, the oil price assumed
in 2030 is 29 US$/barrel. These prices (and all other energy price
assumptions) are substantially lower than those prevailing in
2006 and assumed for later projections (IEA, 2005 and 2006b).
The 2002-6 rises in world energy prices are also reflected in
the energy futures markets for at least another five to ten years.
In fact, the rise in crude oil prices during this period, some 50

whether these price increases will have a significant impact on

The emissions in the year 2004 as reported in the sectoral chapters and Chapter 1, Figure 1.3a/b.

The allocation to point of emission means that the emissions are allocated to the sector where the emission takes place. For example, electricity emissions
are allocated to the power sector. There is a difference between the sum when allocating the emissions in different ways. This is explained by the exclusion
of electricity emissions from the agricultural and transport sectors due to lack of data and by the exclusion of emissions from conversion of energy as most
end-use emissions are based on final energy supply.

‘Allocated to the end-use sector’ means that the emissions are allocated to the sectors that use the energy. For example, electricity emissions are allocated
to the end-use sectors, mainly buildings and industry. Emissions from extraction and distribution are not included here.

See text for further clarification on the type of baselines used.

This figure is based on the assumption that the share of electricity-related emissions in the constructed baseline in Chapter 6 is the same as for the SRES B2
scenario. According to Price et al. (2006), the electricity-related emissions amount to 59%. 59% of the baseline (14.3 GtCO2-eq) is 8.4 GtCO2-eq.

The remaining emissions are allocated to the buildings sector.

2030 emissions of the F-gases are not available for the Transport, Buildings, and Energy Supply sectors.

Source: Price et al., 2006.

No baseline emissions for the year 2030 from the forestry sector are reported. See 9.4.3. On the basis of top-down models, it can be expected that the
emissions in 2030 will be similar to 2004.

The data for waste include waste disposal, wastewater and incineration. The emissions from wastewater treatment are for the years 2005 and 2020.

The emissions from conversion losses are not included due to lack of data.

Note that the peat fires and other bog fires, as mentioned in Chapter 1, are not included here. Nor are they included in Chapters 8 and 9.

from 1) additional new capacity between 2010 and 2030 and

"To overcome this problem, the following approach was
adopted: The World Energy Outlook (IEA, 2004) for the year
2030 was used as the baseline. The potentials from electricity
savings in the buildings and the industry sectors were estimated
first. Electricity savings then reduce demand for electricity.
This sequence was followed because electricity savings can be
achieved at relatively low cost and their implementation can
therefore be expected first. Electricity savings were converted
to emission reductions using the average carbon intensity
of the electricity supply in the baseline for the year 2030.
In reality, it can be expected that electricity savings would
result in a relatively larger reduction in fossil-fuel electricity
generation than electricity generation involving low marginal
costs such as renewables and nuclear. This is because, in the
operating system, low-cost generation is normally called on
before high-cost generation. However, this response depends
on local conditions and it is not appropriate to consider it
here. However, it does imply that the emission reductions for
electricity savings reported here are an under-estimate. This
under-estimate becomes more pronounced with higher carbon
prices, and higher marginal costs for fossil fuels.

". The new electricity supply required was divided between
available low-carbon supply options. As the cost estimates
were lowest for a fuel switch from coal to natural gas supply,
it was assumed that this would take place first. In accordance
with Chapter 4 it was assumed that 20% of the new coal
plants required would be substituted by gas technologies.

. An assessment was made of the prevented emissions
from the other low-carbon substitution options after the
fuel switch. The following technologies were taken into
account: renewables (wind and geothermal), bioenergy,
hydro, nuclear and CCS. It was assumed that the fossil
fuel requirement in the baseline (after adjustments for
the previous step) was met by these low-carbon intensive
technologies. The substitution was made on the basis of
relative maximum technical potential. The same breakdown
as in Section 4.4.3 was used for the low-carbon options.

. It was then possible to estimate the resulting mitigation
potential for the energy sector, after savings in the end-use
sectors buildings and industry.

. For the buildings and industry sectors, the mitigation
potential was broken down into emission savings resulting
from less electricity use and the remainder.

given in the chapters were used for the overall aggregation.

possible competing uses (for example, the increased use of
biomaterials such as fibreboard production from forest residues
and the use of agro-residues for fodder and fertilizer) and
differing assumptions about the sustainability criteria deployed
with respect to forest management and agriculture intensity.
The current energy potential of waste is approximately 8 EJ/yr,

"Demand for biomass as transportation fuel involves the
production of biofuels from agricultural crops such as sugar cane,
rape seed, corn, etc., as well as potentially “second-generation’
biofuels produced from lignocellulosic biomass. The first category
dominates in the shorter term. The penetration of second-generation
biofuels depends on the speed of technological development and
the market penetration of gasification technology for synfuels and
hydrolysis technology for the production of ethanol from woody
biomass. Demand projections for primary biomass in Chapter 5
are largely based on WEO-IEA (2006) global projections, with a
relatively wide range of about 14 to 40 EJ of primary biomass, or
8-25 EJ of fuel. However, there are also higher estimates ranging
from 45 to 85 EJ demand for primary biomass in 2030 (or roughly
30-50 EJ of fuel) (see Chapter 5).

of efficient gasification/combined cycle technology that could
strongly improve efficiencies in, for example, pulp and sugar
mills. Mitigation potentials reducing the demand for such
commodities or raising the recycling rate for paper will not result
in additional biomass demand. Biomass can also be used for the
production of chemicals and plastics, and as a reducing agent
for steel production (charcoal) and for construction purposes

Those potentials are accompanied by considerable uncertainties.
In addition, the estimates are derived from scenarios for the year
2050. The largest contribution could come from energy crops on
arable land, assuming that efficiency improvements in agriculture
are fast enough to outpace food demand so as to avoid increased
pressure on forests and nature areas. Section 8.4.4.2 provides
a range from 20-400 EJ. The highest estimate is a technical
potential for 2050. Technically, the potentials for such efficiency
increases are very large, but the extent to which such potentials
can be exploited over time is still poorly studied. Studies assume
the successful introduction of biomass production in key regions
as Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe and
Oceania, combined with gradual improvements in agricultural
practice and management (including livestock). However, such
development schemes — that could also generate substantial
additional income for rural regions that can export biomass

"The estimated high biomass demand consists of an
estimated maximum use of biomass for power production
and the constrained growth of production of biofuels when
the WEO projections are taken into consideration (25 EJ/yr
biofuels and about 40 EJ/yr primary biomass demand). Total
combined demand for biomass for power and fuels adds up to
about 130 EJ/yr. Clearly, a more substantial contribution from
energy crops (perhaps in part from degraded lands, for example
producing jatropha oil seeds) is required to cover total demand
of this magnitude, but this still seems feasible, even for 2030;
the low-end estimate for energy crops for agricultural land is
50 EJ/yr, which is in line with the 40 EJ/yr primary projected
demand for biofuels.

"at 70 EJ/yr). However, demand does not include estimates of
domestic biomass use (such as cooking fuel, although that use
may diminish over time depending on development pathways
in developing countries), increased biomass for production of
heat (although additional demand in this area may be limited)
and biomass use in industry (excluding the possible demand of
biomass for new biomaterials). It seems that this demand can
be met by biomass residues from forestry, agriculture, waste
and dung and a limited contribution from energy crops. Such
a ‘low biomass demand’ pathway may develop from the use
of agricultural crops with more limited potentials, lower GHG
mitigation impact and less attractive economic prospects, in
particular in temperate climate regions. The major exception
here is sugar-cane-based ethanol production.
"	Text
"However, as was also acknowledged in the WEO, the demand
for biomass as biofuels in around 2030 will depend in particular
on the commercialization of second-generation biofuel
technologies (i.e. the large-scale gasification of biomass for
the production of synfuels as Fischer-Tropsch diesel, methanol
or DME, and the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass for
the production of ethanol). According to Hamelinck and Faaij
(2006), such technologies offer competitive biofuel production
compared to oil priced at between 40-50 US$/barrel (assuming
biomass prices of around 2 US$/GJ). In Chapter 5, Figure 5.9
(IEA, 2006b), however, assumes higher biofuel costs. Another
key option is the wider deployment of sugar cane for ethanol
production, especially on a larger scale using state-of-the art
mills, and possibly in combination with hydrolysis technology
and additional ethanol production from bagasse (as argued
by Moreira, 2006 and other authors). The availability of such
technologies before 2020 may lead to an acceleration of biofuel
production and use, even before 2030. Biofuels may therefore
become the most important demand factor for biomass,
especially in the longer term (i.e. beyond 2030).

these sectors, the special IPCC report on ozone and climate
(IPCC & TEAP, 2005) reported a mitigation potential
for HFCs of 0.44 GtCO,-eq for the year 2015 (a mitigation
potential of 0.46 GtCO,-eq was reported for CFCs and

"Given the lack of studies of how biomass resources may
be distributed over various demand sectors, we do not suggest
any allocation of the different biomass supplies to various
applications. Furthermore, the net avoidance costs per ton of
CO, of biomass usage depend on a wide variety of factors,
including the biomass resource and supply (logistics) costs,
conversion costs (which in turn depend on the availability of
improved or advanced technologies) and reference fossil fuel
prices, most notably of oil.

"Given the relatively small number of relevant scenario
studies available to date, it is fair to say that the role of biomass
in long-term stabilization (beyond 2030) will be very significant
but that it is subject to relatively large uncertainties. Further
research is required to improve our insight into the potential.
A number of key factors influencing biomass mitigation
potential are worth noting: the baseline economic growth and
energy supply alternatives, assumptions about technological
change (such as the rate of development of cellulosic ethanol
conversion technology), land use competition, and mitigation
alternatives (overall and land-related).

"Table 11.3 uses the procedures outlined above to bring
together the estimates for the economic potentials for GHG
mitigation from Chapters 4 to 10. It was not possible to break
down the potential into the desired cost categories for all
sectors. Where appropriate, then, the cells in the table have
been merged to account for the fact that the numbers represent
the total of two cost categories. Only the potentials in the cost
categories up to 100 US$/tCO,-eq are reported here. Some of
the chapters also report numbers for the potential in higher
cost categories. This is the case for Chapter 5 (transport) and
Chapter 8 (agriculture).

"Table 11.3 suggests that the economic potential for reducing
GHG emissions at costs below 100 US$/tCO, ranges’ from 16
to 30 GtCO,-eq. The contributions of each sector to the totals
are in the order of magnitude 2 to 6 GtCO,-eq (mid-range
numbers), except for the waste sector (0.4 to 1 GtCO,-eq). The
mitigation potentials at the lowest cost are estimated for the
buildings sector. Based on the literature assessment presented
in Chapter 6 it can be concluded that over 80% of the buildings
potential can be identified at negative cost. However, significant
barriers need to be overcome to achieve these potentials. See
Chapter 6 for more information on these barriers.

"Comparing mitigation estimates for top-down and bottom-
up modelling is not straightforward. Bottom-up mitigation
responses are typically more detailed and derived from more
constrained modelling exercises. Cost estimates are therefore
in partial equilibrium in that input and output market prices are
fixed, as may be key input quantities such as acreage or capital.
Top-down mitigation responses consider more generic mitigation
technologies and changes in outputs and inputs (such as shifts
from food crops or forests to energy crops) as well as changes
in market prices (such as land prices as competition for land
increases). In addition, current top-down models optimistically
assume the simultaneous global adoption of a coordinated
climate policy with an unconstrained, or almost unconstrained,
set of mitigation options across sectors. A review of top-down
studies (Chapter 3 data assembled from Rose et al. (2007) and
US CCSP (2006)) results in a range for total projected biomass
use over all cost categories of 20 to 79 EJ/yr (defined as solid
and liquid, requiring a conversion ratio from primary biomass to
fuels). This is, on average, half the range for estimates obtained
via bottom-up information from the various chapters.

Discount rates that formed the basis of the analysis are — as
reported in the individual chapters — in the range of 3 to
10%, with the majority of studies using the lower end of this
range. Lower discount rates (e.g. 2%) would imply some
shift to lower cost ranges, without substantially affecting the
total potential. Moving to higher discount rates would have
a particular impact on the potential in the highest cost range,
which makes up 15 to 20% of the total potential.
Agriculture and forestry potential estimates are based on long-
term experimental results under current climate conditions.
Given moderate deviations in the climate expected by 2030,
the mitigation estimates are considered quite robust.

"In general, higher energy prices will have some impact on
the mitigation potentials presented here (i.e. those with costs
below 100 US$/tCO,-eq), but the impact is expected to be
generally limited, except for the transport sector (see below).
No major options have been identified exceeding 100 US$/
tCO,-eq that could move to below 100 US$/tCO,-eq. However,
this is only true of the fairly static approach presented here. The
costs and potential of technologies in 2030 may be different if
energy prices remain high for several decades compared to the
situation if they return to the levels of the 1990s. High energy
prices may also impact the baseline since the fuel mix will
change and lower emissions can be expected. Note that options
in some areas, such as agriculture and forestry and non-CO,
greenhouse gases (about one third of the potential reported), are
not affected by energy prices, or much less so.

"The potential for combined generation of heat and power in
the energy supply sector has not added to the other potentials
as it is uncertain (see Section 4.4.3). IEA (2006a) quotes a
potential here of 0.2 to 0.4 GtCO,-eq.

The potential emissions reduction for coal mining and gas
pipelines has not been included in the reductions from the
power sector. De Jager et al. (2001) indicated that the CH,
emissions from coal mining in 2020 might be in the order of
0.65 GtCO,-eq. Reductions of 70 to 90% with a penetration
level of 40% might be possible, resulting for 2020 in the
order of 0.20 GtCO,-eq. Higher reduction potentials of
0.47 GtCO,-eq for CH, from coal mining have also been
mentioned (Delhotal et a/., 2006).

Emission reductions in freight transport (heavy duty
vehicles), public transport, and marine transport have not
been included. In the transport sector, only the mitigation
potential for light duty vehicle efficiency improvement
(LDV), air planes and biofuels for road transport has been
assessed. Because LDV represents roughly two-thirds of
transportation by road, and because road transportation
represents roughly three-quarters of transport as a whole
(air, water, and rail transport represent roughly 11, 9 and 3
percent of overall transport respectively), the estimate for
LDV broadly reflects half of the transport activity for which
a mitigation potential of over 0.70 GtCO,-eq is reported. In
the case of marine transport, the literature studies discussed
in Section 5.3.4 indicate that large reductions are possible
compared to the current standard but this might not be
significant when comparing to a baseline. See also Table 5.8
for indicative potentials for some of the options.
Non-technical options in the transport sector, like speed limits
and changes in modal split or behaviour changes, are not
taken into account (an indication of the order of magnitude
for Latin American cities is given in Table 5.6).

For the buildings sector, most literature sources focused on
low-cost mitigation options and so high-cost options are
less well represented. Behavioural changes in the buildings
sector have not been included; some of these raise energy
demand, examples being rebound effects from improvements
in energy efficiency.?

In the industry sector, the fuel savings have only been
estimated for the energy-intensive sectors representing
approximately 50% of fuel use in manufacturing industry.
The TAR stated an emission reduction estimate of 2.20
GtCO,-eq in 2020 for material efficiency. Chapter 7 does
not include material efficiency, except for recycling for
selected industries, in the estimate of the industrial emission
reduction potential. To avoid double counting, the TAR
estimate should not be added to the potentials of Chapter 7.
However, it is likely that the potential for material efficiency

It is not the case that bottom-up approaches systematically

largely from lower costs in the top-down models, because some
have introduced multi-gas abatement and have introduced more
bottom-up features, such as induced technological change,
which also tend to reduce costs.

"The economic potential up to 100 US$/tCO,_eq is about 30 to
50% of emissions in 2030. There is medium evidence for these
conclusions because, although a significant amount of literature
is available, there are gaps and regional biases, and baselines are
different. There is also medium agreement on these conclusions
because there is literature for each sector with substantial ranges
but the ranges may not capture all the uncertainties that exist.
Although there are differences in relative mitigation potentials
and specific mitigation costs between sectors (e.g. the buildings
sector has a large share of low-cost options), it is clear that the
total mitigation potential is spread across the various sectors.
Substantial emission reductions can only be achieved if most
of the sectors contribute to the emission reduction. In addition,
there are barriers that need to be overcome if these potentials
are to materialize.

and (2) upstream, at the point of emission to the energy supply

"of bottom-up and top-down results:

1) Sector definitions differ between top-down and bottom-up
approaches. The sectoral data presented here are not fully
comparable. The main difference is that the electricity
savings are allocated to the power sector in the top-down
models compared to the end-use sectors in Table 11.3. Both
allocation approaches are presented in Table 11.5.

2) At a sector level however, there are some systematic and

striking discrepancies:
Energy supply. The top-down models indicate a higher
emission reduction. This can be explained in part by
differences in the mitigation options that are included
in the top-down models and not included in the bottom-
up approach. Examples are: reductions in extraction and
distribution, reductions of other non-CO, emissions, and
reductions through the increased use of CHP. Further,
different estimates of the inertia of the substitution are
expected to play a role. In bottom-up estimates, fuel
substitution is assumed only after end-use savings whereas
top-down models adopt a more continuous approach.
Finally, the top-down estimates include the effects of energy
savings in other sectors and structural changes. For example,
a reduction in oil use also implies a reduction in emissions
from refineries. These effects are excluded from the bottom-
WN ectimates

"Various estimates of cross-sectoral mitigation potential
for specific regions have been published, usually as reports
commissioned by governments. Unfortunately, however, the
issue of attributing costs to cross-sectoral effects of greenhouse
gas mitigation policies has not been reported extensively since
the TAR, and literature on this topic is consequently sparse.

"This section looks at literature dealing specifically with the
modelling of interactions between energy supply and demand.
It first considers the carbon content of electricity, a crucial
feature of the cross-sectoral aggregation of potentials discussed
above, and then the effect of mitigation on energy prices. The
studies emphasize the dependence of mitigation potentials from
end-use electricity savings on the generation mix.

"As discussed above, there are many interactions between
CO, mitigation measures in the demand and supply of energy.
Particularly in the case of electricity, consumers are unaware of
the types and volumes of primary energy required for generating
electricity. The electricity producer determines the power
generation mix, which depends on the load characteristics. The
CO, mitigation measures not only affect the generation mix
(supply side) through the load characteristics. They are also
influenced by the price.

"IGCC, the installation of CHP reduces CO, emission in the total
system. However, in a different scenario, the CO, reduction
effect of CHP introduction may be substantially lower. For
example, the effect is negligible when highly efficient CCGTs
(combined cycle gas turbines) are dominant at baseline and
replaced by CHP. Furthermore, in the albeit unlikely case of
nuclear power being competitive at baseline but replaced by
CHP, the total CO, emission from the energy system increases
with CHP installation. These results suggest that the CO,
reduction potential associated with the introduction of CHP
should be evaluated with caution.

"Price responses to energy demand can be much larger
when energy prices are rising than when they are falling, but
responses in conventional modelling are symmetric. The
mitigation response to policy may therefore be much larger
when energy prices are rising. This phenomenon is addressed in
literature about asymmetrical price responses and the effects of
technological change (Gately and Huntington, 2002; Griffin and
Shulman, 2005). Bashmakov (2006) also argues forasymmetrical
responses in the analysis of what is called the economics of
constants and variables: the existence of very stable energy
costs to income proportions, which can be observed over the
longer period of statistical observations in many countries. He
argues that there are thresholds for total energy costs such as a
ratio of GDP or gross output, and energy costs by transportation
and residential sector as shares of personal income. If rising
energy prices push the ratios towards the given thresholds, then
the dynamics of energy-demand price responses are changed.
The effect on real income can become sufficient to reduce GDP
growth, mobility and the level of indoor comfort. Carbon taxes
and permits become more effective the closer the ratio is to the
threshold, so the same rates and prices generate different results
depending on the relationship of the energy costs to income or
of the gross output ratio to the threshold.

"Iwafune ef al. (2001a; 2001b; 2001c), and Kraines et al.
(2001) discuss the effects of the interactions between electricity
supply and demand sectors in the Virtual Tokyo model.
Demand-side options and supply-side options are considered
simultaneously, with changes in the optimal mix in power
generation reflecting changes in the load profile caused by the
introductions of demand-side options such as the enhanced
insulation of buildings and installation of photovoltaic (PV)
modules on rooftops. The economic indicators used for demand-
side behaviours are investment pay-back time and marginal CO,
abatement cost. Typical results of lwafune et a/. (2001a) are that
the introduction of demand-side measures reduces electricity
demand in Tokyo by 3.5%, reducing CO, emissions from power
supply by 7.6%. The CO, emission intensity of the reduced
electricity demand is more than two times higher than the
average CO, intensity of electricity supply because reductions
in electricity demands caused by the saving of building energy
demand and/or the installation of PV modules occur mainly in
daytime when more carbon-intensive fuels are used. A similar
‘wedge’ — in this case between the average carbon intensity of
electricity supply and the carbon value of electricity savings
—was found, in the UK system, to depend upon the price of EU
ETS allowances, with high ETS prices increasing the carbon
value of end-use savings by around 40% as coal is pushed to the
margin of power generation (Grubb and Wilde, 2005).

"The effects of different policy mixes on sectoral outcomes
are shown in the US EIA (2005) analysis of the National
Commission on Energy Policy’s (NCEP) 2004 proposals. These
involve reductions in the US emissions in GHGs of about 11%
by 2025 below a reference case, including an analysis of the
cap-and-trade component, (involving a safety valve limiting the
maximum cost of emissions permits to US$ (2003)8.50/tCO,
through to 2025) and a no-safety-valve case (in which the cost
rises to US$(2003) 35/tCO, and the GHG reduction to 15%
by 2025). The effects on CO, emissions by broad sector are
shown in Figure 11.4. Note that the NCEP scenario includes the
cap-and-trade scheme (with a safety valve) shown separately
in the figure and that the no-safety-valve scenario is additional
to the NCEP scenario. The NCEP scenario includes substantial
energy efficiency policies for transportation and buildings. This
explains the relatively large contributions of these sectors in
this scenario. The cap-and-trade schemes mainly affect the
electricity sector, since the price of coal-fired generation rises
relative to other generation technologies. For discussion of

"One major cross-sectoral study (EU DG Environment, 2001)
brings together low-cost mitigation options and shows their
effects across sectors and regions. It shows how a Kyoto-style
target (8% reduction of EU GHGs below 1990/95 by 2010)
can be achieved for the EU-15 member states with options
costing less than 20 US$/tCO,. The study assesses the direct
and indirect outcomes using a top-down model (PRIMES) for
energy-related CO, and a bottom-up model (GENESIS) for all
other GHGs. The synthesis of the results is presented in Table
11.7. This multi-gas study considers all GHGs, but assumes
that the JI and CDM flexibility instruments are not used. The
study shows the wide variations in cost-effective mitigation
across sectors. The largest reductions compared to the 1990/95
baselines are in the energy and energy-intensive sectors,
whereas there is an increase of 25% in the transport sector
compared to 1990/95 emissions. Note also the large reductions
in methane and N,O in the achievement of the overall target as
shown in the lower panel of the table. The results are, however,
dominated by bottom-up energy-engineering assumptions since
PRIMES is a partial-equilibrium model. Consequently, the GDP
effects of the options are not provided. These potentials can be
compared to those at less than 20 US$/tCO, in Table 11.3 above
for the sectoral synthesis for the OECD. The EU potentials are
similarly concentrated in the buildings sector, but with a larger
share for industry, and a lower one for transport, reflecting the
high existing taxes on transport fuels in the EU.

The limited use of CDM and JI to meet the allocations
would result in a negative effect on welfare of close to 1%
in 2012 relative to ‘business as usual’; this assumes that EU
Member States do not import more than 50% of their required
reductions and that they do not import ‘hot air’. Unrestricted
trading in CDM and JI credits and allowances would result
in an allocation where the Kyoto target can be met with hardly
any welfare costs.

"Most analyses discussed in the TAR focused on national
emission policies under the Kyoto Protocol in the form of
an economy-wide tax or tradeable permit system. This has
continued to be an active area of policy modelling since the
Kyoto Protocol came into force. Global cost studies of the
Kyoto Protocol since the TAR have considered more detailed
implementation questions and their likely impact on overall
cost. Chief among these have been the impact of the Bonn-
Marrakesh agreements concerning sink budgets, the non-
participation of the United States, and banking and the use of
‘hot air’ (Manne and Richels, 2001; Bohringer, 2002; den Elzen

"The TAR reviewed studies of climate policy interactions with
the existing tax system. These interactions change the aggregate
impact of a climate policy by changing the costs associated with
taxes in other markets. They also point to the opportunity for
climate policy — through carbon taxes or auctioned permits — to
generate government revenue and, in turn, to reduce other taxes
and their associated burden. The TAR pointed to this opportunity
as a way to reduce climate policy costs. Since the TAR, additional
studies have extended the debate (Bach et al., 2002; Roson,
2003). Meanwhile, such arguments have been the basis of the UK
Climate Change Levy and linked reduction in National Insurance
Contributions, small auctions under the EU ETS and US NO,
Budget Program, large proposed auctions under the Regional
Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the United States, and proposals in
the United States, Japan, and New Zealand for carbon taxes.

"The main conclusions from the TAR on the macro-economic
costs of mitigation can be summarized as follows. Mitigation
costs can be substantially reduced through a portfolio of policy
instruments, including those that help to overcome barriers, with
emissions trading in particular expected to reduce the costs.
However, mitigation costs may be significant for particular
sectors and countries over some periods and the costs tend to
rise with more stringent levels of atmospheric stabilization.
Unplanned and unexpected policies with sudden short-term
effects may cost much more for the same eventual results than
planned and expected policies with gradual effects. Near-term
anticipatory action in mitigation and adaptation would reduce
risks and provide benefits because of the inertia in climate,
ecological and socio-economic systems. The effectiveness of
adaptation and mitigation is increased and costs are reduced if
they are integrated with policies for sustainable development.

"U.S. non-participation in the Kyoto Protocol, coupled with
the increase in sink budgets in Bonn and Marrakech, implies
that the target for Annex B countries as a whole will likely be
met with virtually no effort. In other words, excess allowances
in Russian and Ukraine (referred to as ‘hot air’) roughly equal
the shortfall in Europe, Japan, Canada, and other countries.
However, some of these same studies emphasize that strategic
behaviour by Russia and Ukraine, acting as a supply cartel
and/or choosing to bank allowances until the next commitment
period, will lead to a positive emission price (Léschel and Zhang,
2002; Bohringer and Léschel, 2003; Maeda, 2003; Klepper
and Peterson, 2005). For example, Bohringer and Léschel
(2003) use a large-scale static CGE model of the world
economy to analyse the costs of Kyoto in different scenarios with
and without Annex B emissions trading and U.S. participation.
GDP costs of Kyoto for 2010 without US participation, with
Annex B trading, but without use of ‘hot air’ are estimated at
0.03% for Annex B (without US) for a carbon price of 13 US$/
tCO,, with a 6.6% reduction in total Annex-B CO). Regional
GDP costs are 0.05% for the EU15 and Japan, and 0.1% for
Canada, with benefits of 0.2% for the European Economies in
Transition and 0.4% for Russia and other countries in Eastern
Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia. Without Annex B
trading, the costs are estimated at 0.08% for Annex B (without
US).

down, bottom-up model that contains a detailed representation
of energy technologies, energy demand, and primary energy
supply, coupled with an aggregate model of economic activity
(Holte and Kydes, 1997; Kydes, 2000; Gabriel et al., 2001).
While the estimates were conducted over a period of seven
years, with changes occurring in the baseline, the model
produces a remarkably consistent set of estimates, with most
physical quantities (including emission reductions) varying
more or less linearly with carbon price, and potential absolute
GDP impacts varying with the price squared. Real GDP impacts,
which include business cycle effects, are less consistent and
depend on both policy timing and assumptions about revenue
recycling. For example, the real GDP loss of 0.64% shown
for ‘Kyoto+9%’ is reduced to 0.3% by 2020 when recycling
benefits are taken into account (EIA, 1998).

Baseline emissions: LOW reflects the B1 scenario and HIGH the A1F sce-
nario (IMAGE team, 2001). Our reference is the A1B scenario.

Hot Air Banking: the LOW case reflects no banking of hot air, with all hot air
being banked in the HIGH case; the reference case is one in which hot air
banking is optimal for the Annex-! FSU.

Marginal Abatement Cost (MAC) curves: the MAC curves of WorldScan

are used in the reference case while the MAC curves of the POLES model
represent the HIGH case.

Participation Annex |: at the LOW end, we examined the participation of
Kazakhstan while the HIGH end reflects US re-entry.

Sinks: a LOW case has been constructed by assuming that CDM sink
credits are capped to 0.5 percent of base year emissions (instead of 1
percent), carbon credits from forest management based on data submitted
by the Parties (which are lower than the reported values in Appendix Z, see
(Pronk, 2001) and low estimates for carbon credits from agricultural and
grassland management using the ALTERRA ACSD model (Nabuurs et al.,
2000). The HIGH case reflects sinks credits based on high ACSD estimates
for agricultural and grassland management and maximum carbon credits
from forest management as reported in Appendix Z. In total, the LOW case
implies 70 MtC while the HIGH case implies 195 MtC of carbon credits from
sink-related activities. The Marrakesh Accords represent the reference case
of 120 MtC.

CDM Accessibility Factor: this reflects the operational availability of viable
CDM projects and is set at 10 percent of the theoretical maximum in the
reference case. In the LOW case, we assume no accessibility, while in the
HIGH case the factor is set at 30 percent.

Transaction Costs: the transaction costs associated with the use of the
Kyoto Mechanisms are set at 20 percent in the reference case, 10 percent
in the LOW case and 30 percent in the HIGH case.

"Both Fischer and Morgenstern (2006) and Lasky (2003)
identify treatment of international trade and the disaggregation
of the energy sector as important factors leading to differences
in the cost of Kyoto for the US economy. Lasky also identifies
energy-demand elasticities and sensitivities to higher inflation
as important factors. He concludes that the cost of the US joining
Kyoto under Annex I permit trading is between -0.5 to -1.2% of
GDP by 2010, with a standardized energy-price sensitivity, and
including non-CO, gases and sinks, but excluding recycling
benefits and any ancillary benefits from improved air quality.
The cost falls to 0.2% of GDP with global trading of permits.
Barker and Ekins (2004) review the large number of modelling
studies dealing with the costs of Kyoto for the US economy that
were available when the US administration decided to withdraw
from the process. These include the World Resources Institute’s
meta-analysis (Repetto and Austin, 1997), the EMF-16 studies
(Weyant and Hill, 1999) and the US Administration’s own study
discussed above (EIA, 1998). The review confirms Lasky’s
range of costs but offsets these with benefits from recycling
the revenues from permit auctioning and the environmental
benefits of lower air pollution. These co-benefits of mitigation
are discussed in Section 11.8 below.

roughly one-quarter to one-third of the GDP costs reported
in the EIA analyses. This is partly explained by the fact that
the EIA uses an econometric model to compute GDP costs
derived from historic experience in the face of energy price
shocks. The MIT and other CGE models assume that, to a large
extent, aggregate costs equal the accumulated marginal costs of
abatement, typically yielding lower costs than the econometric
models (Repetto and Austin, 1997; EIA, 2003).

They note that, while these costs are in line with similar studies
of reduction costs in the United States conducted by EIA, they
are considerably higher than alternative results for Canada
derived from a bottom-up model, and they predict a roughly
33 US$/tCO,-eq allowance price. The authors then show how,
by making what they consider longer-run assumptions — lower

country’s carbon price. When a rise in price comes on top of an
already distorted fuel price, this results in an additional negative
effect on welfare, which might outweigh the gains from sales
of permits. It is a negative price effect and a positive income
effect. This study finds that some countries, like Scandinavian
countries or Spain (mainly importers of carbon permits), would
be better off with international trading. Others, like the United

worse off with trading than without.

outlier, and a mean of 31 US$/tCO, (just over 110 US$/tC). The
other Category III models nearly all give higher prices.

In most models (24 of the 25 scenarios!) the ‘optimal’ trajectory
towards stabilization at 4.5W/m? (EMF21 studies), or the near-
equivalent 550 ppm CO,-only (IMCP and EMF19), requires
abatement at less than 20% CO, compared to baseline by 2030,
with correspondingly low-carbon prices (mostly below 20
US$/tCO,-eq, all prices in 2000 US$). Costs are less than 0.7%
global GDP, consistent with the median of 0.2% and the 10-90
percentile range —0.6 to 1.2% for the full set of scenarios given
in Chapter 3 (see Figure 3.14). Carbon prices in the EMF21
multigas studies for 4.5W/m2 by 2030 average 18 US$/tCO-eq,

11 These include three scenarios in the U.S. Climate Change Science Program (US CCSP, 2006). Note that the cost assessment presented here is based on a smaller set of scenarios
than the assessment in Chapter 3. While Chapter 3 uses the full set of scenarios, including the post-SRES of the TAR, the assessment here relies on post-TAR studies that report in-
formation for macro-economic costs. In other words, modelling studies that do not give integrated GDP results are excluded from Figure 11.7 and the associated discussion in this
chapter. While Chapter 3 focuses primarily on the assessment of representative cost ranges covering a larger sample, this chapter focuses on the comparative analysis of different
post-TAR studies exploring the relationship between the cost indicators and their determinants in the models.

12 The excluded scenario is also an outlier in that FUND is the only EMF21 model to show a declining path for carbon prices, which fall to near zero by 2100 (Weyant et al, 2006, p. 25).

13 These scenarios exclude post-SRES results, which did not report carbon prices; see footnote 11. The Category III outlier scenario comes from the CCSP-IGSM model. The price
rises to 1651 US$/tCO2 by 2100. This high price is partly due to the assumption of the limited substitution of fossil fuels by electricity as an energy source for transportation:

‘In the IGSM scenarios, fuel demand for transportation, where electricity is not an option and for which biofuels supply is insufficient, continues to be a substantial source of
emissions.’ (US CCSP, 2006, p. 4-21).

"Since the TAR, groups of modellers have found a reduction
in expected macro-economic costs as a result of the use of
multigas options (EMF21, Weyant et al., 2006) (see Section
3.3.5.4) and because carbon prices affect technological change
in the models (EMF19, IMCP) (see Section 11.5). Figure 11.7
summarizes the 2030 data brought together in these studies as
well in as other post-TAR Category III (stabilization at around
550ppm CO,-eq) studies covered in Chapter 3.!! The figure is
in 3 parts, showing (a) the carbon prices in US$(2000) by 2030
(typically a rising trend) and their effects on CO, emissions, (b)
the effects of CO, abatement on GDP, and (c) the relationship
between carbon prices and gross world output (GDP). All data
are differences from the baseline projections for 2030. The
studies are grouped around two of the stabilization categories
set out in Chapter 3 (Table 3.5), with corresponding insights.

Notes: Figure 11.7 shows, for 2030, the carbon price, CO, abatement relative to the baseline, and global GDP differences from baseline for five different sets of
stabilization studies: EMF21 radiative forcing at 4.5 W/m? (multigas); IMCP at 550 and 450ppm (CO,-only with induced technological change); EMF19 at 550ppm (CO,-
only with induced technological change) and 6 studies in category III included in Figure 3.24. The results as shown exclude incomplete sets (i.e. data have to be available
for all three variables shown). The EMF21 results exclude studies unsuitable for near-term analysis (e.g. substantial effects for a past year). The IMCP results exclude
those from two experimental/partial studies. The breakdown into Category Ill and IV scenarios treats CO,-only studies as if they also allow for cost-effective non-CO,
multigas GHG mitigation (see Table 3.14). Note that prices and outputs are based on various definitions, so the figures are indicative only. The price bases in the original
studies vary and have been converted to 2000 US$.

14 E3MG (Barker et al., 2006b) takes a Post Keynesian approach, allowing under-used resources in the global economy to be taken up for the extra low-carbon investment induced by
climate policies when permit/tax revenues are recycled by reducing indirect taxes. Such a response to revenue recyling is a feature of regional studies reported in the TAR (p. 518).
FEEM-RICE (Bosetti et al., 2006) allows international cooperation in climate policies to increase the productivity of R&D investment. ENTICE-BR (Popp, 2006a), in a scenario which
assumes a high elasticity of substitution between backstop and fossil fuels, shows increasing global output above baseline with more stringent stabilization targets (p. 173).

suggest that the 20-50 US$/tCO, cost category of the sector

Lasky, 2003; Weyant, 2003; Barker et al., 2006a; Fischer and
Morgenstern, 2006). Weyant (2001) argues that the five major
determinants of costs are: projections for base case GHG
emissions; climate policy (flexibility, for example); substitution
possibilities for producers and consumers; the rate and process
of technological change; and the characterization of mitigation
benefits. Turning to the base case, he notes the importance of
assumptions about population and economic activity, resource
availability and prices, and technology availability and costs.

at 550 ppm CO,-eq (category III of Table 3.10) (longer-term
strategies are discussed in Chapter 3; discussions of policy
mechanisms are covered in Chapter 13). For example, Den
Elzen et al. (2005), using the IMAGE-FAIR modelling system,
show that different assumptions about business-as-usual
emission levels and abatement cost curves lead to a range of
marginal costs of between 50 US$ and 200 US$/tCO,-eq and of
total direct abatement costs of between 0.4 and 1.4% of world
GDP in 2050, consistent with a recent EU report (EEA, 2006).

with higher loss of GDP. The relationships vary, and two
models in particular stand out as radically different from others
(E3MG and FUND). Three models in the IMCP predict GDP
gains under different assumptions.!4 These prices and costs are
largely determined by the approaches and assumptions adopted
by the modellers, with GDP outcomes being strongly affected
by assumptions about technology costs and change processes
(see 11.5 below), the use of revenues from permits and taxes

"In summary, various post-2012 Kyoto studies have been
completed since the TAR. Nearly all those focusing on 550
and 650 ppm COQ,-eq stabilization targets (Categories B and
C, Table 3.10) with a 540% reduction in global CO, below
baseline by 2030, find total costs of about 1% or lower of global
GDP by 2030. The critical assumption in these studies is global
emissions trading, but there is limited consideration of multi-
gas stabilization and endogenous technological change across
the studies, and no co-benefits. The few studies with baselines
that require higher CO, reductions to achieve the targets require
higher carbon prices and report higher GDP costs. As noted in
Sections 11.5 (induced technological change), 3.3.5.4 (multi-
gas approaches), and 11.8.1 (co-benefits), these considerations
all tend to lower costs or provide non-climate benefits, perhaps
substantially.

"Bollen et al. (2004), using Worldscan (a global CGE
model), consider the consequences of post-Kyoto policies
seeking a 30% reduction for Annex B countries below 1990
levels by 2020. They do not include the CDM, sinks or induced
technological change in the modelling. Like most studies, they
find dramatically lower costs when global trading occurs. With
only Annex | countries participating in emissions trading, the
high-growth benchmark case shows an allowance price of about
130 US$(2000)/tCO,, and a 2.2% reduction below baseline for
Annex I GDP. With global trading, the allowance price is about
17 US$(2000)/tCO, and there is a much lower loss of 0.6% in
GDP. In a more modest scenario that focuses exclusively on
maintaining the current Kyoto targets for all Annex B countries,
Russ, Ciscar, and Szabo (2005) estimate a 7 US$(2000)/tCO,
price and a 0.02—0.05% GDP loss in 2025 with global trading
(using the POLES and GEM-E3 models).

"The Stern Review (2006), which was commissioned by
the UK Treasury, also considers a range of modelling results.
Drawing on estimates from two studies, it reports the costs
of an emissions trajectory leading to stabilization at around
500-550ppm CO,-eq. One of the two studies (Anderson,
2006) calculates estimates of annual abatement costs (i.e. not
the macro-economic costs) of 0.3% of GDP for 2015, 0.7%
for 2025 and 1% for 2050 from an engineering analysis based
on several underlying reports of future technology costs. His
uncertainty analysis, exploring baseline uncertainties about
technology costs and fuel prices, shows a 95% prediction
range of costs from —0.5% to +4% of GDP for 2050. The other
study is a meta-analysis by Barker et al. (2006a) and looks
at the macro-economic costs in terms of GDP effects. The
study aims to explain the different estimates of costs for given
reductions in global CO, in terms of the model characteristics
and policy assumptions adopted in the studies. With favourable
assumptions about international flexibility mechanisms, the
responsiveness and cost of low-carbon technological change,
and tax reform recycling revenues to reduce burdensome taxes,
costs are lowered, and in some cases become negative (i.e. GDP
is higher than baseline).

use of CGE models), and whether technological change is
assumed to respond to carbon prices, the topic of the next

"A major development since the TAR has been the treatment
of technological change in many models as endogenous — and
therefore potentially induced by climate policy — compared to
previous assumptions of exogenous technological change that
is unaffected by climate policies (see glossary for definitions).
This section discusses the effect of the new endogenous
approach on emission permit prices, carbon tax rates, GDP and/
or economic welfare, and policy modelling (Chapter 2, Section
2.7.1 discusses the concepts and definitions, and Chapter 13
provides a broader discussion of mitigation and technology

"The crucial finding of these meta-analyses is that most of the
differences between models are accounted for by the modellers’
assumptions. For example, the strongest factor leading to
lower carbon prices is the assumption of high substitutability
between internationally-traded products. Other factors leading
to lower prices include the greater disaggregation of product
and regional markets. This suggests that any particular set of
results about costs may well be the outcome of the particular
assumptions and characterization of the problem chosen by the
model builder, and these results may not be replicated by others
choosing different assumptions.
"	Text
"The TAR reported that most models make exogenous
assumptions about technological change (9.4.2.3) and that there
continues to be active debate about whether the rate of aggregate
technological change will respond to climate policies (7.3.4.1).
The TAR also reported that endogenizing technological change
could shift the optimal timing of mitigation forward or backward
(8.4.5). The direction depends on whether technological change
is driven by R&D investments (suggesting less mitigation
now and more mitigation later, when costs decline) or by
accumulation of experience induced by the policies (suggesting
an acceleration in mitigation to gain that experience, and lower
costs, earlier). Overall, the TAR noted that differences in
exogenous technology assumptions were a central determinate
of differences in estimated mitigation costs and other impacts.
"	Text
"The factors accounting for differences between cost
estimates can be divided into three groups: features inherent
in the economies being studied (for example, high substitution
possibilities at low cost), assumptions about policy (such as
the use of international trading in emission permits, or the
recycling of auction revenues), and simplifying assumptions
chosen by the model builders to represent the economy (how
many sector or regions are included in the model). The first
two sets of factors can be controlled by specifying the countries
and time-scales of the mitigation action, and the exact details of
the policies, as in the EMF-16 studies. However, differences in
modellers’ approaches and assumptions persist in the treatment
of substitution and technology. The various factors can be
disentangled by a meta-analysis of published finding (this may
include an analysis of analyses). This technique was first used
in this context by Repetto and Austin (1997) in a mitigation-
cost analysis of GDP costs for the US economy. Fischer and
Morgenstern (2006) conduct a similar meta-analysis dealing
with the carbon prices (taken to be the marginal abatement costs)
of achieving Kyoto targets reported by the EMF-16 studies and
discussed in the TAR (Weyant and Hill, 1999).

be viewed as a critical determinant of GDP and welfare costs,

large numbers of modelling studies undertaken before 2000 and
regard the treatment of technology as influential in reducing
costs and carbon prices, but find that the cross-model results on
the issue are conflicting, uncertain and weak. Since the TAR,
there has been considerable focus on the role of technology,
especially in top-down and hybrid modelling, in estimating the
impact of mitigation policies. However, syntheses of this work
tend to reveal wide differences in the theoretical approaches,
and results that are strongly dependent on a wide range of

to calibrate the models because, until recently, there were
few empirical studies of innovation and environmental policy.
So although we are confident that mitigation costs will be lower

"In his review, Sijm (2004) distinguishes top-down models that
mostly focus on explicit R&D effects, and bottom-up models
that focus mostly on LBD effects. Among the top-down models,
which are described in Table 11.15, he finds considerable variation
in the effect of including Endogenous Technological Change
(ETC). While some models find a large reduction in mitigation
costs (e.g. Popp, 2006a), some find small impacts (e.g. Nordhaus,
2002). These differences can be attributed to:

"Modellers have pursued two broad approaches to
endogenizing technological change, usually independently of
each other: explicit modelling of R&D activities that contribute
to a knowledge stock and reduce costs, and the accumulation
of knowledge through learning-by-doing. Sijm (2004) and
Edenhofer et al. (2006b) provide detailed comparative
assessments of different implementations of both approaches
with a focus on mitigation costs when endogenous technology
effects are ‘switched on’. Their syntheses provide a useful
window for understanding the variation in results and how
policies might induce technological change.

"The first point is that the way low-carbon and high-carbon
energy are treated in the models —whether as complements or
substitutes — is critical is determining the flexibility of the model
to low-carbon innovation and costs of mitigation. Models that
do not allow high levels of substitution between low-carbon
and high-carbon energy (Goulder and Mathai, 2000; Nordhaus,
2002; Popp, 2006b) indicate that R&D has less impact than
those that do, e.g. by introducing a carbon-free backstop
technology (Gerlagh and Lise, 2005; Popp, 2006b). Similar
results are found more widely for LBD and R&D models: the
more substitution possibilities allowed in the models, the lower
the costs (Edenhofer et al., 2006a, p.104).

reduction in costs is more pronounced, and the higher it
is, the greater the reduction.

the degree of ‘crowding-out’ associated with energy
R&D expenditures. If new energy R&D is assumed to
be in addition to existing R&D, this will generate larger
reductions in mitigation than if new energy R&D is
assumed to lead to a reduction in R&D elsewhere.

the approach to spillover. In addition to justifying
higher rates of return from R&D, spillover implies that
the market outcome with too little investment could be
improved by policy intervention.

"Despite the wide range of results, they suggest some
overarching conclusions (Weyant, 2004). First, technological
development, however and under whatever policy it unfolds, is
a (if not the) critical factor determining the long-term costs and
benefits of mitigation. Second, there is no obvious silver bullet:
a variety of technologies may be important depending on local
circumstances in the future, and a portfolio of investments will
be necessary to achieve significant mitigation at lower costs.
Third, major technology shifts like carbon capture, advanced
nuclear, and hydrogen require a long transition as learning-by-
doing accumulates and markets expand so that they tend to play
a more significant role in the second half of the century. By
contrast, end-use efficiency may provide major opportunities in
the shorter term.
"	Text
"Popp (2006b), in turn, suggests on the basis of the empirical
evidence that half of the R&D spending on energy in the 1970s
and 1980s took place at the expense of other R&D. Something
between full and partial crowding-out appears more recently in
Gerlagh and Lise (2005). Goulder and Matthai (2000) provide
an example of the importance for cost reduction of parameters
describing returns from R&D and capacity for innovation.
They compare both R&D as new knowledge and learning-
by-doing (LBD), finding a 29% reduction in the marginal
costs with R&D by 2050 and 39% with LBD. As they note,
however, this reflects the calibration of their model to a 30%
cost saving based on Manne and Richels’ assumptions (1992).
The model results simply reflect the choice of calibrated
parameter values.
"	Text
"When providing evidence to support the second point — the
studies of induced R&D effects via the stock of knowledge
— Goulder and Schneider (1999), Goulder and Mathai (2000),
Nordhaus (2002), Buonanno et al. (2003) and Popp (2004)
differ considerably about the extent of crowding-out. In other
words, does R&D have an above-average rate of return and does
an increase in R&D to support the carbon-saving technologies
come from ordinary production activities (no crowding-out), or
equally valuable R&D in other areas (crowding-out)? Nordhaus
(2002) assumes complete crowding-out in which carbon-saving
R&D has a social rate of return that is four times the private
rate of return but, because it is assumed that it replaces other
equally valuable R&D activities, it costs four times as much
as conventional investment. At the other extreme, Buonanno et
al. (2003) consider spillovers that lead to similarly high social
rates of return, but without the higher opportunity costs. Not
surprisingly, Nordhaus finds very modest mitigation cost savings
and Buonanno ef al. find enormous savings. In general, induced
technological change in a general-equilibrium framework has
its own opportunity costs, which may reduce the potential for
cost reduction in CGE models substantially.

"early in the learning process, it becomes inevitable that their
adoption spreads and that they eventually take over as carbon
prices fall. Finally, the approach often assumes that diffusion
and accompanying R&D are cost-free, although the investments
required for the technologies with high learning rates may be
comparable with those that are replaced.
"	Text
"The modelling of LBD is beset with problems. Model
solutions become more complex because costs can fall
indefinitely, depending on the extent of the market. Avoidance
of multiple solutions typically requires the modeller to constrain
the penetration of new technologies, making one element of the
cost reduction effectively exogenous. Since many low-carbon
technologies are compared with mature energy technologies
"	Text
"The variations in the estimated effects of learning on costs
in bottom-up models are driven primarily by variations in the
assumed rate of learning (in other words, the extent of the
reduction in costs for each doubling of installed capacity).
Estimates of these rates vary, depending on whether they are
assumed or econometrically estimated, and whether they derive
from expert elicitation or historical studies. These learning rates
vary between four leading models by as much as a factor of two
for a given technology, as shown in Table 11.16.
"	Text
"In addition, the measurement of learning rates poses
econometric problems. It is difficult to separate the effects of
time trends, economies of scale and R&D from those of LBD
(Isoard and Soria, 2001) and different functional forms and data
periods yield different estimates, so the learning rates may be
more uncertain than suggested by their treatment in the models.
When controls for the effects of other variables are included,
such as crowding-out effects, the influence of LBD in some
models may become very small compared to the effect of R&D
(K6hler et al., 2006; Popp, 2006c).
"	Text
"A second survey of ETC effects on aggregate mitigation
costs comes from the Innovation Modelling Comparison Project
(IMCP) (Edenhofer et a/., 2006b). Rather than reviewing
previous results, the IMCP engaged modelling teams to report
results for specific concentration scenarios and, in particular,
with and without ETC. Like the van Vuuren et al. (2004) study
noted earlier, the IMCP creates a baseline technology path
with ETC but without an explicit climate policy. This baseline
technology path can then be either fixed, as autonomous
technological change, or allowed to change in response to the
climate policy.
"	Text
"By contrast with the results for top-down models, Sijm
(2004) finds considerably more consistency among bottom-
up models, where the effects of learning-by-doing typically
reduce costs by 20% to 40% over the next half century, and
by 60% to 80% over the next century. Importantly, however,
these numbers are relative to a static technology alternative. To
demonstrate the influence of this assumption, van Vuuren et al.
(2004) run their model without a carbon constraint, but with
learning, to identify a baseline level of technological change.
Their approach roughly halves the estimated effect of ETC on
mitigation.
"	Text
"¢ Learning rates are defined as the percentage reduction in unit cost associated with a doubling of output. The acronym LDR stands for Learning-by-Doing Rates and
LSR for Learning-by-Searching Rates in two-factor learning curves. In two-factor learning curves, cumulative capacity and cumulative R&D (or ‘knowledge stock’) are
used to represent market experience (learning-by-doing) and knowledge accumulated through R&D activities, respectively.

¢ In MERGE-ETL, endogenous technological progress is applied to 8 energy technologies: six power plants (integrated coal gasification with combined cycle, gas,
turbine with combined cycle, gas fuel cell, new nuclear designs, wind turbine and solar photovoltaic) and two plants producing hydrogen (from biomass and solar
photovoltaic). Furthermore, compared to the original MERGE model, Bahn and Kypreos (2002; 2003a) have introduced two new power plants (using coal and gas) with
CO2 capture and disposal in depleted oil and gas reservoirs. Like the MARKAL model, the ERIS model is a bottom-up energy system model. Both studies mentioned
above cover six learning technologies. MESSAGE is also a bottom-up system engineering model. Like the other bottom-up energy system models, it determines how
much of the available resources and technologies are used to satisfy a particular end-use demand, subject to various constraints, while minimizing total discounted
energy system costs.

¢ For a review of the literature on learning curves, including 42 learning rates of energy technologies, see McDonald and Schrattenholzer, (2001).

¢ For a discussion and explanation of similar (and even wider) variations in estimated learning rates for wind power, see Séderholm and Sundavist (2003) and Nejj et al.

"Figure 11.9 shows the effects of introducing ETC into the
models for the 550 and 450 ppm CO, stabilization scenarios
2000-2100. The reductions in carbon prices and GDP are
substantial for many studies in both stabilization cases when
ETC is introduced. The effects on CO, reductions show that
including ETC in the models leads to earlier reductions in
emissions. It should be noted that the reduction of costs in IMCP
models is not mainly driven by LBD. The assumptions about
the crowding-out of conventional R&D by low-carbon R&D
and the availability of mitigation options (models have different
sets of options) are more important factors determining costs and
mitigation profiles than LBD (Edenhofer et al., 2006b, p.101—
104). One major research challenge is to test the influence of
these aspects of ETC on current technologies by econometric
and backcasting methods, fitting the models to historical data.
"	Text
"Figure 11.9 emphasizes the range and the uncertainty of
the results for induced technological change!® from climate
policies. The potential of ETC to reduce mitigation costs
varies remarkably between different model types. For a
450 ppm CO,-only concentration stabilization level at the
upper end of the range, including ETC in the model reduces
mitigation costs by about 90%, but at the lower end it makes
no difference (Edenhofer et al. 2006b, p. 74). The averages
also somewhat exaggerate the effects of ETC because there are
other assumptions that affect the costs, as evident in a meta-
analysis of the macro-economic costs of mitigation undertaken
for the UK Treasury’s Stern Review (Barker et al., 2006b).
An example is the use of tax/permit revenues, as discussed
in 11.4.4 above. This study combines the IMCP results on
costs with earlier data on post-SRES scenarios (Repetto and
Austin, 1997; Morita et al., 2000) so that the effects of other
assumptions can be identified. The average effects of including
ETC in the IMCP models by 2030 for pathways to 550 and
450 ppm CO,-only are reduced from 1.1 and 2.7% of global
GDP compared to baseline, as shown in Figure 11.9, to 0.4 and
1.3% respectively using the full equation of the meta-analysis,
which allows for individual model outliers, time and scenario
effects as well as the approaches and assumptions adopted by
the modellers. In other words, allowing for technologies to
respond to climate policies reduces the GDP costs of Category
III stabilization, as estimated by the IMCP models, by 1.3% by
2030. Costs across models of 2.1% without ETC, but allowing
for emissions trading and backstop technologies, are reduced to
0.8% GDP by 2030 with ETC. The ETC effects become more

that while energy prices have a swift and significant effect on
shifting the mix of patents towards energy-related activities,
government-sponsored energy R&D has no significant effect.
While not addressing efforts to encourage private-sector R&D,
this work casts doubt on the effectiveness of government-
sponsored low-GHG research by itself as a mitigation option.

capture all the benefits of their investment, there is a second
market failure. This implies that at least two instruments should
be included for policy optimization (Clarke and Weyant,
2002, p.332; Fischer, 2003; Jaffe et al., 2005). Even without
the spillover effect, however, the advantage of models with
endogenous technological change is their potential to model the

"Surprising, few models have explored this question of
mitigation versus technology policies, and they have focused
instead on the cost assessments reviewed above. Those studies
that have looked at this question find that technology policies
alone tend to have smaller impacts on emissions than mitigation
policies (Nordhaus, 2002; Fischer and Newell, 2004; Popp, 2006b;
Yang and Nordhaus, 2006). In other words, it is more important
to encourage the use of technologies than to encourage their
development. On the other hand, with the existence of spillovers,
technology policies alone may lead to larger welfare gains (Otto
et al., 2006). However, the same study points out that an even
better policy (in terms of improving welfare) is to fix the R&D
market failure throughout the economy. Given the difficulty in
correcting the economy-wide market failure (e.g., through more
effective patent protection or significantly increased government
spending on research), it may be unrealistic to expect successful
correction within the narrow area of energy R&D. This is true
despite our ability to model such results.

"baseline effects: baseline assumptions about the role of
technology that generate relatively low emission scenarios
can leave little opportunity for further ETC effects;

the assumption of the inefficient use of resources in the
baseline (distinct from market failure associated with
greenhouse gas emissions and climate change): this
provides opportunities for policy to improve otherwise
inefficient private decisions and may even raise welfare.
Spillovers were an example of this in the Sijm (2004)
discussion; some simulations also include inefficient
energy investment decisions.

how the investment decision is modelled: recursive savings
decisions, as opposed to foresight and intertemporal opti-
mization, provide less opportunity for investment and R&D
to expand. In the Sijm (2004) context, less responsiveness in
aggregate investment and R&D implies more crowding-out.
the modelling of substitution towards a backstop techno-
logy (such as a carbon-free energy source available at
constant, albeit initially high, marginal cost): this can
substantially affect the results. For example, if investment
in the technology is endogenous and involves learning-
by-doing, costs can fall dramatically. Popp (2006a, p.168)
goes further, and shows that the addition of a backstop
technology by itself can have a larger effect on mitigation
costs than the addition of LBD. These results are also
confirmed by the IMCP study (Edenhofer et al., 2006b,
p.214). However, investment in backstop technologies
requires time-consistent policies (Montgomery and Smith,
2006). It is therefore debatable to what extent the indicated
potential for cost reduction can be realized under real-world
conditions where a global, long-term and time-consistent
climate policy has yet to be implemented.

accompany declining average costs over time (Stern, 2006).

"Many analyses in this report emphasize that efficient
mitigation will require a mix of incentives: regulatory measures
to overcome barriers to energy efficiency; funding and other
support for innovation; and carbon prices to improve the
economic attractiveness of energy efficiency and of low-carbon
sources, and to provide incentives for low-carbon innovation
and CCS. Most of the regulatory and R&D measures are sector-
specific and are discussed in the respective sectoral chapters (4—
10). Some implications of innovation processes are discussed
below. Most global models focus on the additional costs of
mitigation in the form of shadow prices or marginal costs, and
the resulting changes that would be delivered by carbon prices.
The carbon prices reached by 2030 are discussed in Section
11.4.4 above. The levels and trends in these prices are crucial to
the transition processes.
"	Text
"There are two reasons for these trends. First, there are
strong indications in the literature that improvements in energy
efficiency with current technologies have greater potential
at lower cost (see Chapters 5—7). This is apparent from the
sectoral assessments summarized in Table 11.3, where energy
efficiency accounts for nearly all the potential available at
negative cost (particularly in buildings), and at least as much
as the potential available from switching to lower carbon fuels
and technologies in energy supply, for costs in the range up
to 20 US$/tCO, -eq. The second reason is that most models
assume some inertia in the capital stock and diffusion of
supply-side technologies, but not of many demand-side
technologies. This slows down the penetration of low-carbon
supply sources even when carbon prices rise enough (or when
costs fall sufficiently) to make them economic. Some end-
use technologies (such as appliances or vehicles) do have a
capital lifetime that is much shorter than major supply-side
investments; but there are very important caveats to this, as
discussed below.
"	Text
"The time trend of carbon prices after 2030 is important but
specific to each model. Some models maintain a constant rate
of price increase that largely reflects the discount rate employed
(they establish an emissions time-path to reflect this). Two
models in the EMF studies, for example, assume increases in
carbon prices of about 5.5% per year and over 6% per year that
are constant throughout the century. In this approach, carbon
prices roughly treble over the period 2030-2050, and every two
decades thereafter. Two models in the IMCP studies also use
constant, and much lower, growth rates for prices that vary with
the stabilization constraint. Edenhofer et al. (2006b) find that
real carbon prices for stabilization targets rise with time in the
early years for all models, with some models showing a decline
in the optimal price after 2050 due to the accumulated effects
of LBD and positive spillovers on economic growth. In these
cases, a high-price policy in the earlier years may generate
innovation that provides benefits in later years. In all these
models, the rates of change frequently reflect intrinsic model
parameters (notably the discount rate) and do not depend much
on the stabilization target, which is reached by adjusting the
starting carbon price instead. However, most but not all models
with endogenous technical change have rates of carbon price
increase that decline over time, and two models actually result
in carbon price falls as technological systems mature.
"	Text
"Most studies suggest that GHG mitigation shifts over time
from energy efficiency improvements to the decarbonization
of supply. This is the clear trend in the global scenarios survey
in Chapter 3 (Figure 3.23), and also in the time-path plots of
energy against carbon intensity changes in the models in the
IMCP studies (Edenhofer et a/., 2006b). It is also true of the
national long-term studies surveyed in Chapter 3 (Table 3.7);
of the detailed sectoral assessments of Chapters 4-10; and
the IEA’s ETP study (IEA, 2006a). In the first quarter of this
century, the majority of global emission savings are associated
with end-use savings in buildings and, to a lesser degree, in
industry and transport. Moreover, despite important savings
in electricity use in these sectors, economies in mitigation
scenarios tend to become more electrified (Edmonds et al.,
2006). In the second quarter of this century, the degree of
decarbonization of supplies starts to dominate efficiency
savings as a result of a mix of strategies including CCS
and diverse low-carbon energy sources. In the IEA study,
the power sector consists of more than 50% non-fossil
generation by 2050, and half of the remainder is made up
of coal plants with CCS. The power sector still tends to
dominate emission savings by 2030, even at lower carbon
prices (see also Table 11.5), but obviously the degree of
decarbonization is less.

sectors, more than 80% is estimated to be economic at a cost
below 50 US$/tCO,-eq. Moreover, the lowest proportions are

at less than 50 US$/tCO,-eq for the total energy sector (supply,

CO, reductions by 2030 that global top-down studies consider
to be necessary for trajectories consistent with stabilization in
the Category III range (Figure 11.7 (a), in the range 25-40%
reduction of CO, which, against the central baseline projection
of 37-40 GtCO,-eq (WEO/A2) for energy-related emissions
that is used for the bottom-up estimates, equates to 10-16
GtCO,-eq. Incidentally, this also equates to global emissions in

"reductions. By contrast with the rising prices in most ‘optimal’
stabilization trajectories, some global models have been run with
constant prices. Perhaps the most extensive, the IEA-ETP (2006a)
study (MAP scenario), returns global CO, emissions roughly
equal to 2005 levels by 2050 (more than halving emissions
from reference). This is consistent with a trajectory towards
category III stabilization at around 550 ppm CO,-eq, with carbon
prices rising to 24 US(2000)$/tCO, ($87/tC) by 2030 and then
remaining fixed. The IEA study emphasizes the combination of
end-use efficiency in buildings, industry and transport, together
with the decarbonization of power generation as indicated. In
other global studies that report sectoral results, the power sector
dominates emission savings even in the weaker category IV
scenarios. Some other models with detailed energy sectors do
not force a constantly rising price or display periods of relatively
stable prices along with stable or declining emissions.!7
"	Text
"The capital stock lifetime of industrial and forestry systems
(discussed further below) means that it takes some decades for
the impact of a given carbon price to work its way through in
terms of delivered reductions.!8 The assessment of timing is
complicated by the fact that most global stabilization studies
model a steadily rising price with ‘perfect foresight’. However,
Figure 11.7(c) confirms that almost all models project prices
of at least 20 US$/tCO,-eq by 2030, and some breach the 50
US$/tCO,-eq level earlier in that decade, as might be expected
in order to secure the required reductions by 2030. Applying
the same statistical framing as Chapter 3, the analysis of price
trends confirms that global carbon prices in more than 80% of
the Category III stabilization studies cross within the range
$20-S0/tCO,-eq during the decade 2020-30. These diverse
strands of evidence therefore suggest a high level of confidence
that carbon prices of 20-50 US$/tCO-eq (75-185 US$/tC-eq)
reached globally in 2020-2030 and sustained or increased
thereafter would deliver deep emission reductions by mid-
century consistent with stabilization at about 550 ppm CO)-eq
(category III levels). To depict the impact in the models, such
prices would have to be implemented in a stable and predictable
manner and all investors would need to plan accordingly, at the
discount rates embodied in the models.
"	Text
"The carbon price results are consistent with the technology
cost analyses in Chapter 4. These suggest that price levels in the
20-50 US$/tCO, range should make both CCS and a diversity
of low-carbon power generation technologies economic on a
global scale, with correspondingly large reduction potential
attributed to the power sector in this cost range (Table 11.8).
Newell, Jaffe & Stavins (2006) focus on the economics of
CCS at prices within this range, noting that the carbon prices
required will depend not only on CCS technology but also
upon the reference alternative. Schumacher and Sands (2006)
also focus on CCS but, in the context of the German energy
system, conclude that a similar range is critical ‘for CCS as
well as advanced wind technologies to play a major role’
(p. 3941). Riahi et al. (2004) project coal-based CCS costs up to
53 US$/tCO2. Corresponding reductions may accrue, whether
a carbon price is considered to be implemented directly or as
the incentive from certified emission reduction (CER) credits.
Shrestha (2004) projects that “business-as-usual’ shares of coal
in power generation by 2025 will be 46%, 78% and 85% in
Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Thailand respectively, but an effective
CER price of 20 US$/tCO, from 2006 onwards would reduce
the share of coal to 18%, 0% and 45% respectively in the three
countries by 2025. Natural gas and, to a lesser extent renewables,
oil and electricity imports are the main beneficiaries.

for supply) are currently much more expensive than carbon-
based fuels. As R&D, investment and associated learning
accumulates, their costs will decline, and market scale may
grow. Rising carbon prices bring forward the time when they
become competitive (indeed, many such technologies might
never become competitive without carbon pricing). The faster

such increases with confidence in a clear and stable policy
environment — the sooner such technologies will become

decarbonize the power sector over a period of decades. Some of
the models display a second period with a similar pattern, later

diffuses. In integrated Category III scenarios, such scenarios
can also deliver more potential abatement in the transport
sector (at a higher cost), partly because several of the low-
carbon transport technologies depend on the prior availability
of low-carbon electricity. Assumptions about the availability of
petroleum and the costs of carbon-based ‘backstop’ liquid fuels

A study of the US paper industry found that ‘an increase in
the rate of capital turnover is the most important factor in
permanently changing carbon emission profiles and energy
efficiency’ (Davidsdottir and Ruth, 2004). Similarly, emission
reductions in the UK power sector were largely driven by the
retirement of old, inefficient coal plant during the 1990s, through
sulphur regulations which meant plant owners were faced with
the choice of either retrofitting stock or retiring it (Eyre, 2001).

potential to forestall the construction of carbon-intensive stock

"Energy system inertia provides another dimension to the
time scales involved. It has taken at least 50 years for each
major energy source to move from 1% penetration to a major
position in global supplies. Such long time scales — and the even
longer periods associated with interactions between systems
— imply that, for stabilization, higher inertia brings forward the
date at which abatement must begin to start meeting any given
constraint, and lowers the subsequent emissions trajectory (Ha-
Duong et al., 1997). In the context of stabilization at 550 ppm
CO,, van Vuuren et al. (2004) and Schwoon and Tol (2006)
demonstrate that higher inertia in the energy system brings
forward mitigation.?!

"Ata global scale, van Vuuren et al. (2004) present a systematic
set of results showing the effects of different time profiles for
carbon prices in studies that combine the representation of inertia
and induced innovation. A carbon price that rises linearly to 82
US$/tCO, by 2030 reduces emissions by 40% by 2030 if the
tax is introduced in 2020 and raised sharply, but by 55% if it is
introduced in 2000 and increased more slowly. Van Vuuren et al.
do not describe the impact on subsequent trajectories, but clearly
the capital stock endowment differs substantially. Moreover,
Lecocq etal. (1998) demonstrate that, in the face of uncertainty, an
efficient approach may include greater effort directed at reducing
investment in longer-lived carbon intensive infrastructure, over
and above the incentives of any uniform carbon price.

"Chapter 3 (Section 3.6) emphasizes the importance of
‘hedging’ strategies based upon sequential ‘act-then-learn’
decision-making. Mitigation over the next couple of decades
that would be consistent with enabling stabilization at lower
levels (Categories I, II or III) does not irrevocably commit
the world to such levels. The major numerical addition to the
literature in this vein appears to be that of Mori (2006). Using
the MARIA model, he analyses optimal strategies to limit the
global temperature increase to 2.5 °C given uncertainty about
climate sensitivity in the range of 1.5-4.5 °C per doubling of
CO,-equivalent. When there is no uncertainty, only the above-
average sensitivities require significant mitigation in the next
few decades. In the context of uncertainty, however, the optimal
strategy is to keep global emissions relatively constant at present
levels until the uncertainty is resolved, after which they may
rise or decline depending upon the findings.
"	Text
"However, beyond a certain point, inertia can also dramatically
increase the cost of stabilization, particularly when infrastructure
constraints are likely to limit the growth of new industries more
than established ones. Manne & Richels (2004) illustrate that if
global total contributions from new (renewable) power sources
are limited to 1% by 2010 and treble each decade thereafter, the
world has little choice other than to continue expanding carbon-
intensive power systems out to around 2030. This feature appears
to drive their finding of high costs for 450 ppm CO, stabilization,
since much of this stock then has to be retired in subsequent
decades to meet the constraint. This pattern contrasts sharply
with some other studies, such the MIT study (McFarland et al.,
2004) that states an opposing time profile based partly upon the
rapid deployment of natural gas plant, including CCS. Crassous
et al. (2006) also find high costs by assuming that long-lived
infrastructure construction continues without foresight over the
century. If low-carbon transport technologies do not become
available quickly enough, the economy is squeezed as carbon
controls tighten. They also show that the early adoption of
appropriate infrastructure avoids this squeeze and allows lower
costs for carbon control. Drawing partly on more sociological
literature, and the systems innovation literature (Unruh, 2002),
tends to support a view that we are now ‘locked in’ to carbon-
intensive systems, with profound implications: “Carbon lock-in
arises through technological, organizational, social and institutional
co-evolution ... due to the self-referential nature of [this process],

end-use savings, or co-benefits. It is clear that low-carbon
paths consistent with the IEA Map result of returning global

of studies is likely to be less than S—10% of the total investment

quantitative findings from some long-term national modelling

"Several major studies shed light upon the investment
implications of low-carbon scenarios over the next few
decades. The World Bank (2006) estimates that to ‘significantly
de-carbonize power production’ would require incremental
investments of ‘up to’ US $40bn per year globally, of which about
US$30bn per year would be in non-OECD countries. However,
in a comprehensive scenario, this would be offset by the reduced
investment requirements resulting from improved end-use
efficiency. The IEA WEO (2006b) ‘alternative policy scenario’
estimates that an increased investment of US$2.4 trillion in
improved efficiency would be more than offset by US$3 trillion
savings in supply investments. The more aggressive IEA ‘Map’
scenario (IEA, 2006a), that returns emissions to 2005 levels by
2050 (and is consistent with trajectories towards stabilization
between 550 and 650 ppm CO,-eq) as discussed above, reflects
greater impact as a result of switching investment from more
to less carbon-intensive paths. Investments across renewables,
nuclear and CCS are projected of US$7.9 trillion, US$4.5 trillion
of which is offset directly by the reduced investment required
in fossil-fuel power plants. Most of the rest is offset by the
reduced need for transmission and distribution investment and
fuel savings arising from increased energy efficiency. The net
additional cost for the Map scenario out to 2050 is only US$100
billion, about 0.5% of total projected sector investments.

on the point of view adopted. Multiple differences between

differences emanate from the diverse and sometimes distinct
natural endowments and social structures of those regions, as
well as differences in the financial ability to cope with the costs
that may be incurred as a result of the implementation of these
policies. Methodologies that are developed for market-based

"Carbon leakage is defined as the increase in CO, emissions
outside the countries taking domestic mitigation action divided
by the reduction in the emissions of these countries. It has been
demonstrated that an increase in local fossil fuel prices resulting,
for example, from mitigation policies may lead to the re-
allocation of production to regions with less stringent mitigation
tules (or with no rules at all), leading to higher emissions in
those regions and therefore to carbon leakage. Furthermore, a
decrease in global fossil fuel demand and resulting lower fossil
fuel prices may lead to increased fossil fuel consumption in non-
mitigating countries and therefore to carbon leakage as well.
However, the investment climate in many developing countries
may be such that they are not ready yet to take advantage of
such leakage. Different emission constraints in different regions
may also affect the technology choice and emission profiles in
regions with fewer or no constraints because of the spillover of
learning (this is discussed in Section 11.7.6).

GTAP-EG to analyse the effects of the Kyoto Protocol. He
reports a leakage rate of 10.5%, with an uncertainty range of
5-15% covering different assumptions about aggregation,
trade elasticities and capital mobility, but his main purpose is
to trace back non-Annex B increases in CO, to their sources
in the regions and sectors of Annex B. The chemicals and iron
and steel sectors make the highest contributions (20% and 16%
respectively), with the EU being the largest regional source
(41% of total leakage). The highest bilateral leakage is from the
EU to China (over 10% of the total). Kuik and Gerlagh (2003)
use a similar GTAP-E model and conclude that, for Annex I
Kyoto-style action, the main reason for leakage is the reduction
in world energy prices, rather than substitution within Annex I.
They find that the central estimate of 11% leakage is sensitive
to assumptions about trade-substitution elasticities and fossil-
fuel supply elasticities and to lower import tariffs under the
Uruguay Round, and they state a range of 6% to 17% leakage.

an important element in the evaluation of environmental

Due to spillover effects, it is difficult to determine precisely
the net mitigation potential for sectors and regions, and
the effects of policies. An added complication is that the
effects may be displaced over time. The measurement of the
effects is also complex because effects are often indirect and
secondary, although they can also accumulate to make local
or regional mitigation action either ineffective or the source
of global transformation. Much of the literature recognizes
the existence of spillover effects. However, uncertainty and

"Some researchers who use general-equilibrium models
(e.g. Babiker, 2005) conclude that spillover will, given certain
assumptions, render mitigation action ineffective or worse if it
is confined to Annex | countries. Other researchers (e.g. Grubb
et al., 2002a; Sijm et al., 2004) argue that spillovers from
Annex Laction, implemented via induced technological change,
could have substantial effects on sustainable development,
with emission intensities from developing countries being a
fraction of what they would be otherwise. ‘However, no
global models yet exist that could credibly quantify directly
the process of global diffusion of induced technological
change.’ (Grubb et al., 2002b, p.303). It is important to empha-
size the uncertainties in estimating spillover effects, as well
as uncertainties in estimating potential mitigation costs and
benefits. In the modelling of spillovers through international
trade, researchers rely on different approaches (bottom-up
or top-down, for example), different assumptions (perfect/
imperfect or ‘Armington’ substitution) and estimates of
parameters when signs and magnitudes are disputed.
Many of the models used to estimate the costs of mitigation
focus on substitution effects and set aside information, policy
and political spillovers, as well as the induced development

may not only significantly affect development and performance
in non-abating developing countries, but may also cause large
changes in the economic costs of emission abatement for other
industrialized nations.’ They estimate that the US should pay
OPEC and Mexico estimated compensation of 0.7 billion US$
annually to offset the adverse impacts on these regions and that
the EU should pay the same amount to the US to account for
the positive spillover.

"However, other studies point to real world conditions that
make these outcomes unlikely. Significant carbon leakage arises
when internationally tradeable energy-intensive production
moves abroad to non-abating regions. This is frequently referred
to as a competitiveness concern. In industrialized countries,
these sectors account for 15-20% of CO, emissions (IEA,
2004). Results with high leakage therefore reflect conditions in
which countries implement policies that lead to most emission
savings being obtained by industrial relocation (to areas of
lower-cost, and in some cases less efficient, production), rather
than in the less mobile sectors (such as power generation,
domestic, services etc). In practice, most countries have tended
to adjust policies to avoid any such outcome (for example
through derogation, exemption or protection for such sectors).

an outlier, there is a 0.7% increase for countries in transition

welfare most in developing countries. However, the model does
not include induced technological change or environmental co-

"Sijmetal. (2004) providea literature review and an assessment
of the potential effects of Annex I mitigation associated with the

discussed in this paper are considered in section 11.7.6
below. In the empirical analysis of effects in energy-intensive
industries, the modelling studies reporting high leakage rates
look at many other factors in addition to price competitiveness.
They conclude that, in practice, carbon leakage is unlikely to
be substantial because transport costs, local market conditions,
product variety and incomplete information all favour local
production. They argue that a simple indicator of carbon
leakage is insufficient for policymaking. Szabo et al. (2006)
report production leakage estimates of 29% by 2010 for cement
given an EU ETS allowance price of about 50 US$/tCO, and
a detailed model of the global industry. Leakage rates rise with
the allowance price. More generally, Reinaud (2005) surveys
estimates of leakage for energy-intensive industries (steel,
cement, newsprint and aluminium) assuming the EU ETS. She
comes to a similar conclusion to Sijm ef al. (2004) and finds
that, with the free allocation of CO, allowances, ‘any leakage
would be considerably lower than previously projected, at least
in the near term.’ (p. 10). However, ‘the ambiguous results of
the empirical studies in both positive and negative spillovers
warrant further research in this field.’ (p.179).

"The impact of mitigation policies on trade within a region
and between regions as a result of spillover is linked through
capital flows from one country to another (within a region) or
from one region to another, as individual investors and firms
look for a higher rate of return on their investments which are
considered by the receiving countries to be Foreign Direct
Investment (FDI). Different market regulations and the flow
of goods and services are influenced by mitigation policies,
and the resulting spillover make ‘measuring the welfare cost
of climate change policies a real challenge, raising difficult
issues of micro- and macro-economics: cost-benefit analysis on
the one hand, foreign trade and international specialization on
the second hand’ (Bernard and Vielle, 2003). Partly for these
reasons, the literature is sparse and the effects of different

"As discussed in 11.7.2, perhaps one of the most important ways
in which spillovers from mitigation action in one region affect
the others is through their effect on world energy prices. When
a region reduces its fossil fuel demand as a result of mitigation
policy, it will reduce the world demand for that commodity
and so put downward pressure on the prices. Depending on
responses from producers of fossil fuels, oil, gas or coal prices
may fall, leading to losses of revenue for the producers, and
lower import costs for the consumers. Demand for alternative,
low-carbon fuels may increase. Three distinct spillover effects
have been identified for non-mitigating countries. First, income
for producers of fossil fuels will decline as the quantity sold
is reduced, causing welfare losses and unemployment along
with associated problems. Second, consuming nations will face
lower prices for imported energy and may reduce subsidies
or allow domestic energy prices to fall so that they tend to
consume more, leading to carbon leakage as discussed above.
Third, those non-mitigating countries producing low-carbon or
alternative fuels will see an increase in demand and prices, with
potentially positive effects on the markets for bioenergy.

studies on existing carbon/energy taxes seem to indicate that
competitive losses are not significant’. They therefore support
the conclusions of the TAR, namely that ‘reported effects on

a significant loss of competitiveness from tax-based policies to

an estimate of OPEC losses of 63 billion US$ a year or about

with demand. Another scenario estimates the effect of an oil-
price protection strategy, assuming that all major oil-producing

that decarbonization strategies generate significant direct cost
savings because of reduced air pollution costs, highlighting the
urgency of an integrated approach for greenhouse gas mitigation
and air pollution control strategies.

"Anthropogenic GHG emissions are intricately linked to the
structure of consumption patterns and levels of activity, which
themselves are driven by a wide range of non-climate-related
policy interests. These include policies on air quality, public
health, energy security, poverty reduction, trade, FDI/investment
regimes, industrial development, agriculture, population, urban
and rural development, taxation and fiscal policies. There are
therefore common drivers behind policies addressing economic
development and poverty alleviation, employment, energy
security, and local environmental protection on the one hand,
and GHG mitigation on the other. Put another way, there are
multiple drivers for actions that reduce emissions, and they
produce multiple benefits.

"The existence of spillover effects also changes the theoretical
conclusions in the economics literature. In the pure competition-
equilibrium model, the most efficient policy is an equal rate of
carbon tax for every sector and region. Rosendahl (2004) shows
that, for maximum efficiency with spillovers and learning-by-
doing, the carbon tax should be higher in those sectors and
regions with the highest potential for technological progress.
This is a general argument for stronger mitigation in those sectors
and countries where technological progress is most likely to be
accelerated by higher taxes on carbon use. In a game-theory
context, with the shared benefits of R&D improving energy
efficiencies, Kemfert (2004, p. 463) finds that ‘full cooperation
on climate control and technological improvements benefits all
nations in comparison to a unilateral strategy.’

"Although the technologies for CO, reduction in the electricity
sectors are accessible, their dissemination still faces some
challenges, especially in economies with low purchasing power
and educational levels (Kumar ef al., 2003). An additional
issue is that technology sharing by the fossil-fuel energy
suppliers has been severely limited to date, probably due to the
industrial organization of coal, oil and gas production, which is
dominated by a few large private and state companies. Unlike,
for example, new IT technologies, which quickly become
industry standards, newly developed energy-related technology
providing a competitive advantage generally becomes available
to competitors slowly. However, modelling of the spillovers
and the evolution of technologies, as well as structural changes
in corporate management, require a better understanding of
knowledge production and the knowledge transfer process
within and between industries, and of the role and efficiency
of transfer institutions such as universities, technology transfer
centres and consultancy companies (Haag and Liedl, 2001).

"Potential synergies and trade-offs between measures directed
at non-climate objectives and GHG mitigation have been
addressed by an increasing number of studies. The literature
points out that, in most cases, climate mitigation is not the
goal, but rather an outgrowth of efforts driven by economic,
security, or local environmental concerns. The most promising
policy approaches, then, will be those that capitalize on natural
synergies between climate protection and development priorities
to advance both simultaneously. Policies directed towards other
environmental problems, such as air pollution, can often be
adapted at low or no cost to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
simultaneously. Such integration/policy coherence is especially
relevant for developing countries, where economic and social
development — not climate change mitigation — are the top
priorities (Chandler et al., 2002). Since the TAR, a wealth of
new literature has addressed potential synergies and trade-offs
between GHG mitigation and air pollution control, employment
and energy security concerns.

"Despite the large range of benefit estimates, all studies agree
that monetized health benefits make up a substantial fraction of
mitigation costs. Depending on the stringency of the mitigation
level, the source sector, the measure and the monetary value
attributed to mortality risks, health benefits range from 30 to
50% of estimated mitigation costs (Burtraw et al., 2003; Proost
and Regemorter, 2003) up to a factor of three to four (Aunan
et al., 2004; McKinley et al., 2005). Particularly in developing
countries, several of the studies reviewed indicate that there is
scope for measures with benefits that exceed mitigation costs
(no-regret measures).

"Some assessments are entirely bottom-up and static, and focus
on a single sector or sub-sector. Others include multi-sector or
economy-wide general-equilibrium effects, taking a combination
of bottom-up and top-down approaches. In addition, there are
numerous methodological distinctions between studies. There
are, for example, different baseline emission projections, air
quality modelling techniques, health impact assessments,
valuation methods, etc. These methodological differences,
together with the scarcity of data, are a major source of
uncertainties when estimating co-benefits. While the recent
literature provides new insights into individual co-benefits (for
example in the areas of health, agriculture, ecosystems, cost
savings, etc.), it is still a challenge to derive a complete picture
of total co-benefits.
"	Text
"The benefits also largely depend on the source sector in
which the mitigation measure is implemented. Decarbonization
strategies that reduce fossil fuel consumption in sectors with a
strong impact on population exposure (such as domestic stoves
for heating and cooking, especially in developing countries) can
typically result in health benefits that are 40 times greater than
a reduction in emissions from centralized facilities with high
stacks such as power plants (Wang and Smith, 1999). Mestl
et al., (2005) show that the local health benefits of reducing
emissions from power plants in China are small compared to
abating emissions from area sources and small industrial boilers.
A third factor is the extent to which air pollution emission
controls have already been applied. Health benefits are larger in
countries and sectors where pollutants are normally emitted in
an uncontrolled way, for instance for small combustion sources
in developing countries.
"	Text
"Several authors conducted an economic valuation of these
health effects in order to arrive at a monetary quantification
of the benefits, which can then be directly compared with
mitigation costs. While the monetization of health benefits
remains controversial, especially with respect to the monetary
value attributed to mortality risks in an international context,
calculated benefits range from 2 US$/tCO, (Burtraw et al.,
2003; Joh et al., 2003) up to a hundred or more US$/tCO2 (Han,
2001; Aunan et al., 2004; Morgenstern et al., 2004). This wide
range is partially explained by differences in methodological
approaches. The lower estimates emerge from studies that
consider health impacts from only one air pollutant (such as SO,
or NO,), while the higher estimates cover multiple pollutants,
including fine particulate matter, which has been recently shown
to have the greatest impact. Differences in mortality evaluation
methods and results also constitute a substantial source of
discrepancy in the estimated value of health impact as well.
"	Text
"Since the TAR, an increasing number of studies have
demonstrated that carbon mitigation strategies result in
significant benefits, not only as a result of improved air quality
in cities, but also from reduced levels of regional air pollution.
These benefits affect a larger share of the population and result
from lower levels of secondary air pollutants. Although the
literature employs a variety of methodological approaches,
a consistent picture emerges from the studies conducted for
industrialized regions in Europe and North America, as well as
for developing countries in Latin America and Asia (see Table
11.18). Mitigation strategies aiming at moderate reductions of
carbon emissions in the next 10 to 20 years (typically involving
CO, reductions between 10 to 20% compared to the business-
as-usual baseline) also reduce SO, emissions by 10 to 20%,
and NO, and PM emissions by 5 to 10%. The associated health
impacts are substantial. They depend, inter alia, on the level at
which air pollution emissions are controlled and how strongly
the source sector contributes to population exposure. Studies
calculate for Asian and Latin American countries several tens of
thousands of premature deaths that could be avoided annually
as a side-effect of moderate CO, mitigation strategies (Wang
and Smith, 1999; Aunan ef al., 2003; O’Connor et al., 2003;
Vennemo et al., 2006 for China; Bussolo and O’Connor, 2001
for India; Cifuentes et a/., 2001a; Dessus and O’Connor, 2003;
McKinley et al., 2005 for Latin America). Studies for Europe
(Bye et al., 2002; van Vuuren et al., 2006), North America
(Caton and Constable, 2000; Burtraw et al., 2003) and Korea
(Han, 2001; Joh et al., 2003) reveal fewer, but nevertheless
substantial, health benefits from moderate CO, mitigation

"While a strong body of literature demonstrates that there
are important co-benefits from GHG mitigation and health
benefits from improved air quality, there has been less
research addressing co-benefits from improved agricultural
production. The potential positive, long-term, effect of higher
CO, concentrations on plants can be counteracted by short-
term damage from increased air pollution. The effects of
tropospheric ozone exposure on plant tissues and crop yields
are well established, and the scientific literature has already
been reviewed in US EPA (1996) and EC (1999). Chameides et
al. (1994) estimate that 10-35% of the world’s grain production
is in locations where ozone exposure may reduce crop yields.
Surface ozone levels are sensitive to, inter alia, NO, and VOC
emissions from fossil-fuel-burning power plants, industrial
boilers, motor vehicle exhaust, gasoline retail outlets, and N-
fertilizer-induced soil emissions of NO,.

"Using an atmospheric ozone formation model and an
economic general-equilibrium model, O’Connor et al. (2003)
find, for a CO, mitigation strategy in China, that the monetary
benefits from increased agricultural productivity due to lower
ground-level ozone are comparable to the health benefits.
Together, these benefits would allow China a 15-20% CO,
reduction without suffering a welfare loss. Agricultural benefits
have important distributional implications. When agricultural
effects are not taken into consideration, poor rural households
experience welfare losses from carbon mitigation even at low
levels of abatement. Once agricultural effects are considered,
rural households in this study enjoy welfare gains up to a ten
percent abatement rate. So while a purely health-based measure
of ancillary benefits tends to show benefits from a climate
commitment to be urban-biased, a broader definition of benefits
alters the picture considerably.
"	Text
"An increasing number of studies demonstrate significant
savings from GHG mitigation strategies on the compliance
costs for such air quality legislation. When there are source-
specific performance standards, fewer plants burning fossil
fuels also imply fewer air pollution control devices. If overall
emissions in a country are capped, for example through national
emission ceilings in the European Union, or by the obligations
of the Gothenburg Protocol of the Convention on Long-
range Transboundary Air Pollution, the lower consumption of
carbonaceous fuels also reduces the costs for complying with
such emission ceilings. This is particularly important since,
in these conditions, countries can avoid implementing more
expensive air pollution control measures. A similar situation
applies when there are legal systems requiring compliance
with ambient air quality standards. Carbon mitigation strategies
that reduce the levels of polluting activities alleviate control
requirements for the remaining sources.

"The co-control of emissions — in other words controlling two
or more distinct pollutants (or gases) that tend to emanate from
a single source through a single set of technologies or policy
measures — is a key element of any integrated approach. Air
pollutants and GHGs are often emitted by the same sources and
so changes in the activity levels of these sources affect both types
of emissions. Technical emission control measures aiming at

"These cost savings are immediate, they do not depend on
controversial judgments on the monetary value of mortality

savings on air pollution control costs of 9.4 billion US$ per

buying permits for 4 billion US$ per year from outside and
implemented domestic measures amounting to 1.4 billion US$
per year, air pollution control costs would decline by 2.4 billion
USS per year in these countries. At the same time, the other

Such near-term secondary benefits of GHG control provide

aggressive than other types of particles, and are also associated
with cancer (HEI, 1999). Mitigation strategies that increase
the use of diesel vehicles without appropriate emission control
devices counteract efforts to manage air quality. At the same
time, concern has been expressed in the literature about the
radiative effects of the emissions of black carbon and organic
matter from diesel vehicles, which might offset the gains from
lower CO2 emissions (Jacobson, 2002). Although both the
US and the EU are moving towards very stringent emission
standards for diesel engines, their adoption by the rest of the
world may be delayed by years.

"pollutants and greenhouse gases vary depending on the type of
greenhouse gas considered. For example, in addition to its role
as a potent GHG, methane acts as a precursor to tropospheric
ozone, together with emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO,),
volatile organic compounds (VOC) and carbon monoxide (CO).
Whereas reductions in NO, and VOC emissions influence local
surface ozone concentrations, reductions in methane emissions
lower the global ozone background and improve surface air
quality everywhere. So reducing methane emissions addresses
simultaneously both the pursuit of improved ozone air quality
and climate change mitigation objectives (Fiore et al., 2002;
Dentener et al., 2004). For instance, West et al. (2006)
estimate the decreases in premature human mortality that can
be attributed to lower surface ozone concentrations resulting
from methane mitigation. Reducing global anthropogenic
methane emissions by 20% starting in 2010 would prevent
approximately 30,000 premature all-cause mortalities globally
in 2030, and approximately 370,000 between 2010 and 2030.
If avoided mortalities are valued at $1 million each, the benefit
of 12 US$/tCO,-equivalent exceeds the marginal cost of
the methane reduction. These benefits of climate-motivated
methane emission reductions are comparable to those estimated
in other studies for CO).

of energy security and climate change, especially following
the rapid increases and fluctuations in commodity prices,
particularly oil, in the period 2004-2006. The concept
of energy security is usually understood to be an issue
of the reliability of energy supplies that is illustrated by
the exposure of oil im-porters to world market prices
(Bauen, 2006) and, as Sullivan and Blyth (2006) point
out, the reliability of electricity systems given the growing
penetration of intermittant renewables, which may require
back-up generation capacity (but see UKERC, 2006).

the Ozone Layer mandates the phase-out of ozone-depleting

bromide. Some of the alternatives to these products, which
are used primarily in refrigeration and in air conditioning,
and for producing insulating foam, have significant GWPs
although these are, in many cases, less than those for the CFCs
and HCFCs. They also can improve the energy efficiency of
some equipment and products in which they are used. In order
to investigate the link between ozone depletion and climate
change, a Special Report was produced by IPCC and the
Technology and Economic Assessment Panel (TEAP) of the
Montreal Protocol (IPCC & TEAP, 2005).

"The possibilities of synergies and trade-offs between
mitigation actions and energy security are very specific to
national circumstances, particularly the relevant fuel mixes as
a result of evolving energy markets, the sectors being targeted
and energy consumption trends (Turton and Barreto, 2006).
The transportation sector, in particular, is characterized by
strong synergies relating to energy supply: measures replacing
oil with domestic biofuels reduce both emissions and reliance
on oil imports. Mitigation action for the electricity sector may
lead to synergies with energy security. For example, a more
decentralized system based on new renewable generation may
reduce gas imports. Alternatively, there may be trade-offs. For
example, security reasons may lead countries to increase their
dependence on internal reserves of coal rather than relying on
natural gas imports (Kuik, 2003).

"Meyer and Lutz (2002) use the COMPASS model to study
the carbon taxes for the G7 countries. They find that recycling
revenues via social security contributions increases employment
by nearly 1% by 2010 in France and Germany, but much less in
US and Japan. Bach et al. (2002), using the models PANTHA
RHEI and LEAN, find that the modest ecological tax reform
enacted in Germany in 1999-2003 increased employment by
0.1 to 0.6% by 2010. This is as much as 250,000 additional
jobs. There is also a 2—2.5% reduction in CO, emissions and
a negligible effect on GDP. The labour intensity of renewable
energy sources has been estimated to be approximately 10
times higher in Poland than that of traditional coal power (0.1—
0.9 jobs/GWh compared to 0.01—0.1 jobs/GWh). Given this
assumption, government targets for renewable energy would
create 30,000 new jobs by 2010 (Jeeninga et al., 1999).

"Whether in the form of synergies or trade-offs, there is a
growing recognition of the critical linkages that exist between
climate change and energy security, and the fact that energy
prices still have yet to reflect these ‘externalities’ effectively
(Bauen, 2006). The inability to manage either one of these
threats could result in significant economic and social costs
(Turton and Barreto, 2006). Measures that successfully address
both issues therefore have the potential to provide signficant
social and economic benefits. In conclusion, it seems likely
that climate change and energy security pressures will become
more acute as international development proceeds. Public
policies to address either of these issues can take many forms
and their combination makes the effects uncertain, implying a
gap in understanding their synergies and trade-offs (Blyth and
Lefevre, 2004).

"Anumber of studies point out that investments in greenhouse
gas mitigation could have a greater impact on employment
than investments in conventional technologies. The net
impact on employment in Europe in the manufacturing and
construction industries of a 1% annual improvement in energy
efficiency has been shown to induce a positive effect on total
employment (Jeeninga et al., 1999). The effect has been shown
to be substantially positive, even after taking into account all
direct and indirect macro-economic factors such as the reduced
consumption of energy, impact on energy prices, reduced VAT,
etc. (European Commission, 2003) The strongest effects are
seen in the area of semi-skilled labour in the building trades,
which also accounts for the strongest regional policy effects.
Furthermore, the European Commission (2005) estimates that
a 20% saving on present energy consumption in the European
Union by 2020 has the potential to create, directly or indirectly,
up to one million new jobs in Europe.

"Nonetheless, at the local level, there is a growing recognition
that there are in fact important overlaps, particularly when natural,
energy and sequestration systems intersect. Examples include
bioenergy, forestry and agriculture (Morlot and Agrawala,
2004). This recognition is thought to be particularly relevant for
developing countries, particularly the least developed countries,
which rely extensively on natural resources for their energy
and development needs. More specifically, there is a growing
literature analyzing opportunities for linking adaptation and
mitigation in agroforestry systems (Verchot, 2004; Verchot et
al., 2005), in forestry and agriculture (Dang et al., 2003), and in
coastal systems (Ehler et al., 1997).

"At the national level, mitigation and adaptation are often cast
as competing priorities for policy makers (Cohen et al., 1998;
Michaelowa, 2001). In other words, interest groups will fight
about the limited funds available in a country for addressing
climate change, providing analyses of how countries might
then make optimal decisions about the appropriate adaptation-
mitigation ‘mix’. Using a public choice model, Michaelowa
(2001) finds that mitigation will be preferred by societies with
a strong climate protection industry and low mitigation costs.
Public pressure for adaptation will depend on the occurrence
of extreme weather events. As technical adaptation measures
will lead to benefits for closely-knit, clearly defined groups who
can organize themselves well in the political process, these will
benefit from subsidy-financed programmes. Changes in society
will become less attractive as benefits are spread more widely.

"Section 4.5.5 covers the impact of climate change on energy
supply, such as extreme events (Easterling et al., 2000), the
effect of warming on infrastructure (such as damage to gas
and oil pipelines caused by permafrost melt) and changes in
water levels for hydro projects (Nelson et al., 2002). There is
a broad consensus that a decentralized energy system (4.3.8)
might be more robust in coping with extreme events. Areas that
clearly link mitigation and adaptation include, in particular,
hydro, biomass and nuclear. Changes in rainfall patterns/
glacier melting will clearly impact hydro power and future
hydro as a feasible carbon-neutral alternative. The same could
be said for biomass, in which too much land used for energy
crops may affect both food supply and forestry cover, thereby
reducing the ability of communities to adapt to the impacts of
climate change, reducing food supplies and therefore making
them more vulnerable. Nuclear power generation has been
vulnerable to shortages of cooling water due to heat-waves
resulting in high ambient temperatures, like those in the EU
in 2003 and 2006. This problem is expected to intensify with
the rise in these climate-related events. There are opportunities
for synergies between mitigation and adaptation in the area of
energy supply, particularly for rural populations. For example,

"‘This section brings together the effects of climate change
on mitigation action and the effects of mitigation action on
adaptation as identified in Chapters 4 to 10 above. The topic of
adaptation-mitigation linkage is covered in Chapter 2, Section
6, and IPCC (2007b, Chapter 18), which is the main reference
for concepts, definitions, and analyses. The issue of adaptation-
mitigation linkages, particularly when exploring synergies, is
fairly nascent in the published literature: Barker (2003) and
Dessai and Hulme (2003) analyze mitigation and adaptation
linkages as fairly distinctive responses within the context
of integrated assessment models; while Dang et al. (2003)
and Klein et al. (2003) have more explicitly addressed the
issue of whether and how mitigation and adaptation measures
could be more effectively integrated as an overall response to
the threat of climate change. Tol (2005) argues that adaptation
and mitigation are policy substitutes and should be analyzed
as an integrated response to climate change. However, they
are usually addressed in different policy and institutional
contexts, and policies are implemented at different spatial
and temporal scales. This hampers analysis and weakens the
trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation. An exception
is facilitative adaptation (enhancing adaptive capacity). Like
mitigation, it requires long-term policies at the macro-level,
but they also compete for resources.

can often have significant adaptation benefits, particularly in
the areas of forest conservation, afforestation and reforestation,
biomass energy plantations, agro-forestry, and urban forestry.
These projects provide shading, and reduce water evaporation

in the forestry sector can involve mitigation benefits, including
soil and water conservation, agroforestry and biodiversity
conservation.

"Synergies and conflicts between mitigation and adaptation
in the industry sector are highly site-specific (see 7.8). It is
assumed that large firms would not be as vulnerable to flood
risks or weather extremes since they have access to more
financial and technical resources. There appears to be no
literature indicating explicitly how industry could design its
manufacturing and operating processes in such a way that, by
adapting to possible climate change events, it can also help to
reduce GHG emissions associated with their operations. It is
obvious, however, that reducing energy demand would be a
good adaptive and mitigative strategy if power supply (from
hydro power, for example) were at risk from climate change
(Subak et al., 2000). Reducing dependence on cooling water
may also be a good adaptive strategy in some locations, but the
impact on emissions is not clear.

"Most of the literature relating to mitigation-adaptation
linkages concerns the agriculture and forestry sectors. In
particular, there is a growing awareness of the unique contribution
that such synergies could provide for the rural poor, particularly
in the least developed countries: many measures focusing on
sustainable natural resource management policies could provide
both significant adaptation and mitigation benefits, mostly in
the form of sequestration activities (Gundimeda, 2004; Morlot
and Agrawala, 2004; Murdiyarso et al., 2004). Agriculture is, of
course, extremely vulnerable to the impact of climate change,
that affects all aspects related to crop land management, and
particularly areas related to water management (see Sections
8.5 and 8.8). Low-tillage practices are an example of a win-
win technology that reduces erosion and the use of fossil fuels.
As discussed in the energy section, bioenergy can of course play
a significant role in mitigating global GHG emissions, although
the full lifecycle implications of bioenergy options, including
effects on deforestation and agriculture, need to be taken into
account.

"With regard to the increase of biomass energy plantations
as a mitigation measure (see Section 11.3.1.4), there may be
increased competition for land in many regions, with two
crucial effects. First, increased pressure to cultivate what are
currently non-agricultural areas may reduce the area available
to natural ecosystems, increase fragmentation and restrain the
natural adaptive capacity. Secondly, increasing land rents might
make agronomically viable adaptation options unprofitable. An
alternative view is that there is no shortage of land (Bot et al.,
2000; Moreira, 2006), but of investment in land. In this view,
the remedy consists of revenues derived from the energy sector
(through the CDM, for example), both to raise land productivity
through carbon-sequestering soil improvement and to co-
produce food or fibre with biomass residuals for conversion
to bioenergy products (Greene et al., 2004; Read, 2005;
Faaij, 2006; Lehmann et al., 2006; Verchot et al., 2005). Recent
studies suggest that technological progress in agriculture
will outstrip population growth under a variety of SRES
scenarios, leaving enough land for bioenergy cropping, in
the most optimistic scenario, to meet all forecast demands
for primary energy (Hoogwijk et al., 2005).
"	Text
"While it is clear that the impact of climate change on
commercial and residential buildings could be massive,
particularly as a result of extreme events and sea level rises,
there is less appreciation of the major synergies that are possible
between adaptation and mitigation. Modern architecture rarely
takes the prevailing climate into consideration, even though
design options could result in a considerable reduction in the
energy load of buildings, and improve their adaptation to a
changing climate (Larsson, 2003). Nevertheless, there is a
relatively small amount of literature exploring adaptation-
mitigation linkages for new and existing buildings. One
example is cool-roof technology options for adapting to higher
temperatures. These options also provide mitigation advantages
by reducing electricity use and CO, emissions. At the same
time, cool roofs contribute to reducing the formation of ground
level ozone. An example of a conflict between adaptation and
mitigation is the effect of a sizeable increase in heat-waves in
urban centres. An increase of this kind could intensify pressure
for the penetration of inefficient air conditioners, increasing
power demand and CO, emissions, as was the case during the
heat-wave of 1-14 August 2003 in Europe.

The second step consists of reducing the baseline electricity
by the savings from buildings and industry. Electricity savings
are found at relatively low costs and they are therefore expected
to be implemented first. The maximum electricity savings
for the industry and buildings sector were taken from the
sectoral chapters. These have been applied using the share of
the electricity consumption of the sectors in total electricity
consumption (WEO2004). In this step, it was assumed that
the savings were equally distributed across the different power
sources, including low-carbon sources.

"Thirdly, after the fuel switch, emissions avoided from the
other low-carbon substitution options were assessed. The
following technologies were taken into account: renewables
(such as wind, geothermal and solar), bioenergy, hydro, nuclear
and CCS. It was assumed that the new fossil-fuel generation
required according to the baseline was substituted by low-
carbon generation (for each of the cost classes), proportional to
the relative maximum technical potential of the technologies.
The technologies were assumed to penetrate so as to achieve
maximum shares in generation, as described in Table 4.20.

"To arrive at the primary fuel required for final electricity
consumption, an intermediate step is needed. As the World
Energy Outlook 2004 provides statistics on primary energy
supply for electricity and heat combined, the implicit supplies
required for heat were estimated and removed as follows. The
primary energy consumption for electricity supply only was
calculated on the basis of the efficiencies of combined heat and
power, and a correction for the share of heat in total final energy
consumption. The share of heat was calculated from the IEA
Balances for the year 2002 and assumed to be constant over
time. See also Section 4.4.3 for the efficiencies and the baseline
in the year 2030.

to climate goals. But changing development pathways is not

services, including in the areas of policy innovation, monitoring,

"The concept of sustainable development was adopted by
the World Commission on Environment and Development,
and there is agreement that sustainable development involves
a comprehensive and integrated approach to economic, social,
and environmental processes. Discourses on sustainable
development, however, have focused primarily on the
environmental and economic dimensions. The importance
of social, political, and cultural factors is only now getting
more recognition. Integration is essential in order to articulate
development trajectories that are sustainable, including
addressing the climate change problem.
"	Text
"Although still in early stages, there is growing use of
indicators to manage and measure the sustainability of
development at the macro and sectoral levels. This is driven in
part by the increasing emphasis on accountability in the context
of governance and strategy initiatives. At the sectoral level,
progress towards sustainable development is beginning to be
measured and reported by industry and governments using, for
instance, green certification, monitoring tools, and emissions
registries. Review of the indicators illustrates, however, that
few macro-indicators include measures of progress with respect
to climate change (high agreement, much evidence).

"Regarding governments, a substantial body of political theory
identifies and explains the existence of national policy styles or
political cultures. The underlying assumption of this work is
that individual countries tend to process problems in a specific
manner, regardless of the distinctiveness or specific features of
any problem; a national ‘way of doing things’. Furthermore,
the choice of policy instruments is affected by the institutional
capacity of governments to implement the instrument. This
implies that the preferred mix of policy decisions and their
effectiveness in terms of sustainable development and climate
change mitigation strongly depend on national characteristics
(high agreement, much evidence).
"	Text
"Region- and country-specific case studies demonstrate that
different paths and policies can achieve noticeable emissions
reductions, depending on the capacity to realise sustainability
and climate change objectives. These capacities are determined
by the same set of conditions that are closely linked to the
state of development. The mitigative capacity to realise low
emissions can be low due to differentiated national endowments
and barriers, even when significant abatement opportunities
exist. The challenge of implementing sustainable development
exists in both developing and industrialized countries. The
nature of the challenge, however, tends to be different in the
industrialized countries. (high agreement, much evidence).

of how changes in development pathways at the sectoral level

"the extent of mitigation required, and the resulting costs and
benefits. However, in some cases, such as a shift from biomass
cooking to LPG in rural areas of developing countries, it may be
rational to disregard climate change considerations because of
the small increase in emissions compared with its development
benefits (high agreement, medium evidence).

"There is a growing understanding of the possibilities to choose
mitigation options and their implementation such that there is
no conflict with other dimensions of sustainable development;

"Mainstreaming requires that non-climate policies,
programmes, and/or individual actions take climate change
mitigation into consideration, in both developing and developed

depend on both mitigation technologies or practices, and the
underlying development path. Weighing other development
benefits against climate benefits will be a key basis for choosing
development sectors for mainstreaming. Decisions about fiscal
policy, multilateral development bank lending, insurance
practices, electricity markets, petroleum imports security,
forest conservation, for example, which may seem unrelated
to climate policy, can have profound impacts on emissions,

e Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are influenced by but not
rigidly linked to economic growth: policy choices make a
difference.

e Sectors where effective production is far below the maximum
feasible with the same amount of inputs - sectors far from
their production frontier - have opportunities to adopt ‘win-
win-win’ policies. These policies free up resources and
bolster growth, meet other sustainable development goals,
and also reduce GHG emissions relative to baseline.

e Sectors where production is close to optimal given available
inputs — sectors that are closer to the production frontier
- also have opportunities to reduce emissions by meeting
other sustainable development goals. However, the closer
to the production frontier, the more trade-offs are likely to
appear.

e To truly have an effect, what matters is that not only a ‘good’
choice is made at a certain point, but also that the initial
policy is sustained for a long period - sometimes several
decades.

e Itis often not one policy decision, but an array of decisions
that are necessary to influence emissions. This raises the
issue of coordination between policies in several sectors,
and at various scales.

Generally, mitigation options that improve productivity
of resource use, whether energy, water, or land, yield
positive benefits across all three dimensions of sustainable
development. Other categories of mitigation options
have a more uncertain impact and depend on the wider
socioeconomic context within which the option is
implemented.

Climate-related policies, such as energy efficiency, are often
economically beneficial, improve energy security, and reduce
local pollutant emissions. Many energy supply mitigation
options can also be designed to achieve other sustainable
development benefits, such as avoided displacement of
local populations, job creation, and rationalized human
settlements design.

Reducing deforestation can have significant biodiversity,
soil, and water conservation benefits, but may result in loss
of economic welfare for some stakeholders. Appropriately
designed forestation and bioenergy plantations can lead
to reclamation of degraded land, manage water runoff,
retain soil carbon and benefit rural economies, but could
compete with land for agriculture and may be negative for
biodiversity.

There are good possibilities for reinforcing sustainable
development though mitigation actions in most sectors,
but particularly in waste management, transportation, and
building sectors, notably through decreased energy use and
reduced pollution.

analysis does not suggest or imply that non-climate actions can

change is of particular importance to developing countries
because of where they are in their development process and
also because of the particular climate challenges that many of
them face. This chapter, therefore, gives particular emphasis
to the notion of “making development more sustainable”.
Making development more sustainable recognizes that there
are many ways in which societies balance the economic, social,
and environmental, including climate change, dimensions
of sustainable development. It also admits the possibility of
conflict and trade-offs between measures that advance one
aspect of sustainable development while harming another

"	Text
"The concept of sustainable development had its roots in
the idea of a sustainable society (Brown, 1981) and in the
management of renewable and non-renewable resources. The
concept was introduced in the World Conservation Strategy
by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature
(IUCN, 1980). The World Commission on Environment and
Development adopted the concept and launched sustainability
into political, public and academic discourses. The concept was
defined as “development that meets the needs of the present
without compromising the ability of future generations to meet
their own needs” (WCED, 1987; Bojo et al., 1992). While
this definition is commonly cited, there are divergent views in
academic and policy circles on the concept and how to apply it
in practice (Banuri et al., 2001; Cocklin, 1995; Pezzoli, 1997;
Robinson and Herbert, 2001).
"	Text
"In light of this evolution, each chapter of this Fourth
Assessment Report focuses to some extent on the links to
sustainable development practices. Chapter 1 introduces the
concept, Chapter 2 provides a framework for understanding
the economic, environmental, and social dimensions, and
Chapter 3 addresses the issue of development choices for
climate change mitigation in a modelling context. The sector
Chapters 4 to 10 and the cross-sectoral Chapter 11 examine
the impacts of mitigation options on sustainable development
goals; and Chapter 13 describes the extent to which sustainable
development is addressed in international policies. Further, IPCC
(2007) devotes two chapters that are linked to the mitigation
discussion in this report. Chapter 17 in IPCC (2007) considers
adaptation practices, options, constraints and capacity, while
Chapter 18 examines the inter-relationships between adaptation
and mitigation. Finally, Chapter 20 contains discussions of
adaptation and sustainable development.

"The discussion on sustainable development in the IPCC
process has evolved since the First Assessment Report
which focused on the technology and cost-effectiveness of
mitigation activities. This focus was broadened in the Second
Assessment Report (SAR) to include issues related to equity,
both procedural and consequential, and across countries and
generations, and to environmental (Hourcade et al., 2001) and
social considerations (IPCC, 1996). The Third Assessment
Report (TAR) further broadened the treatment of sustainable
development by addressing issues related to global sustainability
(IPCC, 2001b, Chapter 1). The report noted three broad classes
of analyses or perspectives: efficiency and cost-effectiveness;
equity and sustainable development; and global sustainability
and societal learning. The preparation of TAR was supported by
IPCC Expert Group Meetings specially targeted at sustainable
development and social dimensions of climate change. These
groups noted the various ways that the TAR treatment of
sustainable development could be improved (Munasinghe and

The climate change and climate change impact scenarios assessed in the Fourth Assessment Report are primarily based on the SRES family of emission scenarios. These
define a spectrum of development paths, each with associated socio-economic and technological conditions and driving forces. Each family of emission scenarios will, there-
fore, give rise to a different set of response capacities.

Development paths are defined here as a complex array of technological, economic, social, institutional, cultural, and biophysical characteristics that determines the
interactions between human and natural systems, including consumption and production patterns in all countries, over time at a particular scale. In the TAR, “alternative
development paths” referred to a variety of possible development paths, including a continuation of current trends, but also a variety of other paths. To avoid confusion, the
word ‘alternative’ is avoided in the current report. Development paths will be different in scope and timing in different countries, and can be different for different regions within
countries with large differences in internal regional characteristics.
"	List
"Development paths underpin the baseline and stabilization
emissions scenarios discussed in Chapter 3 and are used to
estimate emissions, climate change and associated climate
change impacts!. For a development path? to be sustainable
over a long period, wealth, resources, and opportunity must be
shared so that all citizens have access to minimum standards
of security, human rights, and social benefits, such as food,
health, education, shelter, and opportunity for self-development
(Reed, 1996). This was also emphasized by the World Summit
on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg in 2002
which introduced the Water, Energy, Health, Agriculture, and
Biodiversity (WEHAB) framework.
"	Text
"Several strategies and measures that would advance
sustainable development would also enhance adaptive and
mitigative capacities. Winkler et al. (2006) have suggested that
mitigative capacity be defined as “a country’s ability to reduce
anthropogenic greenhouse gases or enhance natural sinks.”
There is a close connection between mitigative and adaptive
capacities and the underlying socio-economic and technological
development paths that give rise to those capacities. In
important respects, the determinants of these capacities are
critical characteristics of such development paths. For instance,
mitigative and adaptive capacities arise out of the more general
pool of resources called response capacity, which is strongly
affected by the nature of the development path in which it

"al., 2003; Wilbanks, 2003). The notion is that policies pursuing
sustainable development and climate change mitigation can
be mutually reinforcing. Much of this literature, as elaborated
upon in Chapters 4 to 11, emphasizes the degree to which
climate change mitigation can have effects. Sometimes called
ancillary benefits or co-benefits, these effects will contribute
to the sustainable development goals of the jurisdiction in
question. This amounts to viewing sustainable development
through a climate change lens. It leads to a strong focus on
integrating sustainable development goals and consequences
into the climate mitigation policy framework, and on assessing
the scope for such ancillary benefits. For instance, reductions
in GHG emissions might reduce the incidence of death and
illness due to air pollution and benefit ecosystem integrity, both
elements of sustainable development (Beg ef al., 2002). The
challenge then becomes ensuring that actions taken to address
global environmental problems help to address regional and
local development (Beg et al., 2002). Section 12.3 summarizes
the impacts of climate mitigation actions on economic, social
and environmental aspects of sustainable development noted in
Chapters 3 to 11, and 13.

"A key finding of the Third Assessment Report (TAR; IPCC,
2001b) is that through climate mitigation alone, it will be
extremely difficult and expensive to achieve low stabilization
targets (450 ppmv CO,) from baseline scenarios that embody
high emission development paths (also see Chapter 3). Low
emission baseline scenarios, however, may go a long way
toward achieving low stabilization levels even before climate
policy is included in the scenario (Morita et al., 2001) See
Section 3.1.2 for a discussion of the distinction between a
baseline and stabilization or mitigation scenario. Achieving low
emission baseline scenarios consistent with other principles of
sustainable development, that is viewing climate change through
a sustainable development lens, would illustrate the significant
contribution sustainable development can make to stabilization
(Metz et al., 2002; Winkler et al., 2002a; Davidson et al., 2003;
Heller and Shukla, 2003; Shukla et a/., 2003; Swart et al., 2003;
Robinson and Bradley, 2006). Section 12.2 focuses on this
critical question of the link between sustainable development
and ways to mainstream climate change mitigation into
sustainable development actions. This is a central element since
this topic is not addressed elsewhere in the Fourth Assessment
Report in a similarly comprehensive manner that is accessible
to a non-climate readership.

participation in development processes and decision-making,

"As noted in Chapter 2, the term ‘sustainable development,’
has given rise to considerable debate and concerns (Robinson,
2004). First, the variety of definitions of sustainable development
(Meadowcroft, 1997; Pezzoli, 1997; Mebratu, 1998) has
raised concerns about definitional ambiguity or vagueness. In
response, it has been argued that this vagueness may constitute
a form of constructive ambiguity that allows different interests
to engage in the debate, and the concept to be further refined
through implementation (Banuri and Najam, 2002; Robinson,
2004). The concept of sustainable development is not unique
in this respect, since its conceptual vagueness bears similarities
to other norm-based meta-objectives such as ‘democracy,’
‘freedom,’ and ‘justice’ (Lafferty, 1996; Meadowcroft, 2000).

Najam et al., 2003). The environment-poverty nexus is now well
recognized and the linkage between sustainable development and
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
has been clearly articulated (Jahan and Umana, 2003). While
the challenge of sustainable development is a common one,
countries have to adopt different strategies to advance sustainable
development goals — especially in the context of achieving the
MDGs (Dalal-Clayton, 2003). The paths they adopt will have
important implications for the mitigation of climate change (for a
more extensive discussion of MDGs, see Section 2.1.6). As noted
in Section 4.5.4.4 and Section 6.6, consideration of clean energy
services, even though not explicitly mentioned in the MDGs, will
be a vital factor in achieving both sustainable development and
climate mitigation goals.

"Finally, the most serious concern about sustainable
development is that it is inherently delusory. Some critics have
argued that because biophysical limits constrain the amount of
future development that is sustainable, the term ‘sustainable
development’ is itself an oxymoron (Dovers and Handmer,
1993; Mebratu, 1998; Sachs, 1999). This leads some to argue
for a ‘strong sustainability’ approach in which natural capital
must be preserved since it cannot be substituted by any other
form of capital (Pearce et al., 1989; Cabeza Gutes, 1996).
Others point out that the concept of sustainable development
is anthropocentric, thereby avoiding reformulation of values
that may be required to pursue true sustainability (Suzuki and
McConnell, 1997). While very different in approach and focus,
both these criticisms raise fundamental value questions that go
to the heart of present debates about environmental and social
issues.
"	Text
"However, discourses of sustainable development have
historically focused primarily on the environmental and
economic dimensions (Barnett, 2001), while overlooking the
need for social, political and/or cultural change (Barnett, 2001;
Lehtonen, 2004; Robinson, 2004). As Lehtonen (2004) explains,
however, most models of sustainable development conceive of
social, environmental (and economic) issues as ‘independent
elements that can be treated, at least analytically, as separate
from each-other’ (p. 201). The importance of social, political and
cultural factors, for example, poverty, social equity, governance,
is only now getting more recognition. In particular, there is a
growing recognition of the importance of the institutional and
governance dimensions (Banuri and Najam, 2002). From a
climate change perspective, this integration is essential in order
to define sustainable development paths. Moreover, as discussed
in this chapter, understanding the institutional context in which
policies are made and implemented is critical.

"The principles of sustainable development have progressively
been internalized in various national and international legal
instruments (Boyle and Freestone, 1999; Decleris, 2000). Law
contributes to the process of defining the concept of sustainable
development through both international (treaty) law and national
law. At a national level, principles of sustainable development
are being implemented in various regions and countries,
including New Zealand and the European Union. For example,
New Zealand’s Resource Management Act 1991 requires all
decisions under the Act to consider and provide for sustainable
management of natural and physical resources (Furuseth
and Cocklin, 1995). South Africa’s National Environmental
Management Act provides for the development of assessment
procedures that aim to ensure that environmental consequences
of policies, plans and programmes are considered (RSA, 1998).
India’s Planning Commission makes sustainability part of the
approach to providing ‘Clean Water for All’, noting that this
requires a shift from groundwater to surface water where
possible, or groundwater recharge (Government of India,
2006). Similarly, the 2000 EC Water Framework Directive is
seeking to operationalize principles of sustainable use in the
management of EU waters (Rieu-Clarke, 2004).

the resources approach, which concentrates on sustainable
use of natural resources and ignores development issues: (3)
a human approach based on human wellbeing, basic needs;
and (4) the norms approach, which foresees sustainable
development in normative terms. Each approach has its own
merits and weaknesses. Despite these efforts at measuring
sustainability, few offer an integrated approach to measuring
environmental, economic and social parameters (Corson, 1996;
Farsari and Prastacos, 2002; Swanson et al., 2004). This review
of indicators illustrates a significant gap in macro-indicators in
that few include measures of progress with respect to climate

"Various alternative approaches to estimate macro progress
towards sustainable development have been developed. Many
of these approaches integrate, though not necessarily focus
on, aspects of climate change. One approach to indicator
development focused on monetary measures and involves
adjustment to the GDP. These include, for example, calculation
of genuine savings (Hamilton and ef al., 1997; Pearce, 2000),
Sustainable National Income (Hueting, 1993), and efforts to
develop a measure of sustainability (Yohe and Moss, 2000). In
an attempt to aggregate and express resource consumption and
human impact in the context of a finite earth, a number of indices
based on non-monetary, physical measures were created. These
indices may be based on the concepts of environmental space

both absolute measures and efficiency measures may be useful.
But from the climate system perspective, it is ultimately

at international and national level have adopted a capital-based
framework following the above categories. They link indicators

paths” referred to a variety of possible development paths, including a continuation of current trends, but also a variety of other paths. To avoid confusion, the word ‘alternative’

the most significant sectors that shape emission profiles - energy,
industry, transportation and land use - are made by ministries
and companies that do not regularly attend to climate risks. The
same is true for even more indirect influences on these sectoral
pathways, including financial, macro-economic, and trade
practices and policies. The focus on development paths places
new emphasis on development’s impact on climate and on
indirect rather than direct actions that affect climate mitigation.

"Climate policy alone will not solve the climate problem.
Making development more sustainable by changing
development paths can make a major contribution to climate
goals. One of the major findings of TAR in terms of sustainable
development was that development choices matter (Banuri et

et al., 2002; Nakicenovic et al., 2000; Swart et al., 2003), and
especially the SRES Report (Morita et al., 2000), points to the
same conclusion. Climate outcomes are influenced not only by
climate specific policies but also by the mix of development
choices made and the development paths that these policies
lead to. There are always going to be a variety of development
pathways? that could possibly be followed and they might lead to
future outcomes at global, national, and local levels. The choice
of development policies can, therefore, be as consequential to
future climate stabilization as the choice of climate-specific
policies.

"The second segment of the road map suggests the importance
of better understanding in climate policy of how nations
organize sectoral and other emissions-determining policies and
behaviour. Section 12.2.3 assesses literature that analyze: (1)
the particular institutions, organizations, and political cultures
that form the installed systems of decision-making and priority-
setting from which decisions about key sectors or contexts
emerge; and (2) the broader trans-national trends that are
reshaping established governance processes. The description of
these installed systems and the ways in which they are changing
is drawn from an assessment of the social science literature on
relationships between states, markets and civil society. Thus,
Section 12.2.3 broadens the discourse beyond the economics
and technological literature now familiar in climate analysis
by incorporating history, political economy, and organization
theory. The emphasis moves from government to governance.
Rather than focusing on action by governments or states alone,
the social science literature suggests more attention on decisions
by multiple actors (Rayner and Malone, 1998; Jochem et al.,
2001). In some systems, change occurs primarily through actions
initiated by either central governments or more federalized local
jurisdictions. In others, it proceeds more through initiatives by
private organizations that are then complemented by supportive

with respect to health care, leading to a wide variety of different

developing countries (Redclift and Benton, 2006). But in
general, the chosen strategies have in common that they have
contributed to marked health improvements in almost all
regions. Advances have been uneven and improvements are
under constant pressure from new developments (e.g., AIDS,
new infectious diseases). In general, the health example suggests
that human choice can make a positive contribution towards
reaching a common goal (Frenk ef al., 1993; Smith, 1997).
The same could be true for sustainable development in general,

"Development policies not explicitly targeting GHG emissions
can influence these emissions in a major way. For example,
six developing countries (Brazil, China, India, Mexico, South
Africa, and Turkey) have avoided through development
policy decisions approximately 300 million tons a year of
carbon emissions over the past three decades. Many of these
efforts were motivated by common drivers, such as economic
development and poverty alleviation, energy security, and local
environmental protection (Chandler ef a/., 2002).The current
state of knowledge does not allow easy quantitative attribution
to specific policies with accuracy, given that other factors (as
in any country) also influence these emissions. For example,
autonomous technological modernization certainly has played
a role. Chandler et al. (2002), however, also clearly identify
policies that have made a definite contribution. In Brazil,
these included production and use of ethanol and sugarcane
bagasse, development of the natural gas industrial market,
use of alternative energy sources for power generation and a
set of demand-side programmes promoting conservation and
efficiency in the electricity and transportation sectors (See also

"Developing countries do not have to follow the example of
developed countries in terms of energy use (UNCSD, 2006),
since the early stages of infrastructure development offer
opportunities to satisfy their populations’ needs in different
ways. Many factors that determine a country’s or region’s
development pathway, and, closely related, its energy and
GHG emissions are subject to human intervention. Such
factors include economic structure, technology, geographical
distribution of activities, consumption patterns, urban design
and transport infrastructure, demography, institutional
arrangements and trade patterns. The later choices with respect
to these factors are made, the fewer opportunities there will be
to change development paths, because of lock-in effects (e.g.,
Arthur, 1989). For detailed discussion, see Section 2.7.1 and
Section 3.1.3. An assessment of mitigation options should not
be limited to technology, although this is certainly a key factor,
but should also cover the broader policy agenda. Climate change
mitigation can be pursued by specific policies, by coordinating
such policies with other policies and integrating them into
these other policies. Also, climate mitigation objectives can
be mainstreamed into general development choices, by taking
climate mitigation objectives routinely into consideration in the
pursuance of particular development pathways.

to lower growth in GHG emissions include restructuring the

"more severe than for OECD countries. This is because their
economies are more dependent on imported oil and more
energy-intensive, and because energy is used less efficiently.
On average, oil-importing developing countries use more than
twice as much oil to produce a unit of economic output as do
OECD countries. Developing countries are also less able to
weather the financial turmoil wrought by higher oil-import
costs (IEA, 2004a). For a discussion of the role of energy
security for development paths, see Section 3.3.6. Some studies
have shown that, depending on how priorities are set, some
conflict between local atmospheric pollution problems and
global climate change issues may arise. This is because some
of the most cost-effective, environmentally-friendly power
generation technologies for the global environment available
in developing countries, such as biomass-fired or even some
hydroelectric power plants, may not be sound for the local
environment (due to NO, and particulate emissions in the former
case, and flooding in the latter). Conversely, abating local air
pollution generally is beneficial from a global perspective. Still,
there are a few exceptions. Decreasing sulphur and aerosol
emissions (with the exception of black carbon) to address local
air pollution problems can increase overall radiative forcing,
because these aerosols have a negative radiative forcing. Thus,
exploring development paths requires careful assessment of
both local environmental priorities and global environmental
concerns (Schaeffer and Szklo, 2001).

"In the field of energy, experience with policies advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy use confirm that, although
developing countries need to increase their energy consumption in order to fuel their social and economic development,
it is possible to do so in a cleaner and more sustainable manner. These policy choices can have a significant impact on
energy trends, social progress and environmental quality in developing countries (Holliday et a/., 2002; Anderson, 2004;
Geller et al., 2004). In Brazil, programmes and measures have been undertaken over the past two or three decades in order to
mitigate economic and environmental problems. These have included not only improvements in the energy supply and demand
side management, but also specific tax incentive policies encouraging the production of cheap, small-engine automobiles
(<1000 cc) to allow industry to increase production (and create more jobs while increasing profits) and to make cars more
accessible to lower-income sectors of the population. These policies have led to lower carbon dioxide emissions than would
otherwise have been the case. Results of these programmes and measures show that, in 2000 alone, some 11% in CO,
emissions from energy use in Brazil have been reduced compared to what would have been emitted that year, had previous
policy decisions not been implemented. Interestingly, although these actions were not motivated by a desire to curb global
climate change, if the inherent benefits related to carbon emissions are not fully appraised in the near future, there is a chance
that such ‘win-win’ policies may not be pursued and may even be discontinued (Anderson, 2004; Szklo et al., 2005).

"The connections between development pathways and
international trade are often left unexplored. International trade
allows a country to partially ‘de-link’ its domestic economic
systems from its domestic ecological systems, as some goods
can be produced by other economic systems. In such cases,
the impacts of producing goods impact the ecological systems
of the exporting country (where production takes place)
rather than the ecological system of the importing country
(where consumption occurs). One popular way of showing
that the impacts of economic activities in many nations affect
an area much larger than within their national boundaries is
the ecological footprint (see Section 12.1.3). For example,
the environmental effects of soya and hardwood production
for export as fodder and construction material, respectively,
are well-known examples. As a consequence, in discussing
the implications of development choices for climate change
mitigation, it is not enough to discuss development pathways

different development pathways, but without explicitly

Four scenarios developed by the US National Intelligence

"As noted in Section 12.1.1, the mitigative capacity of a nation
is closely related to its underlying development path, which
depends on the general pool of resources that may be referred to
as response capacity. The response capacity including mitigative
capacity of countries varies, amongst other factors, with their
ability to pay for abatement costs. Winkler et al. (2007) analysed
the mitigative capacity of different countries as shaped by two
economic factors: namely average abatement cost (or mitigation
potential; high cost means low potential); and ability to pay, as
approximated by GDP per capita. Ability to pay, measured by
GDP per capita, is an important factor in mitigative capacity,
since more wealth gives countries greater capacity to reduce
emissions. The cost of abatement can act as a barrier in turning
mitigative capacity into actual mitigation. Examining these
factors together, Winkler et a/. (2007) found that the abatement
costs are not linearly correlated with level of income. Some
countries have high mitigative capacity (income) and are also
able to translate this into actual mitigation due to low costs.
For others, mitigative capacity is clearly low. Relatively high
average abatement costs mean that this capacity can be turned
into even less actual mitigation. Interestingly, there are some
poorer countries with low abatement costs. Conversely, there are
also countries with high mitigative capacity, as approximated
by income, but high average abatement costs. However, this
group of countries still has higher mitigative capacity, simply
by virtue of their higher ability to pay. Low-income countries
do not spend on mitigation even if they have low-cost mitigation
opportunities, simply because the opportunity cost in terms of
basic development needs is too high.

structural shift towards low carbon-intensity sectors; increased
environmental awareness with income, policy or technology
thresholds; and increasing returns to abatement (Copeland and
Taylor, 2004). The EKC hypothesis was initially formulated for
local pollutants in the seminal analysis of Grossman and Krueger
(1991) but was quickly expanded to CO, emissions. Even so, it
recognized that some of the theoretical explanations for local
pollutants, namely that higher income individuals would be
more sensitive to environmental concerns, are less relevant for
GHGs that do not have local environmental or health impacts.
The EKC hypothesis has generated considerable research, and
the field is still very active. Recent summaries can be found in
Stern (2004), Copeland and Taylor (2004) or Dasgupta et al.
(2004). With regard to carbon dioxide, three conclusions can be
drawn, as discussed below.

"per capita CO, emissions would decrease as income increases

However, the reliability of these estimates has been challenged
recently on technical grounds. For a general discussion, see
Harbaugh et al. (2002) and Millimet et a/. (2003); and for a
critical review focusing on carbon dioxide, see Wagner and
Miiller-Fiirstenberg (2004). Two main points emerge from the
most recent reviews: (1) they cast doubt on the idea that the
EKC hypothesis could be validated based on existing data; (2)
they conclude that the relationship between GDP and emissions
data is less robust than previously thought.

"Third, including trade among the explanatory variables
of CO, emissions usually yield EKC curves peaking farther
in the future (Frankel and Rose, 2002), although there are
methodological issues associated with this approach (Heil and
Selden, 2001). Using trade-corrected emissions data for USA,
Aldy (2005) also shows that taking trade into accounts leads to
curves that peak much later. Neither taking trade into account
as anew explanatory variable nor correcting emissions for trade
effects, however, significantly increases the robustness of the
correlation between observed levels of GDP per capita and
observed emission levels.
"	Text
"Second, studies using time series at the country level find
less robust relationships between GDP per capita and CO,
emissions per capita. For example, Moomaw and Unruh (1997)
show that international oil price shocks, and not per capita GDP
growth, explain most of the variations in per capita emissions in
OECD countries. Similarly, Coondoo and Dinda (2002) find a
strong correlation between emissions and income in developed
countries and in Latin America, but a weaker correlation
in Africa and Asia. Recent work on the EKC (Dasgupta et
al., 2004) also shows that the relationship between GDP per
capita and pollution is not as rigid as it seems, and in fact,
mostly disappears when other explanatory variables, notably
governance, are introduced.

"Recognizing the difficulty and limitations of trying to
directly control their domestic economies in an increasingly
open and globalized economy, governments now try to pursue
economic growth through strategic policies. These policies
are designed to increase access to foreign markets, encourage
inward foreign investment, maintain national competitiveness,
and obtain favourable outcomes from trade agreements (Jessop,
1997). While some believe that globalization has made national
governments less powerful, others argue that rather than simply
eroding government power, globalization has changed the ways
in which governments operate and influence situations (Levi-
Faur, 2005). On environmental issues, a strong case has been
made for the need for government policy to ensure delivery
of environmental protection as a public good (e.g., Liverman,
1999; Haas et al., 1993; OECD, 2001; Ostrom ef al., 2002).

"To sum up, the econometric literature on the relationship
between GDP per capita and CO, emissions per capita does not
support an optimistic interpretation of the EKC hypothesis that
“the problem will take care of itself’ with economic growth.
The monotonically increasing relationship between economic
activity and CO, emissions emerging from the data does not
appear to be econometrically very robust, especially at country
level and at higher GDP per capita level. The pessimistic
interpretation of the literature findings that growth and CO,
emissions are irrevocably linked is not supported by the data.
There is apparently some degree of flexibility between economic
growth and CO, emissions. For example, CO, emissions from
fossil-fuel combustion in China remained essentially constant
between 1997 and 2001. This was despite a +30% growth in
GDP (IEA, 2004a) due to the combination of closing small-
scale, inefficient power plants, shift in industry ownership away
from the public sector, and introduction of energy efficiency and
environmental regulation (Streets et al., 2001; Wu et al., 2005).

"Over the past two decades, social scientists have observed
significant changes in the role of government in relation to social
and economic change. These include a shift from government
defined strictly by the nation state to a more inclusive concept
of governance that recognizes the contributions of various
levels of government (global, trans-national, regional, local)
as well as the roles of the private sector, non-governmental
actors, and civil society (Rhodes, 1996; Goodwin, 1998).
The emergence of these new forms of governance has been
attributed to the need for new institutions to address the more
complex problems of present-day society, among which global
environmental risks figure prominently (Beck, 1992; Giddens,
1998; Howes, 2005). Ideology and economic globalization
have also played a role in the shifting focus from government
to governance. Command-and-control strategies are losing
favour while market-based mechanisms, voluntary initiatives,
and partnerships with non-governmental organizations have
gained wider acceptance (Lewis et al., 2002). However, the
shift to discussions of governance does not imply a reduction in
the role of government. Governments remain central actors in
environmental policy. They ensure the delivery of environmental
protection to citizens, and help create the rules, norms, and
many organizations that ensure environmental protection (Haas
et al., 1993; OECD, 2001; Ostrom et al., 2002).

"The impacts on climate change mitigation have been broadly scoped. If extended to all customers in a broad-based ap-

is likely that electricity might displace existing use of paraffin, coal, wood, candles, batteries and other fuels to some extent.
This upper-bound estimate represents 0.04% of total GHG emissions, but about 2% of residential sector emissions in 1994.

"Some companies have recognized that pursuing
sustainability offers potential cost savings (Thompson, 2002;

material efficiency in production and by reducing wastes,
companies can reduce costs per unit of production and thereby
gain a competitive market advantage (Hawken et al., 1999;
Schaltegger et al., 2003). This concept of ‘eco-efficiency’
further acknowledges that businesses which constantly work
to evaluate their environmental performance will be more
innovative and responsive businesses. DuPont, for example,
has sought to elevate sustainability to the strategic level, using a
three-pronged strategy involving integrated science, knowledge
intensity and productivity improvements (Holliday, 2001). The

forest preservation and carbon management. However, neither
country is able to allocate sufficient resources to monitoring and
compliance with those laws to ensure that they are effective.
Even in industrialized countries, competition for resources
among state agencies responsible for promoting economic
development and those responsible for environmental protection
are almost universally resolved in favour of the former. In much
of the developing world, the shortage of programmes resources

"Industry is a central player in ecological and sustainability
stewardship. Accordingly, over the past 25 years or so, there has
been a progressive increase in the number of companies taking
steps to address sustainability issues (Holliday et al., 2002; Lyon,

number of companies have, as part of their corporate strategy,
voluntarily defined goals that reflect social responsibilities and
environmental concerns that go beyond traditional company
obligations. Following this line of thinking, an increasing
number of companies are defining targets for GHG emissions
and sinks. Some of the more widely acknowledged corporate
sustainability drivers include regulatory compliance, market
opportunities, and reputational value. Lyon (2003) hypothesizes
that voluntary action on the environment might be explained by
either a recognition by companies that pollution is a symptom
of production inefficiencies, or a perception that consumers
are willing to pay more for products with better environmental
credentials. Either explanation would signal that markets are
more important than regulation as an incentive for improved
environmental performance. Lyon (2003) suggests instead

NGOs, improved relations can reduce or eliminate protests,
such as consumer boycotts and direct lobbying (Thompson,

social performance in response to demands from their corporate
clients. Many large corporations, in particular, have introduced

elements of its sustainability strategy, including reduction in raw material use and recycling materials not directly related to

sustainability reports. Similarly, CSR would seem to have
become a more serious concern to European companies,
though Pharaoh (2003) suggests it is primarily sales driven. In
the UK, socially responsible investment (Srivastava and Heller,
2003) grew from US$ 46 billion in 1997 to US$ 450 billion
in 2001 (Sparkes, 2002). Borsky et al. (2006) report that the
US$ 2.16 trillion of socially responsible investments held in the
USA accounted for approximately 11% of the total investment
assets under management in 2003. The standards used by SRI
funds to evaluate firms vary widely in the issues they address
(with many simply staying away from weapons, tobacco,
alcohol, and gambling) and how rigorously these standards are
applied. Some SRI companies emphasize diversity and labour
relations, while others focus on environment. There is no set of
common criteria, and thus not all companies on SRI lists can
be considered sustainable. However, growing public interest in
SRI has led more companies to be concerned about a variety of

"In considering the role of business, a distinction between
multinationals and smaller, entrepreneurial enterprises is useful.
A recent UK report identifies a difference in perspectives and
approaches to global climate change in these two groups
of businesses, with multinationals taking a long-term view,
positioning for the future based on broad policy directions
(Hamilton and Kenber, 2006). By contrast, smaller businesses,
entrepreneurs or venture capitalists are more sensitive to the
details of immediate or shorter term policy reforms. Similarly,
there may be a difference even within the multinational sector
between the energy suppliers (e.g., electricity producers/
distributors, oil companies, or even coal companies) and energy
intensive industries (e.g., chemical or aluminium companies).
The former takes a longer term, market development or pro-
active view and the later a more reactive view (e.g., BIAC/
OECD/IEA, 1999). Finally, some companies are likely to be
‘winners’ with any effort to advance sustainable development
through clean energy policies (e.g., insulation industry, window
manufacturers, energy service companies) and some are likely
to be ‘losers’ (e.g., producers of energy inefficient products). It
is therefore difficult to speak about ‘market’ sector preferences

how ‘epistemic’ or knowledge communities can directly add
to or ‘pull’ the global climate policy debate (Siebenhuner,
2002; Najam and Cleveland, 2003). In addition, the knowledge
communities as well as NGOs have been extremely active and
instrumental in servicing the needs of national and sub-national
climate policy. This is done in various ways: by universities and
research institutions writing local and national climate change
plans; by NGOs helping in the preparation of national climate
change positions for international negotiations and increasingly

"The image of civil society ‘pushing’ for environmental
protection and climate change mitigation policies is the most
familiar one. There are numerous examples of civil society
organizations and movements seeking to push policy reform
at the global, national and even local levels. The reform
desired by various interest groups within civil society can
differ (Michaelowa, 1998). But common to all is the legitimate
role civil society has in articulating and seeking their visions
of change through a multitude of mechanisms that include
public advocacy, voter education, lobbying decision-makers,
research, and public protests. Given the nature of the issue, civil
society includes not only NGOs but also academic and other
non-governmental research institutions, business groups, and
broadly stated the ‘epistemic’ or knowledge communities that
work on better understanding of the climate change problematic.
Some have argued that civil society has been the critical
element in putting global climate change into the policy arena
and relentlessly advocating its importance. Governments have
eventually began responding to these calls from civil society for
systematic environmental protection and global climate change

doubt that NGOs can be effective in shaping development

civil society in its various manifestations, seek to influence

have been particularly active and often influential in shaping
societal debate and policy directions on this issue (Corell and
Betsill, 2001; Gough and Shackley, 2001; Newell, 2000).
The literature on the various ways in which civil society, and
especially NGOs, influence global environmental policy in
general and climate policy in particular, points out that civil
society employs ‘civic will’ to the policy discourse and that it
can motivate policy in three distinct but related ways (Banuri
and Najam, 2002). First, it can push policy reform through
awareness-raising, advocacy and agitation. Second, it can pull
policy action by filling the gaps and providing policy services
such as policy research, policy advice and, in a few cases, actual
policy development. Third, it can create spaces for champions
of reform within policy systems so that they can assume a
salience and create constituencies for change that could not be

infrastructure and services. There are various forms of PPPs. In the power generation sector, popular examples of PPPs are
Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) projects. Private partners (investors) provide the financing and technology, they build, and they
operate the power generation facility for a concessionary period of up to 35 years. During the concession, a government
partner provides the investor with ownership rights and gradually buys back the project by providing the developer with the
right to charge consumers a fee for its product. At the end of the concession period, the facility is transferred to government
ownership at no further cost to the government.

evaluate the impacts, these particular partnerships, represent
a larger trend in the last decade with a far greater level of
partnership activities between governments and NGOs, and
between government and business, and now increasingly all

investment environments such as that in developing countries, private partners require a range of onerous guarantees from
governments to reduce their investment risks over the life of the projects. These include take-or-pay guarantees where gov-
ernments commit to purchase a minimum level of production, guarantees to cover currency exchange risks, fuel supply price
guarantees, political risk guarantees to protect against government regulatory change. In the aftermath of the East Asian

that technical change has traditionally occurred in the context
of economic growth. Sustainable development, he suggests,
implies that “the problem ordering shifts subtly yet profoundly”,
which will establish new challenges in achieving “publicly
managed transitions towards environmentally sustainable
technological regimes” (Smith, 2003). In the context of climate

(2005) outline options for inducing innovation under different
governance paradigms — the top-down, command-and-control
approach (state) a market model, or through policy networks
(processes, interactions, networks). Geels (2004) and Smith
(2003) approach the same question from a different perspective,
both concluding that radical innovations are nurtured in ‘niches’.
Thus: “Climate change, for instance, is currently putting

in which the emission-producing sectors are directly controlled
by governments, public policies are only one of many incentives
that decision-makers react to (see also Section 12.2.3). Third,

communities (Hajer, 1995; SLG, 2001; Fisher, 2004). How
this plays out will, to some extent, be influenced by different
cultural and social biases in governance at the domestic level
(e.g., whether science and business have a privileged role in
the policy process; the access and influence of environmental
organizations; how coalitions of actors across these groups
interact with the policy process). On issues of global
environmental change, scientists and other experts necessarily
play a privileged role to advise governments (Jasanoff, 1990;

emissions per unit of energy consumed might decrease,
depending on the relative carbon content of the fuel used in
the baseline (typically kerosene) and of the electricity newly

a strong influence on this technology choice. In some cases, the

"Liberalization: Many countries have embarked on
liberalization of their energy sector over the past two decades.
These programmes with the objective to reduce costs and
improve efficiency of energy services include privatization
of the energy producers, separation between production and
transmission activities, liberalization of energy markets, and
lifting restrictions on capital flows in the sector. Overall,
liberalization programmes aim at improving the efficiency of the
energy sector, and should, therefore, lead to reduced emissions
per unit of output. Effective privatization programmes, however,
differ markedly from country to country (Kessides, 2004),
depending on prior institutional arrangements. In addition,
privatization programmes are often sequentia. See, for example,
Jannuzzi (2005) for a discussion on how the Brazilian regulator
progressively adapted policies to elicit sufficient resources for
energy efficiency and R&D from private utilities. These policies
are often ‘incomplete’, in the sense that former public power
generators remain dominant by combining features from both
the public and private sector, an outcome very different from the
ideal private energy markets (Victor and Heller, 2007: see also

is little literature drawing general lessons on the implications of
privatization programmes on GHG emissions.

"Access to Energy: Access to energy is critical for the
provision of basic services such as lighting, cooking,
refrigeration, telecommunication, education, transportation
or mechanical power (Najam et al., 2003). Yet, an estimated
2.4 billion people rely on wood, charcoal or dung for cooking,
and 1.6 billion are without access to electricity IEA, 2004c).
Providing access to commercial fuel and efficient stoves
would have highly positive impacts on human development
by reducing child mortality, improving maternal health, and
freeing up time used to collect fuel wood, especially for women
and girls (Najam and Cleveland, 2003; Modi et al., 2006). For
example, indoor air pollution, mainly from cooking and heating
from solid fuels, is responsible for 36% of all lower respiratory
infections and 22% of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(WHO, 2002). See also Chapter 4 and Chapter 6. It is estimated
that a shift from crop residues to LPG, kerosene, ethanol gel,
or biogas could decrease indoor air pollution by approximately
95% (Smith et al., 2000). The impact on GHG emissions
depends on the nature of the biomass resources and the carbon
intensity of the replacement. Providing reliable access to
electricity would also have highly positive impacts on human
development, by providing preconditions for the development
of new economic and social activities, for example, allowing
for education activities at night and employment generating

the direct efficiency gains might be offset by increased demand
due to lower energy costs per unit of output. Efficiency also
increases competitiveness, relaxes supply constraints and,
therefore, enhances the range of policy options and space,
and lowers expenditure on energy thereby freeing up more
resources for other development goals. The impact on CO,
emissions, in turn, tends to be positive, but depends heavily on
the carbon content of the energy supply. For example, Brazil

of the country’s total. DSM programmes are also discussed in
Section 6.8.3.1 and Section 5.5.1.Over the period 1973-1998,
the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2004b) estimates that
energy efficiency - driven both by policies and by autonomous
technical improvements - have resulted in energy savings
corresponding to almost 50% of 1998 energy consumption
levels. Without these savings, energy use (and CO, emissions)
in 1998 would have been almost 50% higher than observed.

"Energy Security: Energy security is broadly defined as
ensuring long-term security of energy supply at reasonable
prices to support the domestic economy. This is a major concern
for Governments worldwide, and it has taken new prominence
in recent years with the political instability in the Middle East,
increased oil prices, and tensions over gas in Europe (Dorian et
al., 2006; Turton and Barreto, 2006). Energy security concerns,
however, can translate into very different policies depending
on national and historical circumstances (Helm, 2002). Their
impact on carbon emissions is ambiguous, depending on the
nature of the policies and, in particular, on the fuel sources being
favoured. For example, in response to the first oil shock, Brazil
launched in 1975 the National Alcohol Fuel Program (PRO-
ALCOOL) to increase the production of sugarcane ethanol as
a substitute for oil, at a time when Brazil was importing about
80% of its oil supply>. The programmes resulted in reduction
of oil imports and expenditure of foreign currency and job
creation, as well as in large emission reductions, estimated at 1.5
Mt CO,/yr (Szklo et al., 2005). Brazil also provides an example
where emissions actually increased as a result of energy security
considerations. During the 1990s, Brazil faced lack of public
and private investment in the expansion of the power system
(both generation and transmission) and a growing supply-
demand imbalance, which culminated in electricity shortage
and rationing in 2001. This situation forced the country to install
and run emergency fossil-fuel plants, which led to a substantial
increase in GHG emissions from the power sector in 2001
(Geller et al., 2004). Hourcade and Kostopoulo (1994) show
how reactions to the first oil shock by France, Italy, Germany,
and Japan led to very different emissions with relatively similar
economic outcomes (see Box 12.5).

"A great deal of literature, however, deals with the emission
implications of some components of privatization programmes,
particularly removal of energy subsidies. Energy subsidies
removal may also be adopted as a stand-alone policy, independent
from privatization. Conversely, subsidies may remain even
within competitive markets. Government subsidies in the global
energy sector are in the order of US$ 250-300 billion per year,
of which around 2-3% support renewable energy (De Moor,
2001). Removing subsidies on energy has well-documented
economic benefits. It frees up financial resources for other uses
and discourages overuse of natural resources (UNEP, 2004). But,
reducing energy subsidies might have important distributional
effects, notably on the poor, if not accompanied by appropriate
compensation mechanisms. The impact of policies to reduce
energy subsidies on CO, emissions is expected to be positive
in most cases, as higher prices trigger lower demand for energy
and induce energy conservation. For example, econometric
analyses have shown that price liberalization in Eastern Europe
during the period 1992-1999 was an important driver of the
decrease in energy intensity in the industrial sector (Cornillie
and Fankhauser, 2002). Similarly, removal of energy subsidies
has been identified as instrumental in reducing GHG emissions
compared with the baseline in China and India over the past 20
years (Chandler et a/., 2002). Overall, an OECD study showed
global CO emissions could be reduced by more than 6% and
real income increased by 0.1% by 2010, if support mechanisms
on fossil fuels used by industry and the power generation
sector were removed (OECD, 2002). Yet subsidies removal
may actually result in increased emissions in cases where
poor consumers are forced off-grid and back to highly carbon
intensive fuels, such as non-sustainable charcoal or diesel
generators. For example, removal of the subsidies for LPG in
Senegal under the ‘butanization’ programmes discussed above
is expected to increase charcoal and unsustainable fuelwood use
(Deme, 2003). For additional discussion on energy subsidies,
see Section 4.5.1 and Section 6.8.3.2 and Section 13.2.1.5.

"Transportation is a key development issue. Transportation
is also one of the fastest growing end-use sectors in terms of
CO, emissions in both the developed and the developing world.
The level of these emissions results from the combination of
the distances travelled by goods and people, and the set of
technologies used to make these journeys. Demand for and
supply of transportation are largely inelastic in the short-term,
but become elastic in the longer run as people and activities
change location, as new infrastructure is developed and as
preferences evolve. A very wide array of policies affects these
long-term dynamics. The set of transportation technologies
available at time, and their relative costs, are also influenced by
public policies.

"ultimately emissions from the transport sector are discussed in
this section: one of congestion policy, one of urban planning
at city level, and the other of national policy driving urban
planning. The first example is from the City of London,
where a congestion charge was introduced in February 2003
to reduce congestion. Simultaneously, investment in public
transport was increased. Early results suggest that congestion
in the charging zone has reduced by 30% during the charging
hours, that CO, emissions have been reduced by 20%, and that
primary emissions of NO, and PM, have been reduced by 16%
(Transport for London, 2005). However, the cost-benefit ratio of
the operation is questioned (Prud’homme and Bocarejo, 2005;
Santos and Fraser, 2006). Other examples of how non-climate

"An example of how different development paths can unfold in relatively similar countries is given by Hourcade and Kostopou-

the first oil shock. France moved aggressively to develop domestic supply of nuclear energy and a new building code. Japan
made an aggressive shift of its industry towards less energy-intensive activities and simultaneously used its exchange-rate
policies to alleviate the burden of oil purchases. Germany built industrial exports to compensate the trade balance deficit
in the energy sector. Much of the variations of CO, emissions per unit of GDP from 1971 to 1990 can be attributed to these

choices (Figure 12.1 left). Yet, while this indicator diminished by half in France, by a third in Japan, and ‘only’ by a quarter in

1997 to 2001 (in intervention prices, in per-hectare support to

of Mato Grosso — triggered massive increase in production and
massive deforestation of cerrado forests. In fact, a third of total

extremely large (see Chapter 9). In addition, emissions/uptake

of forest products in carbon stocks, and to bioenergy are very
large. Policies affecting land use and land-use change, policies
affecting the substitution between wood-based and other

"The causes of deforestation have been studied specifically.
They differ from regions to regions and depend on the interaction
of cultural, demographic, economic, technological, political and
institutional issues (e.g., Angelsen and Kaimowitz, 1999; Geist
and Lambim, 2002). In all cases, the drivers of deforestation
are strongly affected by policy decisions. For example, rural
road construction or improvement tend to encourage future
deforestation (Chomitz and Gray, 1996; Chomitz, 2007), yet
may have positive economic implications by providing better
access to markets and basic services for remote population
in developing countries (Jacoby, 2000). Similarly, agriculture
intensification policies have potentially important but ambiguous
effects on deforestation. On the one hand, intensification
increases the productivity of existing agricultural land and
lowers the pressure on forests. On the other, it could also trigger
migration and it might, in fact, increase deforestation. Careful
design of agriculture intensification policies is thus necessary
to avoid unintended outcome on deforestation (Angelsen and
Kaimowitz, 2001).

"The third example concerns urban planning in the United
States and Europe (and Japan), the latter being on average
rather compact while the former exhibit important sprawl.
Nivola (1999) notes that this difference cannot be explained
only by differences in demography, geography, technology or
income. He argues that the combination of public choices is
responsible for most of the differences in urban sprawl between
the USA and Europe. Such policies include: (1) a bias towards
public financing of roads to the detriment of other modes of
transportation in the USA - against a more balanced approach in
Europe; (2) dedicated revenues for highway construction in the
USA - against funds drawn from general revenues in Europe; (3)
lower taxes on gasoline in the USA than in Europe; (4) housing
policies more geared towards supporting new homes: (5) a tax
system more in favour of homeowners in the USA; (6) lower
support from the federal government to local governments in the
USA than in Europe; and (7) the quasi-absence of regulations
favouring small in-city outlets against shopping malls in the
USA. In turn, this difference in urban planning generates widely
different transport demand, energy consumption (Newman
and Kenworthy, 1991), and CO, emissions. Per capita CO,
emissions from travel in the USA are nearly three times as high
as in major European countries, due mostly to a larger number
of journeys per capita and a higher energy intensity (Schipper
et al., 2001). A key point in the analysis made by Nivola (1999)
is that most of these consequences were totally unintended, as
these policies were adopted for non-transportation reasons (let
alone for emissions reasons).

given available inputs — sectors that are closer to the production
frontier—also have opportunities to reduce emissions by meeting
other sustainable development goals. However, the closer to
the production frontier, the more trade-offs are likely to appear.
For example, as discussed above, diversifying energy supply
sources in a country where the energy system is already cost-
efficient might be desirable for energy security reasons and/or
for local or global environmental reasons. But it might come at
a cost to the country if, for example, diversification involves
more expensive technologies or more risky investments (Dorian

"Although the examples discussed above are very diverse,
some general patterns emerge. First, in any given country,
sectors where effective production is far below the maximum
feasible production with the same amount of inputs — sectors that
are far away from their production frontier — have opportunities
to adopt ‘win-win-win’ policies. Such policies free up resources
and bolster growth, meet other sustainable development goals,
and also, incidentally, reduce GHG emissions relative to
baseline. Among the examples discussed above, the removal of
energy subsidies in economies in transition, or the mitigation of
urban pollution in highly polluted cities in the developing world
pertain to the ‘win-win-win’ category. Of course, these policies
may have winners and losers, but compensation mechanisms
can be designed to make no-one worse off in the process.

"1990. At the other end, Machado et al. (2001) report that inflows
and outflows of carbon embodied in the international trade of
non-energy goods in Brazil accounted for some 10% and 14%,
respectively, of the total carbon emissions from energy use of the
Brazilian economy in 1995. And the game is often not zero-sum,
when production technologies are less carbon-efficient in the
exporting country than in the importing one. For example, Shui
and Harriss (2006) estimate that USA-China trade represents
between 7% and 14% of China’s total CO, emissions, and that
USA-China trade increases world emissions by an average of
100 MtCO,-eq per year over the period 1997-2003 because
of higher emissions per kWh and less efficient manufacturing
technologies in China. Finally, policies favourable to trade
have been accused of favouring the relocation of companies to
‘pollution heavens’ where environmental constraint would be
lower. Empirical analysis, however, do not confirm the ‘race to
the bottom’ hypothesis (Wheeler, 2001). See also Section 11.7.

"Among macro-economic policies, trade policies have
attracted particular attention in recent years, due to the fact
that international trade has increased dramatically over the
past decades. There is a general consensus that, in the long-
run, openness to trade is beneficial for economic growth.
However, the pace of openness, and how to cope with social
consequences of trade policies are subject to much controversy
(Winters et al., 2004). Trade has multiple implications for GHG
emissions. First, increased demand for transportation of goods
and people generates emissions. For example, freight transport
now represents more than a third of the total energy use in the
transportation sector (see Section 5.2.1). Secondly, trade allows
countries to partially ‘de-link’ consumption from emissions,
since some goods and services are produced abroad, with
opposite implications for the importing and exporting countries.

German goods accounts for nearly a third of the observed

"are designed for other purposes. This link has been extensively
studied in the past decades, notably in the context of the evaluation
of structural adjustment programmes in developing countries. A
key finding from this literature is that the relationship between
macro-economic policies and the environment are often
complex and country-specific, and depend on whether or not
other market or institutional imperfections persist (Munasinghe
and Cruz, 1995; Gueorguieva and Bolt, 2003). No case studies
discuss the impact of structural adjustment on GHG emissions,
but some discuss the relationship between structural adjustment
and deforestation and thus, by extension, GHG emissions from
land-use change. Again, the effects depend on the mix of policies
adopted as part of the structural adjustment programmes, and
of country-specific characteristics. For example, Kaimovitz
et al. (1999) report that the structural adjustment programmes
implemented in Bolivia in 1985 strongly increased profitability
of soybean production, and led to massive deforestation in
soybean producing areas. Symmetrically, Benhin and Barbier
(2004) find thata structural adjustment programmes implemented
in Ghana in 1983 led to a reduction of deforestation linked to
extension of cocoa culture because, among others, of increased
producer price for cocoa, higher availability of inputs, and other
measures aimed at rehabilitating existing cocoa farms. Another
channel through which structural adjustment programmes could
impact on deforestation is through the timber market. Pandey
and Wheeler (2001) analyse cross-country data on the markets
for wood products in countries where World Bank supported
adjustment programmes were implemented. They find that these
programmes greatly affect imports, exports, consumption and
production in many forest product sectors, but that the impacts
on deforestation tend to cancel out. If domestic deforestation
does not increase, however, imports of wood products do,
suggesting increased pressures on forest in other countries.
Finally, as also noted above, Pandey and Wheeler (2001) find
that currency devaluation strongly increases the exploitation of
forest resources.

however. These emissions are estimated to be between
10% and 15% of developing-country residential sector

areas of developing countries rely primarily on traditional

oil and other energy carriers is an approach adopted by
countries concerned about energy security. The percentage
of net oil imports serves as one indicator of a country’s
energy security. The CO, emissions associated with net oil
imports amounted to about 20% of global emissions (see
Table 12.3). Reducing oil imports as a strategy to improve
energy security thus offers a significant global opportunity to
reduce emissions. Minimizing the use of coal as a substitute,
and increasing use of less-carbon-intensive energy sources
and reducing energy intensity of the economy are options
that could be pursued to achieve this goal (IEA, 2004b).
However, heavy use of biomass as a fossil fuel substitute
may compete with other societal goals such as food security,
alleviation of hunger and conservation of biodiversity.

"Emissions that key stakeholders can influence:
International finance: While climate change mitigation is
an important component of the multilateral bank (MDB)
strategies, in practice climate change issues are not
systematically incorporated into lending forall sectors. MDBs
could explicitly integrate climate change considerations into
their guidelines for country and sector strategies, and apply
a greenhouse gas accounting framework in their operations
(Sohn et al., 2005). MDBs can directly influence their own
lending and indirectly influence the emissions of borrowing
countries. The annual emissions from World Bank-funded
energy activities alone, for instance, were estimated to range
from 0.27 to 0.32 GtCO, (World Bank, 1999). MDBs could
directly influence more than the aforementioned amounts
once emissions associated with all lending activities of all
MDBs are counted. Indirectly, through policy dialogue and
conditionality, MDBs could influence additional emissions
from developing countries, which amounted to about 25%
of global emissions in 2004 (Table 12.3).

Insurance: Buildings and transport vehicles form the bulk
of the insured activities. Emissions from these sectors
and from all international marine vessels and aircraft are
estimated to be about 20% of global emissions, giving
insurers a significant potential role in controlling emissions.
Some insurers are beginning to recognize climate-change
risks to their business (Vellinga et al., 2001; Mills, 2005).
Examples of actions may include premiums differentiated
to reflect vehicle fuel economy (this is not unique to the
buildings and/or transport sector or distance driven); liability
insurance exclusions for large emitters; improved terms to
recognize the lower risks associated with green buildings; or
new insurance products to help manage technical, regulatory,

and financial risks associated with emissions trading (Mills,

"Some mitigation activities, particularly in the land use sector,
have GHG benefits that may be of limited duration. A finite
amount of land area is available for forestation, for instance,
which limits the amount of carbon that a region can sequester.
And, certain practices are carried out in rotation over years and/
or across landscapes, which too limit the equilibrium amount of
carbon that can be sequestered. Thus, the incremental sustainable
development gains would reach an equilibrium condition after

some decades, unless the land yields biofuel that is used as a
substitute for fossil fuels.
"	Text
"The sustainable development benefits of mitigation options
vary over sectors and regions. Generally, mitigation options that
improve productivity of resource use, whether it is energy, water,
or land, yield positive benefits across all three dimensions of
sustainable development. In the agricultural sector (Table 8.8),
for instance, improved management practices for rice cultivation
and grazing land, and use of bioenergy and efficient cooking
stoves enhance productivity, and promote social harmony and
gender equality. Other categories of mitigation options have a
more uncertain impact and depend on the wider socio-economic
context within which the option is being implemented.
"	Text
"As documented in the sectoral chapters, mitigation options
often have positive effects on aspects of sustainability, but may
not always be sustainable with respect to all three dimensions of
sustainable development - economic, environmental and social.
For example, removing subsidies for coal increases its price and
creates unemployment of coal mine workers, independently of
the actual mitigation (IPCC, 2001). In some cases, the positive
effects on sustainability are more indirect, because they are the
results of side-effects of reducing GHG emissions. Therefore, it
is not always possible to assess the net outcome of the various
effects.

"The sectoral discussion below focuses on the three aspects
of sustainable development - economic, environmental, and
social. Economic implications include costs and overall
welfare. Sectoral costs of various mitigation policies have
been widely studied and a range of cost estimates are reported
for each sector at both the global and country-specific levels
in the sectoral Chapters 4 to 10. Yet, mitigation costs are
just one part of the broader economic impacts of sustainable
development . Other impacts include growth and distribution of
income, employment and availability of jobs, government fiscal
budgets, and competitiveness of the economy or sector within
a globalizing market.

Energy Supply and Use: Chapters

4-7

 

Energy efficiency
improvement in all sectors
(buildings, transportation,
industry, and energy
supply: Chapters 4-7)

- Almost always cost-effective, reduces or eliminates local
pollutant emissions and consequent health impacts, improves
indoor comfort and reduces indoor noise level, creates business
opportunity and jobs, and improves energy security

- Government and industry programmes can help overcome lack of
information and principal agent problems

- Programmes can be implemented at all levels of government and
industry

- Important to ensure that low-income household energy needs are
given due consideration, and that the process and consequences
of implementing mitigation options are, or the result is, gender-
neutral

- Indoor air pollution and health impacts
of improving biomass cook stove thermal
efficiency in developing country rural areas
are uncertain

 

Fuel switching and
other options in the
transportation and
buildings sectors
(Chapters 5 and 6)

- CO, reduction costs may be offset by increased health benefits

- Promotion of public transport and non-motorized transport has
large and consistent social benefits

- Switching from solid fuels to modern fuels for cooking and
heating indoors can reduce indoor air pollution and increase free
time for women in developing countries

- Institutionalizing planning systems for CO, reduction through
coordination between national and local governments is important
for drawing up common strategies for sustainable transportation
systems

- Diesel engines are generally more fuel-
efficient than gasoline engines and thus
have lower CO, emissions, but increase
particle emissions

- Other measures (CNG buses, hybrid
diesel-electric buses and taxi renovation)
may provide little climate benefits

 

Replacing imported

fossil fuel with domestic
alternative energy sources
(DAES: Chapter 4)

- Important to ensure that DAES is cost-effective

- Reduces local air pollutant emissions.

- Can create new indigenous industries (e.g., Brazil ethanol
programme) and hence generate employment

- Balance of trade improvement is traded
off against increased capital required for
investment

- Fossil-fuel-exporting countries may face
reduced exports

- Hydropower plants may displace local
populations and cause environmental
damages to water bodies and biodiversity

 

Replacing domestic

fossil fuel with imported
alternative energy sources
(IAES: Chapter 4)

- Almost always reduces local pollutant emissions

- Implementation may be more rapid than DAES

- Important to ensure that IAES is cost-effective

- Economies and societies of energy-exporting countries would
benefit

- Could reduce energy security
- Balance of trade may worsen but capital
needs may decline

 

Forestry Sector: Chapter 9

 

Afforestation

- Can reduce wasteland, arrest soil degradation, and manage water
runoff

- Can retain soil carbon stocks if soil disturbance at planting and
harvesting is minimized

- Can be implemented as agro-forestry plantations that enhance
food production

- Can generate rural employment and create rural industry

- Clear delineation of property rights would expedite
implementation of forestation programmes

- Use of scarce land could compete with
agricultural land and diminish food security
while increasing food costs

- Monoculture plantations can reduce
biodiversity and are more vulnerable to
diseases

- Conversion of floodplain and wetland
could hamper ecological functions

 

Avoided deforestation

- Can retain biodiversity, water and soil management benefits, and
local rainfall patterns

- Reduce local haze and air pollution from forest fires

- If suitably managed, it can bring revenue from ecotourism and
from sustainably harvested timber sales

- Successful implementation requires involving local dwellers in
land management and/or providing them alternative livelihoods,
enforcing laws to prevent migrants from encroaching on forest
land

- Can result in loss of economic welfare for
certain stakeholders in forest exploitation
(land owners, migrant workers)

- Reduced timber supply may lead to
reduced timber exports and increased use
of GHG-intensive construction materials

- Can result in deforestation with consequent
sustainable development implications
elsewhere

 

 

Forest Management

- See afforestation

 

 

- Fertilizer application can increase NO
production and nitrate runoff degrading
local (ground)water quality

- Prevention of fires and pests has short
term benefits but can increase fuel stock
for later fires unless managed properly

options

Potential sustainable development synergies and conditions
for implementation

Potential sustainable development trade-
offs

 

Bioenergy (Chapter 8 and 9)

 

Bioenergy production

- Mostly positive when practised with crop residues (shells, husks,
bagasse, and/or tree trimmings)

- Creates rural employment

- Planting crops/trees exclusively for bioenergy requires that
adequate agricultural land and labour is available to avoid
competition with food production

- Can have negative environmental
consequences if practised unsustainably
- biodiversity loss, water resource
competition, increased use of fertilizer and
pesticides

- Potential problem with food security
(location specific) and increased food costs

 

Agriculture: Chapter 8

 

Cropland management
(management of nutrients,
tillage, residues, and agro-
forestry)

Cropland management
(water, rice, and set-aside)

- Improved nutrient management can improve ground water quality
and environmental health of the cultivated ecosystem

- Changes in water policies could lead
to clash of interests and threaten social
cohesiveness

- Could lead to water overuse

 

Grazing land management

- Improves livestock productivity, reduces desertification, and
provide social security to the poor
- Requires laws and enforcement to ban free grazing

 

Livestock management

- Mix of traditional rice cultivation and livestock management
would enhance incomes even in semi arid and arid regions

 

Waste Management: Chapter 10

 

Engineered sanitary
landfilling with landfill gas
recovery

- Can eliminate uncontrolled dumping and open burning of waste,
improving health and safety for workers and residents

- Sites can provide local energy benefits and public spaces
for recreation and other social purposes within the urban
infrastructure

- When done unsustainably can cause
leaching that leads to soil and groundwater
contamination with potentially negative
health impacts

 

Biological processes for
waste and wastewater
(composting, anaerobic
digestion, aerobic and
anaerobic wastewater
processes)

- Can destroy pathogens and provide useful soil amendments if
properly implemented using source-separated organic waste or
collected wastewater

- Can generate employment

- Anaerobic processes can provide energy benefits from CH,
recovery and use

- A source of odours and water pollution if
not properly controlled and monitored

 

Incineration and other
thermal processes

- Obtain the most energy benefit from waste

- Expensive relative to controlled landfilling
and composting

- Unsustainable in developing countries if
technical infrastructure not present

- Additional investment for air pollution
controls and source separation needed
to prevent emissions of heavy metals and
other air toxics

 

 

Recycling, reuse, and
waste minimization

 

- Provide local employment as well as reductions in energy and raw
materials for recycled products

- Can be aided by NGO efforts, private capital for recycling
industries, enforcement of environmental regulations, and urban
planning to segregate waste treatment and disposal activities
from community life.

 

- Uncontrolled waste scavenging results in
severe health and safety problems for those
who make their living from waste

- Development of local recycling industries
requires capital.

and social sustainable development goals are presented in Table
12.4. In the case of energy efficiency, it is generally thought to
be cost effective and its use reduces or eliminates local pollutant
emissions. Improving energy efficiency is thus a desirable
option in every energy demand and supply sector.

"In developing countries, efficient cooking stoves that use
clean biomass fuels are an important option. These can have
significant health benefits including reduction in eye diseases.
The incident is disproportionately high amongst rural women in
many developing countries where fuelwood and other biomass
materials are a principal source of energy (Porritt, 2005). It has
also been shown, for example, that the availability of cleaner
burning cookers and solar cookers in developing countries not
only has important health benefits but also significant social
benefit in the lives of women in particular (Dow and Dow, 1998).
A move to a more reliable and cleaner fuel not only has benefits
in terms of carbon emission and health, it has also the effect of
freeing up significant amount of time for women and children,
which can be applied to more socially beneficial activities,
including going to schools in the case of children. The air
pollution benefit of improved stoves, however, is controversial;
other studies have noted that efficiency was improved at the
expense of higher emissions of harmful pollutants (see Section
4.5.4.1).

"As noted in Section 12.1.3, over the last decade, quantification
of progress towards sustainable development has gained
ground. In the industrial sector, several trade associations
provide platforms for organizing and implementing GHG
mitigation programmes. Chapter 7 notes that performance
indicators are being used by the aluminium, semiconductor,
and cement industry to measure and report progress towards
sustainable development. The Global Reporting Initiative
(GRI), a UNEP Collaborating Centre initiative, for example,
reports that over 700 companies worldwide make voluntary
use of its Sustainability Reporting Guidelines for reporting
their sustainable development achievements. Industrial sectors
with high environmental impacts lead in reporting and 85%
of the reports address progress on climate change (GRI,
2005), and (KPMG Global Sustainability Services, 2005).
Another example is in the buildings sector. Several thousand
commercial buildings have been certified by the USA Green
Building Council’s programme on Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design (LEED), which uses 69 criteria to award
certificates at various levels of achievement. The certification
ensures that a building meets largely quantitative criteria related
to energy use, indoor air quality, materials and resource use,
water efficiency, and innovation and design process (USGBC,
2005). Economic and ethical considerations are the most cited
reasons by businesses in the use of these two guidelines.
"	Text
"In the transport sector, the energy efficiency measures may
be categorized into those that are vehicle specific and those that
address transportation planning. Vehicle-specific programmes
focus on improvement to the technology and vehicle operations.
Planning programmes are targeted to street layouts, pavement
improvements, lane segregation, and infrastructural measures
that improve vehicle movement and facilitate walking, biking
and the use of mass transport. Cost-effective mitigation
measures of both types have been identified that result in higher
vehicle and/or trip fuel economy and reduce local air pollution.
Institutionalizing planning systems for CO, reduction through
coordinated interaction between national and local governments
is important for drawing up common strategies for sustainable
transportation systems (see Section 5.5.1). While there are
many synergies in emission controls for air pollution and
climate change, there are also trade-offs (see Section 5.5.4).
Promotion of bicycling, walking, and other non-motorized
modes of transportation has large and consistent co-benefits
of GHG reduction, air quality, and people health improvement
(see Section 5.2.1 and 5.5.4). Diesel engines are generally more
fuel efficient than gasoline engines and thus have lower CO,
emissions, but increase particle emissions. Air quality driven
measures, such as obligatory particle matter and NO, filters
and in-engine measures, mostly result in higher fuel use and
consequently, higher GHG emissions.

among pollutants are inevitable in the use of some mitigation
options, and need to be resolved in the specific context in which
the option is to be implemented.

"At the same time, low carbon fuels can have other
environmental benefits. For example, a move away from coal
to cleaner fuels will reduce ecosystem pressures that often
accompany mining operations (Azapagic, 2004). Similarly, a
move away from charcoal and fuelwood as a source of energy
will have the attendant environmental benefits of reducing the
pressures of deforestation (Masera et al., 2000; Najam and
Cleveland, 2003). This points towards the need to optimize
technology choice decisions not only along the dimension of
carbon emissions but also other environmental costs.

"Since energy efficiency improvement reduces reliance on
energy supply, it is likely to improve a nation’s energy security.
Using prices as an instrument to promote energy efficiency
mitigation options is often difficult due to the many barriers that
impede their progress. Lack of information about such mitigation
options and the principal agent problem have been documented
to be particularly significant barriers in the residential sector,
but these also prevail in the small and medium scale industries
sectors (Sathaye and Murtishaw, 2005). Programmes. that
can overcome such barriers would increase energy efficiency
penetration.

"Switching to low carbon energy supply sources is the other
mitigation category in the energy sector with significant GHG
benefits. This can be achieved through either increased reliance
on imported or indigenous alternative fuels. Using a higher
proportion of low carbon imported fuels will almost always
reduce local air pollution. Its direct impact will be to increase
payment for fuel imports that may result in worsened balance
of payments, unless these are utilized to increase a nation’s
exports (Sathaye et al., 1996). The higher fuel imports will
increase dependence on international fuel supply that may
result in reduced energy security unless diversification of supply
mitigates concerns about increased dependence. Economies and
societies of low carbon fuel exporting countries would benefit
from the higher trade.

"Implementation of mitigation options often creates new
industries, for example, for energy efficient products such
as cooking stoves, efficient lamps, insulation materials, heat
pumps, and efficient motors, or for solar panels, windmills,
and biogas installations. The success of these new industries
depends on various factors, such as the degree of information,
costs, the image of the product and its traditional competitors
or its attributes other energy efficient. New industries can create
new jobs and income, and might be pioneers in new market
with significant competitive advantage. Ethanol production
from sugar waste has created a new industry and generated
employment opportunities and tax revenue for the Government
of Brazil. However, the older, outpaced industry may lose jobs.

balanced against higher capital requirements for investment in
fuel extraction, processing and delivery (Sathaye et al., 1996).
The development of large hydro sources can displace local

"Reducing or avoiding deforestation has considerable
environmental benefits. It can retain biodiversity, ecosystem

promote conservation of forest areas. The lack of enforcement
of laws that ban or limit deforestation or timber extraction has
allowed illegal extraction of logs and the burning of forests
in Indonesia (Boer, 2001) and Brazil (Boer, 2001; Fearnside,

opportunity cost of deforested land is high due to its high timber

practice should be linked to other practices such as sustainable
wood fuel production. Theoretically, N fertilizer application
increases net primary productivity (NPP) (and CO, removals),
but there is a trade-off since at the same time it increases N,O
emissions and may contaminate waters with nitrates.

"Chapter 10 emphasizes that environmentally-responsible
waste management to reduce GHG emissions at an appropriate
level of technology can promote sustainable development. In
many developing countries, uncontrolled open dumpsites,
open burning of waste, and poor sewerage practices result in
major public health hazards due to vermin, pathogens, safety
concerns, air pollution, and contamination of water resources.
Often, waste in rural areas is neither collected nor properly
managed.

"The major impediment in developing countries is the lack
of capital. Another challenge is the lack of urban planning
so that waste treatment and disposal activities are segregated
from community life. A third challenge is often the lack of
environmental regulations enforced within urban infrastructure.
In many developing countries, waste recycling occurs through
the scavenging activities of informal recycling networks.
Sustainable development includes a higher standard for these
recycling activities so that safety and health concerns are
reduced via lower technology solutions that are effective,
affordable, and sustainable.

is some areas for political reasons, contribute to misuse of
water as the true economic cost inclusive of environmental and
social costs are not reflected in the pricing and other incentive
structures. Rationalization of electricity tariffs would aid in
improving water allocation across users and over time. Through
proper institutions and effective functioning of markets, water

local knowledge. More case studies would help illustrate the
link between sustainable development and climate mitigation
in developed, developing and transition countries. A particular
challenge in this regard is that such policies will necessarily
be context specific and will work only when structured within
local and national realities. This means that a lot of the research
required is at the local and national levels to identify policy
options and choices that might best work within the contexts of

The CDM channels non-trivial amounts of money towards
developing countries. In 2005, the CDM channelled about
US$2.5 billion to purchase carbon credits in developing
countries (Capoor and Ambrosi, 2006), or 0.75% of the
(record) net foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow in
developing countries for that year (UNCTAD, 2006). In
addition, it can be argued that the CDM leverages new
private capital to developing countries.

Since carbon payments are payable in strong currencies,
and usually originate from buyers with strong credit ratings,
they provide the seller with additional opportunities to raise
additional capital and debt from banks and other finance
institutions (Mathy et a/., 2001; Lecocq and Capoor, 2005).
The geographical distribution of CDM projects tends to
follow FDI flows with most of the financial flows towards
large middle-income countries (Fenhann, 2006), and very
little financial flows towards least developed countries,
notably in Sub-Saharan Africa (Capoor and Ambrosi,
2006).

Projects mitigating non-CO, gases (HFC23, N,O and CH,)
represent the bulk of the volume of emission reductions
exchanged under the CDM. However, projects with the
highest direct benefits for local communities deliver fewer
emission reductions and are in general accompanied by
higher transaction costs. Resolving the tension between
global emission reductions and local benefits is a key
challenge for the future of climate change regime (Ellisa et
al., 2007).

to explicate the widely noted variation in response to climate

It is apparent, therefore, that capacity is a necessary, but not
sufficient, condition for mitigative action. Phenomena such as
risk perception, science/policy interactions, and relationships
between industry and regulators, for instance, may play some
role in determining whether or not capacity is turned into action

"Changing development pathways involves multiple actors,
at multiple scales. The roles of different actors and joint actions
in changing development pathways need further research,

complex process of decision-making, theories of which need
to be applied to sustainable development and mitigation. A
particular focus in this area might be identifying patterns of
investment and their implications for GHG emissions. Again,
much of this research will have to be contextually specific and
related to specific local and national contexts.

"While future research must focus on multiple sectors, actors
and scales, a key area of investigation will remain the role for
international agreements. Reconciling the role for international
coordination mechanisms with decentralized policy approaches
is challenging and requires further evaluation. An area of
particular importance in this context is international agreements
that are not specific to climate change but whose structure and
implementation can affect development paths. These include
voluntary international agreements, such as those on the
implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
to specific Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs),
such as those on desertification, on biodiversity, to the related
provisions of international policy instruments within the World
Trade Organization (WTO). All these agreements, including
the WTO, now claim sustainable development as their ultimate
goal.

assessing how well different instruments meet these criteria,
although it should be kept in mind that all instruments can be

attractive or unattractive. In addition, all instruments must be

that can be drawn from the literature are that:

literature on policies, instruments and co-operative
arrangements, focusing mainly on new information that has
emerged since the Third Assessment Report (TAR). It reviews
national policies, international agreements and initiatives of
sub-national governments, corporations and non-governmental
organizations (NGOs).
"	Text
"Reducing emissions across all sectors and gases requires
a portfolio of policies tailored to fit specific national
circumstances. While the advantages and disadvantages of any
one given instrument can be found in the literature, four main
criteria are widely used by policymakers to select and evaluate
policies: environmental effectiveness, cost-effectiveness,
distributional effects (including equity) and _ institutional
feasibility. Other more specific criteria, such as effects on
competitiveness and administrative feasibility, are generally
subsumed within these four.

The literature on climate change continues to reflect the
wide variety of national policies and measures that are available
to governments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions. These include regulations and standards, taxes and
charges, tradable permits, voluntary agreements, subsidies,
financial incentives, research and development programmes
and information instruments. Other policies, such as those
affecting trade, foreign direct investment, consumption and
social development goals, can also affect GHG emissions.
Climate change policies, if integrated with other government
polices, can contribute to sustainable development in developed
and developing countries alike.
"	Text
"e Regulatory measures and standards generally provide
some certainty of emissions levels, but their environmental
effectiveness depends on their stringency. They may be
preferable when information or other barriers prevent firms
and consumers from responding to price signals (high
agreement/much evidence).

e Taxes and charges are generally cost-effective, but they
cannot guarantee a particular level of emissions, and they
may be politically difficult to implement and, if necessary,
adjust. As with regulations, their environmental effectiveness
depends on stringency (high agreement/much evidence).

of allowed emissions determines the carbon price and the

"Voluntary agreements (VAs) between industry and
governments, which vary considerably in scope and stringency,
are politically attractive, raise awareness among stakeholders
and have played a role in the evolution of many national
policies. A few have accelerated the application of best
available technology and led to measurable reductions of
emissions compared to the baseline, particularly in countries
with traditions of close cooperation between government
and industry. However, there is little evidence that VAs have
achieved significant reductions in emissions beyond business
as usual (high agreement/much evidence). The successful
programmes all include clear targets, a baseline scenario, third
party involvement in design and review and formal provisions
for monitoring.
"	Text
"Financial incentives are frequently used by governments
to stimulate the diffusion of new, less GHG-emitting
technologies. While economic costs are generally higher
for these than for other instruments, financial incentives are
often critical to overcoming the barriers to the penetration of
new technologies (high agreement/much evidence). Direct
and indirect subsidies for fossil fuel use and agriculture
remain common practice, although those for coal have
declined over the past decade in many Organization for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and in
some developing countries.

Government support through financial contributions,
taxation measures, standard setting and market creation is
important to the promotion of technology development,
innovations and transfer. However, government funding
for many energy research programmes has fallen off since
the oil shock in the 1970s and stayed constant at this lower
level, even after the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was ratified. Substantial
additional investments in — and policies for — Research and
Development (R&D) are needed to ensure that technologies
are ready for commercialization in order to arrive at a
stabilization of GHGs in the atmosphere (see Chapter 3),
as are economic and regulatory instruments to promote
their deployment and diffusion (high agreement/much
evidence).

Information instruments, including public disclosure
requirements, may affect environmental quality by
promoting better-informed choices and lead to support for
government policy. There is only limited evidence that the
provision of information can achieve emissions reductions,
but it can improve the effectiveness of other policies (high
agreement/medium evidence).

"(high agreement/much evidence). The design of a future regime
will have significant implications for global costs and the
distribution of cost among regions at different points in time
There is a broad consensus in the literature that a successful
agreement will have to be environmentally effective and cost-
effective, incorporate distributional considerations and equity
and be institutionally feasible (high agreement/much evidence).
Agreements are more likely to be effective if they include goals,
specific actions, timetables, participation and_ institutional
arrangements and provisions for reporting and compliance
(high agreement/much evidence).
"	Text
"Goals determine the extent of participation, the stringency
of the measures and the timing of the actions. For example, to
limit the temperature increase to 2°C above pre-industrial levels,
developed countries would need to reduce emissions in 2020
by 10-40% below 1990 levels and in 2050 by approximately
40-95%. Emissions in developing countries would need to
deviate below their current path by 2020, and emissions in all
countries would need to deviate substantially below their current
path by 2050. A temperature goal of less than 2°C requires
earlier reductions and greater participation (and vice versa)
(high agreement/much evidence). Abatement costs depend on
the goal, vary by region and depend on the allocation of emission
allowances among regions and the level of participation.
"	Text
"In practice, climate-related policies are seldom applied
in complete isolation, as they overlap with other national
polices relating to the environment, forestry, agriculture, waste
management, transport and energy and, therefore, in many
cases require more than one instrument. For an environmentally
effective and cost-effective instrument mix to be applied, there
must be a good understanding of the environmental issue to be
addressed, the links with other policy areas and the interactions
between the different instruments in the mix. Applicability in
specific countries, sectors and circumstances — particularly
developing countries and economies in transition — can vary
greatly, but may be enhanced when instruments are adapted to
local circumstances (high agreement/much evidence).
"	Text
"New literature highlights the options for achieving emission
reductions both under and outside of the Convention and
its Kyoto Protocol by, for example, revising the form and
stringency of emission targets, expanding the scope of sectoral
and sub-national agreements, developing and adopting common
policies, enhancing international Research, Development
and Demonstration (RD&D) technology programmes,
implementing development-oriented actions and expanding
financing instruments (high agreement/much evidence). An
integration of diverse elements, such as international R&D
co-operation and cap and trade programmes, within an
agreement is possible, but any comparison of the efforts made
by different countries would be complex and resource-intensive
(medium agreement/medium evidence).

As precedents, the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol have
been significant in providing a means to solve a long-term
international environmental problem, but they are only first
steps towards the implementation of an international response
strategy to combat climate change. The Kyoto Protocol’s most
notable achievements are the stimulation of an array of national
policies, the creation of a carbon market and the establishment
of new institutional mechanisms. Its economic impacts on the
participating countries are yet to be demonstrated. The Clean
Development Mechanism (CDM), in particular, has created
a large project pipeline and mobilized substantial financial
resources, but it has faced methodological challenges in terms
of determining baselines and additionality. The Protocol has

Corporations, local and regional authorities and NGOs
are adopting a variety of actions to reduce GHG emissions.
Corporate actions range from voluntary initiatives to emissions
targets and, in a few cases, internal trading systems. The
reasons corporations undertake independent actions include
the desire to influence or pre-empt government action, to create
financial value, and to differentiate a company and its products.
Actions by regional, state, provincial and local governments
include renewable energy portfolio standards, energy efficiency
programmes, emission registries and sectoral cap and trade
mechanisms. These actions are undertaken to influence national
policies, address stakeholder concerns, create incentives for
new industries and/or to create environmental co-benefits. Non-
government organizations promote programmes that reduce
emissions through public advocacy, litigation and stakeholder
dialogue. Many of the above actions may limit GHG emissions,
stimulate innovative policies, encourage the deployment of new
technologies and spur experimentation with new institutions,
but they generally have limited impact on their own. To
achieve significant emission reductions, these actions must
lead to changes in national policies (high agreement/medium
evidence).

"The cost-effectiveness of a policy is a key decision
parameter in a world with scarce resources. Given a particular
environmental quality goal, the most cost-effective policy is
the one which achieves the desired goal at the least cost. There
are many components of cost, and these include both the direct
costs of administering and implementing the policy as well
as indirect costs, such as how the policy drives cost-reducing
technological change.

"Cost-effectiveness is distinct from general economic
efficiency. Whereas cost-effectiveness takes an environmental
goal as given, efficiency involves the process of selecting a
specific goal according to economic criteria (Sterner, 2003).

ostensible environmental goal for any climate policy, there

also impose indirect social costs, which are more difficult to

relate largely to equity. Equity can be defined in a number
of ways within the climate context (see IPCC, 2001). Equity
and fairness may be perceived differently by different people,
depending on the cultural background of the observer. For
example, Ringius et al. (2002) view responsibility, capacity
and need as the basic principles of fairness that seem to be
sufficiently widely recognized to serve as a normative basis for
a climate policy regime. These three principles have been used
in the evaluation of potential international climate agreements
(e.g. Torvanger et al., 2004).

"Policies rarely apportion environmental benefits and
costs evenly across stakeholders. Even if a policy meets an
environmental goal at least cost, it may face political opposition
if it disproportionately impacts — or benefits — certain groups
within a society, across societies or across generations. From an
economic perspective, a policy is considered to be beneficial if it
improves social welfare overall. However, this criterion does not
require that the implementation of that policy actually improves
the specific situation of any one individual. Consequently, as
Keohane et al. (1998) argue, distributional considerations may
be more important than aggregate cost effectiveness when
policymakers evaluate an instrument.

Voluntary measures are often favoured by industry because

was committed to high taxes.

A key element of the Uk’s climate policy is a climate levy. The levy is paid by energy users — not extractors or generators — is
levied on industry only and aims to encourage renewable energy. An 80% discount can be secured if the industry in question
participates in a negotiated ‘climate change agreement’ to reduce emissions relative to an established baseline. Any one
company over-complying with its agreement can trade the resulting credits in the UK emissions trading scheme, along with
renewable energy certificates under a separate renewable energy constraint on generators. However, a number of industrial
emitters wanted a heavier discount and, through lobbying, they managed to have a voluntary emissions trading scheme
established that enables companies with annual emissions above 10,000 tCO,-eq to bid for allocation of subsidies. The
“auction” offered payments of 360 million and yielded a de-facto payment of 27 € per tonne of CO. Thus, the trading part
of the scheme has design elements that strongly reflect the interest groups involved (Michaelowa, 2004). The levy itself has
limited coverage and, consequently, households, and energy extractors and generators have no incentive to switch to low
carbon fuels. However, its design does take household vulnerability, competitiveness concerns and the sensitivity of some
sectoral interests into account. Thus, while the levy has contributed to emission reduction, it has not been as effective as a
pure tax; a pure tax may not have been institutionally feasible.

should take to control pollution. The information requirements
for technology standards are high: the regulator must have good
and reliable information on the abatement costs and options open
to each firm. Losses in cost effectiveness arise when regulators
are less well informed; technology standards may then be
applied uniformly to a variety of firms, rather than tailoring the
standard to the actual circumstance of the firm. This raises costs
without improving environmental effectiveness and is one of
the main drawbacks to regulatory standards.

One problem with regulatory standards is that they do not
provide polluters with the incentive(s) to search for better
approaches to reducing pollution. Thus, they may not perform
well in inducing innovation and technological change (Jaffe
et al., 2003; Sterner, 2003). If a government mandates a
certain technology, there is no economic incentive for firms
to develop more effective technologies. Moreover, there may
be a ‘regulatory ratchet’ whereby firms are discouraged from
developing more effective technologies out of fear that standards
will be tightened yet again (Harrington ef al., 2004). Finally,
although it may be possible to force some technological change
through technology mandates, it is difficult for regulators to
determine the amount of change that is possible at a reasonable
economic cost. This raises the possibility of implementing either
costly, overly stringent requirements or, alternatively, weak,
unambitious requirements (Jaffe et al., 2003). Nevertheless,
there are examples in the literature of technology innovations
spurred by regulatory standards. For example, Watzold (2004)
reported innovative responses from pollution control vendors in
Germany in response to standards for SO, control.

degree of precision the action(s) that a firm or individual must
undertake to achieve environmental objectives and can consist
of such actions as specifying technologies or products to use or

proclaiming dictates on acceptable and unacceptable behaviour.
Two broad classes of regulatory standards are technology and
performance standards. Technology standards mandate specific
pollution abatement technologies or production methods, while
performancestandards mandate specific environmentaloutcomes
per unit of product. In this context, where a technology standard
might mandate specific CO, capture and storage methods on a
power plant, a performance standard would limit emissions to a
certain number of grams of CO, per kilowatt-hour of electricity
generated. A product standard would, for example, be the
requirement that refrigerators operate minimally at a specified
level of efficiency, while a technology-forcing standard would
involve setting the refrigerator efficiency requirement slightly
beyond present-day technological feasibility but announcing
that the efficiency requirement will not go into effect until a
number of years following the announcement.

Because GHGs have different effects on atmospheric warming per unit of emissions, the use of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO,-eq) is one way of measuring relative impact.
An alternative is the idea of threshold taxes, where the tax per unit of emissions is only assessed on emissions greater than a set threshold (Pezzey 2003). In other words, infra-

marginal emissions would be tax-exempt. This type of tax would generate less revenue but could be more politically acceptable.

contractors to use energy efficient building materials and to adopt energy-saving technology in heating, air conditioning,

other major cities in the northern parts of the country. Whether future buildings will be able to comply with the requirements

"Tradable permit systems can be designed to cover either
emissions from a few sectors of the economy or those from
virtually the entire economy.? A number of analyses have found
that economy-wide approaches are superior to sectoral coverage
because they equalize marginal costs across the entire economy.

"Emission taxes do well in both cost effectiveness and
environmental effectiveness. The real obstacles facing the use
of emission taxes and charges are distributional and, in some
countries, institutional. At the best of times, new taxes are not
politically popular. Furthermore, emissions or energy taxes
often fall disproportionately on lower income classes, thereby
creating negative distributional consequences. In developing
countries, institutions may be insufficiently developed for the
collection of emission fees from a wide variety of dispersed
sources. In many countries, state enterprises play a significant
role; such public or quasi-private entities may not respond
adequately to the incentive effects of a tax or charge.

"adjust the tax level to meet an internationally agreed emissions
commitment (depending on the structure of the international
agreement). Over time, an emissions tax needs to be adjusted
for changes in external circumstances, such as inflation,
technological progress and new emissions sources (Tietenberg,
2000). Fixed emissions charges in the transition economies of
Eastern Europe, for example, have been significantly eroded by
the high inflation of the past decade (Bluffstone and Larson,
1997). Innovation and invention generally have the opposite
effect by reducing the cost of emissions reductions and
increasing the level of reductions implemented. If the tax is
intended to achieve a given overall emissions limit, the tax rate
will need to be increased to offset the impact of new sources
(Tietenberg, 2000).

"Most environmentally related taxes with implications
for GHG emissions in OECD countries are levied on energy
products (150 taxes) and on motor vehicles (125 taxes), rather
than on CO, emission directly. There is also a significant number
of waste-related taxes in OECD countries (about 50 taxes in
all), levied either on particular products that can cause particular
problems for waste management (about 35 taxes) or on various
forms of final waste disposal, including those on incineration
and/or land-filling (15 taxes in all). A very significant share of
all the revenues from environmentally related taxes originates
from taxes on motor fuels. Such taxes were introduced in all
member countries many decades ago — primarily as a means
to raise revenue. Irregardless of the underlying reasoning for
their implementation, however, they do impact on the prices
(potential) car users are confronted with and thus have important
environmental impacts.

"To implement a domestic emissions tax, governments must
consider a number of issues, such as the level at which the tax
should be set, particularly in the case of pre-existing taxes (e.g.
taxes which already exist on energy), or other potential distortions
(e.g. subsidies to certain industries or fuels). Consideration
must also be given to how the tax is used, with such options
as whether it goes directly into general government coffers, is
used to offset other taxes (i.e. the double-dividend effect), is
transferred across national boundaries to an international body,
is earmarked for specific abatement projects, such as renewable
energy, or is allocated to those most adversely impacted by
either the costs of emission reduction or damage from climate
change. Another important issue is the point at which the tax
is should be levied. A tax on gasoline may be levied at the
pump and collected directly from consumers or it may be
levied on wholesale gasoline production and collected from oil
companies. In either case, the final consumer ultimately pays
most of this cost, but the administrative and monitoring costs
may differ dramatically in the two cases.

"However, there is some experience with the direct taxation
of CO, emissions. The Nordic Council of Ministers (2002)
notes that CO, emissions in Denmark decreased by 6% during
the period 1988-1997 while the economy grew by 20%, but
that they also decreased by 5% in a single year — between 1996
and 1997 — when the tax rate was raised. Bruvoll and Larsen
(2004) analysed the specific effect of carbon taxes in Norway.
Although total emissions did increase, these researchers found
a significant reduction in emissions per unit of GDP over the
period due to reduced energy intensity, changes in the energy
mix and reduced process emissions. The overall effect of the
carbon tax was, however, modest, which may be explained by
the extensive tax exemptions and relatively inelastic demand
in those sectors in which the tax was actually implemented.
Cambridge Econometrics (2005) analysed the impacts of the
Climate Change Levy in the UK and found that total CO,
emissions were reduced by 3.1 MtC — or 2.0% — in 2002 and by
3.6 MtC in 2003 compared to the reference case. The reduction
is estimated to grow to 3.7 MtC — or 2.3% — in 2010.

"The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) is the world’s largest tradable permits programme. The programme was initiated
on January 1, 2005, and it applies to approximately 11,500 installations across the EU’s 25 Member States. The system

covers about 45% of the EU’s total CO, emissions and includes facilities from the electric power sector and other major
industrial sectors.

"The first phase of the EU ETS runs from 2005 until 2007. The second phase will begin in 2008 and continue through to 2012,
coinciding with the 5-year Kyoto compliance period. Member States develop National Allocation Plans, which describe in
detail how allowances will be distributed to different sectors and installations. During the first phase, Member States may
auction off up to 5% of their allowances; during the second phase, up to 10% of allowances may be auctioned off.

"Notonly the coverage of sectors may vary ina tradable permits
programme, but also the point of obligation. The responsibility
for holding permits may be assigned directly to emitters, such
as energy-using industrial facilities (downstream), to producers
or processors of fuels (upstream) or to some combination of the
two (a ‘hybrid system’).!! The upstream system would require
permits to be held at the level of fossil fuel wholesalers and
importers (Cramton and Kerr, 2002).!2

"Implications of free allocation on electricity prices: Sijm et a/. (2006) report that a significant percentage of the value of
allowances allocated to the power sector was passed on to consumers in the price of electricity and that this pass-through of
costs could result in substantially increased profits by some companies. The authors suggest that auctioning a larger share
of allowances could address these distributional issues. In a report for the UK government, IPA Energy Consulting found a
similar cost pass-through for the UK and other EU Member States (IPA Energy Consulting, 2005).

"Market development and prices: A number of factors affect allowance prices in the EU ETS, including the overall size of the
allocation, relative fuel prices, weather and the availability of certified emission reductions (CERs) from the Clean Development
Mechanism (CDM) (Christiansen et a/., 2005). The EU ETS experienced significant price volatility during its start-up period,
and for a brief period in April 2006 prices rose to nearly 30 per tonne; however, prices subsequently dropped dramatically
when the first plant-level emissions data from Member States were released. The sharp decline in prices focused attention
on the size of the initial Phase | allocation. Analysts have concluded that this initial allocation was a small reduction from
business as usual emissions (Grubb et a/., 2005; Betz et a/., 2004).

"Consistency in national allocation plans: Several studies have documented differences in the allocation plans and
methodologies of Member States (Betz et a/., 2004; Zetterberg et a/. 2004; Baron and Philibert, 2005; DEHSt, 2005).
Researchers have looked at the impact on innovation and investment incentives of different aspects of allocation rules
(Matthes et al/., 2005; Schleich and Betz, 2005) and have found that these rules can affect technology choices and investment
decisions. Ahman et al. (2006), Neuhoff et a/. (2006) and Betz et al., (2004) find that when Member States’ policies require
the confiscation of allowances following the closure of facilities, this creates a subsidy for continued operation of older
facilities and a disincentive to build new facilities. They further find that different formulas for new entrants can impact on

the market.

"A final issue associated with the distribution of allowances
is whether excessive market power can distort prices. Maeda

the potential emergence of firms with market power. Tietenberg
(2006) summarizes research on market power, including studies
on whether different auction designs or initial permit allocation
can lead to price manipulation by dominant firms. He concludes
that in practice, market power ‘typically has not been a problem
in emissions trading.’ There has yet to be an overall assessment
of market power in the EU ETS.

"To date, most emissions trading programmes have distributed
emissions allowances almost entirely through free allocations. !4
Experience with the US SO, programme shows that the
no-cost allocation of allowances was critical for gaining political
acceptance for the emissions trading concept (Ellerman, 2005).
Christiansen and Wettestad (2003) and Markussen and Svendsen
(2005) discuss how interest group pressures led to a largely free
allocation of allowances in the EU ETS. In a broader sense,
the rationale for a policy allowing some free allocation of
allowances based on historic emissions is based on the desire
to compensate incumbent installations that are affected by
the regulation (Tietenberg, 2003; Harrison and Radov, 2002,
Ahman et al. 2006).

"The number of publications exploring the efficiency, equity
and competitiveness implications of allowance allocation
approaches is continuing to grow. For example, Burtraw et
al. (2001b) and Fischer (2001) found that periodic updates
of allocations on the basis of production are economically
inefficient. In an analysis of a potential emissions trading
programme in Alberta, Canada, Haites (2003b) found that
this type of periodic updating of allocations based on each
source’s output may reduce the decline in production for some
sectors that may arise from an emissions cap but that it may
also reduce profits and raise overall costs when compared to a
fixed allocation. Demailly and Quirion (2006) find that under
certain assumptions, an output-based allocation in the European
cement industry would reduce leakage with limited impacts on
production. See Chapter 11, Section 11.7.4 for a more extensive
discussion on competitiveness issues.
"	Text
"Although a tradable permits approach can ensure that a
certain quantity of emissions will be reduced, it does not provide
any certainty of price. Price uncertainty may be addressed by a
‘price cap’ or ‘safety valve’ mechanism, which guarantees that
the government will sell additional permits if the market price
of allowances hits a certain price (Pizer, 2002; McKibbon and
Wilcoxen; 2002, Jacoby and Ellerman; 2004).!6 The underlying
reasoning is that GHGs become the focus of concern as they
accumulate over an extended period in the atmosphere. There
may therefore be less concern about short-term increases
in CO, as long as the overall trajectory of CO, emissions is
downward over an extended period (Newell and Pizer, 2003).
While the safety valve mechanism shares some advantages
with price-based mechanisms, such as a tax, the former may
have the added political advantage of providing emitters
with an additional allocation of allowances (Pizer, 2005a). A
safety valve mechanism does not provide any certainty that a
particular emissions level will be met, and it requires additional
administrative complexity to link a domestic programme with
a safety valve to a programme without a safety valve or with a
different safety valve price.

"Several authors have compared the advantages and
disadvantages of absolute targets (i.e., mass emissions limits
on a sector or economy) to those of intensity targets (i.e. limits
on emission per unit of GDP).!5 Ellerman and Wing (2003)
and Kolstad (2006) find that intensity targets can reduce the
uncertainties associated with the cost of emission reduction
under uncertain economic growth levels. Pizer (2005b) finds
that intensity targets may be more appropriate if the short-term
objective is to slow, rather than halt, emissions growth, while
Ellerman and Wing (2003) show that an intensity target may
be set so stringently that it can halt or reverse growth. Dudek
and Golub (2003) argue that absolute targets have more certain
environmental results and lower transaction costs for emissions
trading, thereby creating stronger incentives for technological
change. Kuik and Mulder (2004) find that, for the EU, an
intensity or relative target would avoid negative effects on
competitiveness but would not reduce emissions at the lowest
costs. In contrast, an absolute target combined with permit
trading leads to efficient emissions reduction, but its overall
macroeconomic costs may be significant. Finally, Quirion
(2005) argues that, in the most plausible cases, an emissions
tax and an absolute target are superior to an intensity target and
that the welfare gaps between the two types of targets are very
small. Overall, intensity targets are less effective than absolute
targets if the goal is to achieve a certain level of emissions
reduction, but they may be more effective at addressing costs
when economic growth is uncertain.

18 The addition of a “make good” provision — that is, the requirement stating that allowances from a subsequent compliance year or period are surrendered for any exce

"Voluntary agreements are agreements between a government
authority and one ormore private parties to achieve environmental
objectives or to improve environmental performance beyond
compliance to regulated obligations. Voluntary agreements are
playing an increasingly important role in many countries as a
means to achieve environmental and social objectives. They tend
to be popular with those directly affected and can be used when
other instruments face strong political opposition (Thalmann
and Baranzini, 2005). Box 13.5 provides examples of VAs. See
Chapter 7, Section 7.9.2 for additional information.

"The benefits of VAs for individual companies and for
society may be significant. Firms may enjoy lower legal costs,
enhance their reputation and improve their relationships with
society on a whole and shareholders in particular. Societies gain
to the extent that firms translate goals into concrete business
practices and persuade other firms to follow their example.
The negotiations involved to develop VAs raise awareness of
climate change issues and potential mitigative actions within
industry (Kagestrém ef al., 2000), establish a dialogue between
industry and government and help shift industries towards best
practices.
"	Text
"Evaluating the effectiveness of VAs is not easy. The standard
approach is first to measure the environmental performance of
a group of firms participating in a VA and then to compare the
performance to that of a typical non-participating firm or firms.
One problem with this approach is selection bias: it is often
the best-performing firms that enter into a VA. A second and
related problem is the counterfactual: it is difficult to know
what a firm might have done had they not entered into the VA.
Very few studies have attempted to evaluate VAs by taking into
account both of these issues. Studies which do not take these
factors into account can produce an overly optimistic view of
the performance of a VA.
"	Text
"Voluntary agreements can take on many forms with varying
levels of stringency. While all VAs are ‘voluntary’ insofar as
firms are not compelled to join, some may involve incentives
(rewards or penalties) for participation. Firms may agree to direct
emissions reductions or to indirect reductions through changes
in product design (see Chapter 6, Section 6.8.2.2.). Agreements
may be stand-alone, but they are often used in conjunction with
other policy instruments. Voluntary agreements are also a subset
of a larger set of ‘voluntary approaches’ in which industry may
first negotiate standards of behaviour with other firms or private
groups and then allow third parties to monitor compliance. This
larger set also includes unilateral voluntary actions by industry.
See Section 13.4, Box 13.5, and Chapter 7, Section 7.9.2 for
more information on voluntary actions.

"Several critical elements of an effective enforcement regime
for emissions trading have been described in the literature. First,
if the goal is strict adherence to the emission limits implied by
the number of permits, then excess emissions penalties should
be set at levels substantially higher than the prevailing permit
price in order to create the appropriate incentives for compliance
(Swift, 2001; Stranland et al., 2002).!8 A second component
of an enforcement regime is reasonably accurate emissions
monitoring (Stranland ef a/., 2002; Stavins, 2003). San Martin
(2003) and Montero (2005) report that incomplete monitoring
can undermine the efficiency of trading programmes. Tietenberg
(2003) and Kruger et al. (2000) emphasize that public access to
emissions and trading data provides an additional incentive for
compliance.

"Experience with trading programmes in the USA has shown
significant benefits can be derived from the temporal flexibility
provided by banking provisions in cases where the exact
timing of emission reductions is not critical to environmental
effectiveness (Ellerman et al., 2000; Stavins, 2003). Allowance
banking can create a cushion that will prevent price spikes and
can hedge uncertainty in allowance prices (Jacoby and Ellerman,
2004).!7 A banking provision allows the arbitrage between actual
marginal abatement costs in one phase of a programme and the
expected abatement costs in a future phase of a programme.
The temporal flexibility of banking is particularly useful for
companies facing large capital expenditures because it provides
some flexibility in the timing of those expenditures (Tietenberg,
2003). In some emission markets in the USA, banking has been
restricted where there was concern about short-term increases
in emissions (Tietenberg, 2006). Banking was also restricted
between Phase I and Phase 2 in the EU ETS to avoid a large
bank that would make it more difficult to meet Kyoto targets.

"Finally, there have been several experiments with tradable
permits for conventional pollution control in developing
countries and economies in transition (Bygrave, 2004; US
EPA, 2004). For example, Montero et al. (2002) evaluate
an experiment with tradable permits for total suspended
particulates (TSP) in Santiago, Chile and find that permit
markets are underdeveloped due to high transaction costs,
uncertainty and poor enforcement. However, they also find an
improved documentation of historic emissions inventories and
an increased flexibility to address changing market conditions.
S. Gupta (2003b) and Wang et al. (2004) suggest strengthening
the monitoring and enforcement capacity that would be required
to implement conventional pollution trading programmes in
India and China, respectively. Several authors have concluded
that tradable permit programmes may be less appropriate for
developing countries due to their lack of appropriate market
or enforcement institutions. (Blackman and Harrington, 2000,

whether the voluntary agreements in The Netherlands have
resulted in improvements in energy efficiency beyond what
would have occurred in the absence of such agreements. They

"Others are more sceptical about the efficacy of VAs in
reducing emissions. Independent assessments of VAs — while
acknowledging that investments in cleaner technologies have

is little improvement over business-as-usual (BAU) scenarios,
as these investments would have probably happened anyway
(Harrison, 1999; King and Lenox, 2000; Rietbergen and Blok,

administrative, environmental and performance requirements.
For example, two thirds did not require participants to create
environmental targets and to demonstrate that the targets

slightly stronger requirements. According to Hanks (2002)

formal provisions for monitoring, reporting and independent

"There are a limited, although increasing, number of
comprehensive reviews of the effectiveness of VAs, but any
comparison of these reviews and assessments is difficult because
of the different metrics and evaluative criteria employed (Price,
2005). In general, studies of the design and efficacy of VAs
assess only a single programme (e.g. Arora and Cason, 1996;
Khanna and Damon, 1999; King and Lenox, 2000; Welch et
al., 2000; Rivera, 2002; Croci, 2005). Based on her evaluation
of the French experience, Chidiak (2002) suggests that the
reductions in GHG emissions cannot necessarily be seen as a
direct consequence of the commitments within the agreements
and argues that, in actual fact, these improvements have been
triggered largely as a result of other environmental regulations
and cost reduction efforts. Johannsen (2002) and Helby (2002)
present similar results for programmes in Denmark and Sweden,
respectively. They note that reductions in specific emissions
correspond with industry’s BAU behaviour, thereby suggesting
that the stated objectives in the agreements were not sufficiently
ambitious. In particular, Helby concludes that EKO-Energi,
which sought to highlight a new level of best practice and thus
pose a challenge to other firms, was ‘at best a very modest
success,’ resulting in a small overall direct effect on total
industrial energy consumption. Interestingly, Chidiak also finds
that the agreements did not foster intra-industry networking and
information exchange on energy management and suggests that
their failure to achieve more ambitious goals is a result of the
lack of a well-articulated policy-mix. Other analyses indicate
that VAs work best as part of a policy package, rather than as a
stand-alone instrument (Krarup and Ramesohl, 2002; Torvanger
and Skodvin, 2002). OECD (2003e) and Braathen (2005) note
that many of the current VAs would perform better if there were
a real threat of other instruments being used if targets are not
met.

a source of GHG emissions, subsidies may result in higher

use of these fuels with resulting higher emissions; subsidies

consumption and delayed investments in energy-efficient
technologies. In India, kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas
(LPG) subsidies are generally intended to shift consumption
from biomass to modern fuels, reduce deforestation and
improve indoor air quality, particularly in poor rural areas. In
reality, these subsidies are largely used by higher expenditure
groups in urban areas, thus having little effect on the use of

done cautiously, in the absence of substitutes, as some rural

"The USA and Japan, the two largest investors in energy R&D,
spent on average of 3.38 and 2.45 billion US$, respectively,
between 1975 and 1999. However, such figures mask important
underlying trends. For example, a large percentage of the
funding designated for energy R&D has gone into nuclear power
— nearly 75% in the case of Japan (Sagar and van der Zwaan
2006). The support of the US government for R&D declined by
1 billion US$ from 1994 to 2003, with reductions implemented
in nearly all energy technologies, while R&D investments in
other areas grew by 6% per year. Between the 1980s and 2003,
private sector energy R&D declined from nearly 50% of that
of government funding to about 25% (Nemet and Kammen,

"One of the most effective incentives for fostering GHG
reductions are the price supports associated with the production
of renewable electricity, which tend to be set at attractive levels.
These price supports have resulted in the significant expansion
of the renewable energy sector in OECD countries due to
the requirement that electric power producers purchase such
electricity at favourable prices. The US Public Utility Regulatory
Policy Act of 1978 requires electric utilities to buy renewable
energy at “avoided cost”. In Europe, specific prices have been
set at which utilities must purchase renewable electricity —
these are referred to as ‘feed-in tariffs’. These tariffs have been
effective at promoting the development of renewable sources of
electricity (Ackermann et a/., 2001; Menanteau et al., 2003). As
long as renewables remain a relatively small portion of overall
electricity production, consumers see only a small increase
in their electricity rates. Incentives therefore have attractive
properties in terms of environmental effectiveness, distributional
implications and institutional feasibility. The main problem
with them is cost-effectiveness: They are costly instruments,
particularly in the long-run as interests and industries grow to
expect the continuation of subsidy programmes. See Chapter
4.5 for a more extensive discussion.

28 An assessment of private public research partnership under the Advanced Technology Programme in the USA indicates that ‘Time lags, along with the difficulty inherent in

retrospective evaluation of factors affecting the timing and character of innovations, make it difficult to attribute specific commercial advantages to funding awarded much
earlier.’ In general, companies shift funds away from basic research towards product modifications and extensions.

"In summary, national programmes and_ international
cooperation relating to R&D are essential long-term measures
to stimulate technological advances. Substantial additional
investments in and policies for R&D are needed, depending on
the specific goals: for example, if high stabilization levels are
desired (e.g. 750 ppmv CO,-eq, which is scenario category D
of Chapter 3 of this report), a technology-focused approach that
defers emissions reduction to the future would be sufficient;
for low stabilization goals (e.g. 450 ppmv CO,-eq, which
is category Al, or 550 ppmv CO,-eq, which is category B),
strong incentives for short-term emission reductions would
be necessary in addition to technological development and
deployment programmes. See Section 13.3 for a discussion of
goals.

"Policies that directly affect the environmental externality
have a much larger impact on both atmospheric temperature
and economic welfare. Fischer and Newell (2004) examine
several policy options to promote renewables and indicate that
research subsidies are the most expensive approach to achieve
emission reductions — in the absence of higher prices. They
note that the process of technological change is less important
than the implementation of direct incentives to reduce emission
intensity or overall energy use. A more specific example arises
from the Danish experience with wind technologies. Meyer
(2004) notes that despite significant support for wind energy
R&D during the 1980s, wind power only boomed in Denmark
when favourable feed-in tariffs were introduced, procedures for
construction allowances were simplified and priority was given
for green electricity. This is supported by Nemet (2005), who
found that the ability to raise capital and take risks has played
a much larger role in the recent expansion of the photovoltaic
industry than other factors, such as learning by experience.

"consumption. For a more extensive discussion of technological
learning, energy supply models and the link to R&D, see Chapter
3, Section 3.4.2 and Chapter 11, Section 11.3.3. Watanabe
(1999) argues that government R&D can play a role in achieving
breakthroughs in some areas, induce investments by industry in
R&D and generate trans-sectoral spill over effects. Others have
noted, however, that the benefits of R&D may not be realized
for two to three decades, which is beyond the planning horizons
of even the most forward-looking companies (Anderson and
Bird, 1992) and that, for a variety of reasons, industry can
only appropriate a fraction of the benefits of R&D investments
(Margolis and Kammen ,1999). In the energy sector in particular,
technology ‘spill over’ to competitors is large; as a result, firms
under-invest in R&D (Azar and Dowlatabadi 1999) and face
difficulties in evaluating intangible R&D outputs (Alic et al.
2003).8 In addition, regulatory interventions can cap profits in
the case of path-breaking research success (Foxon and Kemp,
2004; Grubb, 2004).29 Goulder and Schneider (1999) argue
that increasing R&D expenditures in carbon-free technologies
could crowd out R&D in the rest of the economy and therefore
reduce overall growth rates. However, Azar and Dowlatabadi
(1999) counter that radical technological change will trigger
more research overall and therefore increase economy-wide
productivity rates.

"The OECD (2005b) finds that obligations/quotas, price
guarantees and tax preferences have had the most influence on
innovation and patent activities in the renewable energy sector
and that while public subsidies for R&D have not played a role,
the overall level of investment in R&D within the economy of
a country has been important. Sathaye ef a/. (2005) observe that
government-funded research at government-owned facilities,
private companies and universities may help identify patentable
technologies and processes. They reviewed the process of
allocating patent rights in four OECD countries and found that
intellectual property rights (IPR) regimes have changed since
the ratification of the UNFCCC, with diffusion typically taking
place along a pathway of licensing or royalty payments rather
than unrestricted use in the public domain. Popp (2002) also
examined patent citations and found that the level of energy-
saving R&D depends not only on energy prices, but also on the
quality of the accumulated knowledge available to inventors. He
finds evidence for diminishing returns to research inputs — both
across time and within a given year — and notes that government
patents filed in or after 1981 are more likely to be cited. Popp
(2004) notes that when in terms of the potential for technology
to help solve the climate problem, two market failures lead
to underinvestment in climate-friendly R&D: environmental
externalities and the public goods nature of the new knowledge.
As a result, government subsidies to climate-friendly R&D
projects are often proposed as part of a policy solution.

them more at risk to the potential impacts of climate change,

can be reduced without raising emissions, then a strategy to
reduce poverty can be seen as a way to reduce emissions as well

these measures are preferable to information policies. Based
on a recent theoretical study, Petrtakis et al. (2005) reports
that information provision can be more effective than tax
instruments, especially when the information can be provided
at low cost. Osgood (2002) provides limited empirical support
in the context of weather information programmes in Mexico

"Evidence-to-date suggests that while disclosure mandates
may be effective at changing a firm’s environmental practices,
other information instruments, such as advisory programmes,
have less effect on consumer behaviour (Konar and Cohen,
1997). Firms whose stock price declined significantly when
pollution data became publicly available reduced their emissions
more than other firms in the same industry. Firms may view
information policies as overly burdensome and argue that
voluntarily provided information is sufficient (Sterner, 2003).
Certainly, there is a cost to disclosure and labelling policies, and
costs depend on the level of information required by a policy
(Beierle, 2004). A firm may have to collect and disseminate
information they would not otherwise have gathered, and
government agencies must be able to verify that the information
is accurate.

"Single instruments are unlikely to be sufficient for climate
change mitigation, and it is more likely that a portfolio of
policies will be required (see IPCC, 2001). Examples of areas
where there are potential synergies include water management
strategies, farm practices, forest management strategies and
residential building standards. Instruments that maximize
potential synergies could become socially and economically
efficient and may offer opportunities for countries to achieve
sustainable development targets, even in the face ofuncertainties.
This is especially important given the limited financial and
human resources in developing countries (Dang et al., 2003).
Climate change considerations also provide both developing
and developed countries with an opportunity to look closely at
their respective development strategies from a new perspective.
Fulfilling development goals through policy reforms in such
areas as energy efficiency, renewable energy, sustainable land
use and/or agriculture will often also generate benefits related

In such a case, a price signal alone may not sufficiently spur
the diffusion of these types of technologies. One solution to
this type of barrier is an eco-labelling system, which can help
increase the effectiveness of a price instrument by providing
better information on relevant characteristics of the product
(OECD, 2003b; Braathen, 2005). Sijm (2005) notes that this
type of market failure may exist for households who may lack
the relevant information to invest in energy efficiency measures
and may not respond to a price signal. Another market failure in
the residential sector may be caused by split incentives where
neither the landlord nor tenant has an incentive to invest in

policies might be desirable. Johnstone (2002) argues that the price

to overcome barriers to technological development and diffusion

include: (1) credit market failures that discourage lenders from
providing capital to firms for high-risk investments associated
with R&D and even the implementation of new technologies and
(2) reduced incentives for private investment in R&D if firms can
not prevent other firms from benefiting from their investments
(i.e. ‘spill-over’ effects).3° Fischer and Newell (2004) find that
the combination of a technology policy, such as government
sponsored R&D, with a tax or tradable permit instrument could
help overcome this type of market imperfection.

"There may be cases where a package of CO, mitigation
policies is justified if these policies serve multiple policy
objectives. Sijm (2005) gives several examples of policies and
objectives that may be compatible with the EU ETS, including
direct regulation that also reduces local environmental effects
from other pollutants. Renewable energy policies can be used
to expand energy supply, increase rural income and reduce
conventional pollutants. Policies that encourage bio-fuel
production and automobile fuel efficiency have also been
advocated for their advantages in encouraging energy security
and fuel diversity as well as GHG mitigation. In the USA, these
types of energy policies have been proposed in conjunction
with a tradable permits system as part of a package to address
energy, security and environmental objectives (NCEP, 2004).

"With the implementation of the EU ETS, particular attention
has been given to the interaction between a tradable permits
mechanism and other policies. Sijm (2005) and Sorrell and
Sijm (2003) argue that an emissions trading scheme can co-
exist with other instruments as long as these other instruments
improve the efficiency of the trading mechanism by addressing
market failures or contributing to some other policy objective.
However, they argue that the combination of an emissions
trading scheme with other instruments could also lead to
“double regulation”, reduced efficiency and increased costs if
policies are not designed carefully. NERA (2005) and Morthorst
(2001) assess the interaction of renewable energy policies with
tradable permits programmes and conclude that if not designed
properly, these policies can lower allowance prices but raise the
overall costs of the programme.

"Climate-related policies are seldom applied in complete
isolation: in a large number of cases one or more instruments
will be applied. The mere existence of an instrument
mix, however, is clearly not ‘proof’ of its environmental
effectiveness and economic efficiency. A rather obvious first
requirement for applying an environmentally and economically
effective instrument mix is to have a good understanding of
the environmental issue to be addressed. In practice, many
environmental issues can be complex. While a tax can affect
the total demand for a product and the choice between different
product varieties, it is less suited to address, for example,
how a given product is used and when it is used. Hence,
other instruments could be needed. A second requirement for
designing efficient and effective policies is to have a good
understanding of the links with other policy areas: not only do
different environmental policies need to be co-ordinated, but
co-ordination with other related policies is also necessary.
A third requirement is to have a good understanding of the
interactions between the different instruments in the mix.

the criteria that receive the most weight will be those that are
assessed to be the most important in terms of each country’s
specific circumstances.

"In contrast, the more recent publications have devoted
considerable attention to the limitations of existing international
agreements in addressing the climate change. In fact, there are
no authoritative assessments of the UNFCCC or its Kyoto
Protocol that assert that these agreements have succeeded — or
will succeed without changes — in fully solving the climate
problem. As its name implies, the UNFCCC was designed as
a broad framework, and the Kyoto Protocol’s first commitment
period for 2008-2012 has been its first detailed step. Both the
Convention and the Kyoto Protocol include provisions for
further steps as necessary.
"	Text
"The context of and reasons for an international agreement
were relatively well covered in IPCC (2001). The authors of more
recent reports cite the reasons presented in older publications
for the necessity of agreements — namely, the global nature of
the problem and the fact that no single country emits more than
approximately 20% of global emissions. This situation means
that successful solutions will need to engage multiple countries.
Similarly, the fact that no one sector is responsible for more
than about 25% of global emissions (the largest sector is that of
electricity generation and heat production at 24% of the global,
six-gas total; see Baumert et a/., 2005a) implies that no single
sector will be uniquely required to act.

e The lack of an explicit long- -term goal means countries do
not have a clear direction for national and international
policy (see, for example, Corfee-Morlot and Hohne, 2003);

e The targets are inadequately stringent (Den Elzen and
Meinshausen, 2005, who argue for more stringent targets);

e The agreements do not engage an adequate complement
of countries (see Baumert et al. 1999, who suggest a need
to engage developing as well as developed countries, or
Bohringer and Welsch 2006, who suggest that with the US
withdrawal, the Kyoto Protocol’s effect is reduced to zero);

e The agreements are too expensive (Pizer, 1999, 2002);

provisions (Victor, 2001; Aldy et al., 2003);

  
"	List
"The majority of elements identified in the literature draw on
existing multilateral agreements, in particular, the UNFCCC and
its Kyoto Protocol. Agreements related to climate change, but
not specifically focused on GHG mitigation, are less extensively
analysed in the climate literature. These include energy policy
and technology agreements (see, for example, publications
the IEA evaluating their “Implementing Agreements”) and
the evaluation of VAs with the auto sector (see, for example,
Sauer et al., 2005 on the European Automobile Manufacturers
Association (ACEA) agreement between the European, Japanese
and Korean auto manufacturers). Based on the literature in
Table 13.2, it is possible to derive some common elements of
international climate change agreements. These are listed in
Box 13.6, and expanded upon in the section below.
"	Text
"Reviews of the current agreements take several forms.
Some (e.g. Depledge, 2000) provide detailed article-by-article
reviews of the existing agreements, seeking to interpret the
legal language as well as to provide a better understanding of
their historical derivations. In this manner, they offer insight
into how future agreements might be developed. Other studies
assess the effect of the emission reductions required by the
Kyoto Protocol on global GHG concentrations and conclude
that although the effect is currently small (Manne and Richels,
1999), it may be large in the future as present-day emission
reductions set the stage for future reduction efforts, which
would not have happened otherwise (Héhne and Blok, 2006).
Some researchers (e.g. Cooper, 2001; Michaelowa ef al.,
2005a) evaluate the basic underpinnings of the two climate
agreements, looking at problems associated with establishing
binding targets and differentiating between countries as well
as difficulties in operationalizing the concept of emissions
markets. These kinds of assessments — by far the most common
— not only assess current limitations but usually proceed to put
forth counter-arguments, outline improvements that should be
made and propose alternative mechanisms for addressing the
climate problem. See the following sections for responses and
alternatives to solving the climate problem.

"Participation: All agreements are undertaken between specific groups of participants. Some have a global scope while
others focus on a more limited set of parties (e.g. regional in nature or limited to arrangements between private sector
partners). Obligations can be uniform across participants, or differentiated among them.
"	Text
"Goals: Most agreements establish objectives that implementation is supposed to achieve. In the climate context, a variety
of goals have been proposed, including those related to emissions reductions, stabilization of GHG concentrations, avoiding
“dangerous” interference with climate, technology transfer and sustainable development. Goals can be set at varying degrees
of specificity.
"	Text
"Other elements: Many (although not all) agreements contain additional elements, including, for example, “principles” and
other preambular language. These can serve to provide context and guidance for operational elements, although they may
be points of contention during negotiations. In addition, many agreements contain provisions for evaluating progress — with
a timetable for reviewing the adequacy of efforts and evaluating whether they need to be augmented or modified.

at 750 ppmv CO,-eq, scenario category D of Chapter 3 of this

For low stabilization goals (e.g. 450 ppmv CO)-eq, category
Al, or 550 ppmv CO,-eq, category B), short-term emission
reductions would be necessary in addition to technological
development programmes.

"Most agreements (including those on climate change such as
the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol), include specific goals to
guide the selection of actions and timing as well as the selection
of institutions. Goals can provide a common vision about both
the near-term direction and the longer term certainty that is
called for by business. In this discussion, goals are distinguished
from targets: the former are long-term and systemic, while the
latter relate to actions that are near-term and specific. Targets
are described under the ‘Targets’ section (13.3.3.4.1) below.
"	Text
"Institutions and compliance provisions: Many agreements contain provisions for establishing and maintaining supporting
institutions. These perform tasks as varied as serving as repositories for specific, agreement-related data, facilitating or
adjudicating compliance, serving as clearing houses for market transactions or information flows, to managing financial
arrangements. In addition, most agreements have provisions in case of non-compliance. These include binding and non-
binding consequences and may be facilitative or more coercive in nature.
"	Text
"Actions: All agreements call for some form of action. Actions vary widely and can include national caps or targets on
emissions, standards for certain sectors of the economy, financial payments and transfers, technology development, specific
programmes for adaptation and reporting and monitoring. The actions can be implicitly or explicitly designed to support
sustainable development. The timing for actions varies considerably, from those taking effect immediately, to ones that may

take effect only over the longer term; actions may be taken internally (within contracting Parties) or with others (both with
non-Parties as well as non-State actors).

"International regimes can incorporate goals for the short and
medium term and for the stabilization of GHG concentrations.
One option is to set a goal for long-term GHG concentrations
or a maximal temperature rise (such as the 2°C goal proposed
by the EU). Such levels might be set based on an agreement
of impacts to be avoided (see Den Elzen and Meinshausen,
2005) or on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis (see Nordhaus,
2001). A number of authors have commented on the advantages
and disadvantages of setting long-term goals. Pershing and

agreement on any ‘dangerous’ level due to political and
technical difficulties. Conversely, Corfee-Morlot and Héhne

Common but differentiated convergence: Annex | countries’ per capita emissions converge to low levels within a

Hybrid between a tax and emission trading: after the initial
allocation, an unlimited amount of additional allowances are
sold at a fixed price.

 

Buyer liability:
Victor, 2001b

If the seller of a permit did not reduce its emissions as
promised, the buyer could not claim the emission credit.
Enforcement is more reliable as buyers deal with developed
countries with more robust legal procedures.

 

Domestic hybrid trading schemes:
McKibbin and Wilcoxen, 1997; McKibbin and Wilcoxen, 2002

Two kinds of emissions permits valid only within the country of
origin. (1) long-term permits entitle the permit owner to emit

1 tC every year for a long period; permits are distributed once.
(2) Annual permits allow 1 tC to be emitted in a single year.

An unlimited number of these permits are given out at a fixed
price (price cap). Compliance is based on either unit.

 

Allowance purchase fund:
Bradford, 2004

Countries contribute to an international fund that buys/retires
emission reduction units. Countries can sell reductions below
their BAU levels.

Dynamic targets:

Hargrave et al/., 1998; Lutter, 2000; Miller et a/., 2001; Bouille
and Girardin, 2002; Chan-Woo, 2002; Lisowski, 2002; Ellerman

Furstenberger, 2003; Jotzo and Pezzey, 2005; Philibert, 2005b;
Pizer, 2005b; Kolstad, 2006

Targets are expressed as dynamic variables — including as a
function of the GDP (“intensity targets”) or variables of physical
production (e.g. emissions per tonne of steel produced).

 

Dual targets, target range or target corridor:
Philibert and Pershing, 2001; Kim and Baumert, 2002

Two emission targets are defined: (1) a lower “selling target”
that allows allowance sales if national emissions fall below
a certain level; (2) a higher “buying target” that requires the
purchase of allowances if a certain level is exceeded.

 

Dual intensity targets:
Kim and Baumert, 2002

A combination of intensity targets and dual targets.

 

“No lose”, “non-binding”, one-way targets:
Philibert, 2000

Emission rights can be sold if the target is reached, while no
additional emission rights would have to be bought if target
is not met. Allocations are made at a BAU level or at a level
below BAU. Structure offers incentives to participate for
countries not prepared to take on full commitments but still
interested in joining the global trading regime.

 

Growth targets, headroom allowances, premium allocation:
Frankel, 1999; Stewart and Wiener, 2001; Viguier, 2004

Participation of major developing countries is encouraged by

unambitious allocations relative to their likely BAU emissions.

To ensure benefit to the atmosphere, a fraction of each permit
sold can be banked and definitely removed.

Goldberg and Baumert, 2004

A commitment to reduce GHG emission levels below projected

Negotiation process and treaty structure

 

Bottom-up or multi-facet approach, pledge
(with review) and review:
Reinstein, 2004; Yamaguchi and Sekine, 2006

Each country creates its own initial proposal relating to what it might be able
to commit to. Individual actions accumulate one by one. The collective effect
of proposals is periodically reviewed for adequacy and — if necessary —
additional rounds of proposals are undertaken.

 

Portfolio approach:
Benedick, 2001

A portfolio including: emission reduction policies, government research/
development, technology standards and technology transfer.

 

A flexible framework:
PEW, 2005

A portfolio including: aspirational long-term goals, adaptation, targets, trading,
policies, and technology cooperation.

 

Orchestra of treaties:
Sugiyama et al., 2003

A system of separate treaties among like-minded countries (emission markets,
zero emission technology, climate-wise development) and among all parties to
UNFCCC (monitoring, information, funding).

Multiple case studies of coordinated measures, emissions tax, tradable
emission permits and a hybrid system in industrialized countries to learn by

by emissions trading) can allocate the gains from cooperation

Chander and Tulkens, 1995; Germain et al., 1998; Germain et
al., 2003). Eykmans and Finus (2003) note that much of the
literature focuses on a ‘grand (all party) coalition, analyses
stability in terms of the aggregate payoff to coalitions and rests
on very strong assumptions about implicit punishment of any
free-riding countries.’ A more extensive discussion of the issues
of free-riding is contained in Chapter 10 of the TAR.

"Participation in the agreement can be static?2, or itmay change
dynamically over time. In the latter case, states can “graduate”
from one tier of commitments to the next. Graduation can be
linked to the meeting of quantitative thresholds for certain
parameters (or combinations of parameters) that have been
predefined in the agreement, such as emissions, cumulative
emissions, GDP per capita, relative contribution to temperature
increase or other measures of development, such as the human
development index (see Berk and Den Elzen (2001), Gupta
(1998, 2003a) and Hohne et al. (2003) for a review of per-capita
emissions thresholds; Criqui et a/. (2003) and Michaelowa et
al. (2005b) for discussion of a composite index using the sum
of per-capita emissions and per-capita GDP and Torvanger et
al. (2005) for further composite indices). Qualitative thresholds
such as adherence to certain country groupings (OECD,
Economies in Transition) are already in use. Ott et al. (2004)
combine quantitative and qualitative thresholds. Thresholds
can be derived from agreed-upon GHG concentration targets or
global emissions paths or be based on other parameters, such as
willingness or capacity to pay.

"Some have argued that an international agreement needs to
include at least the major emitters to be effective, since the largest
15 countries (the EU25 is considered here to be one country)
produce as much as 80% of global GHG emissions (Baumert
et al., 2005a; PEW, 2005; Stewart and Weiner, 2003; Torvanger
et al., 2005; Schmidt et al., 2006). A similar approach has been
taken by authors comparing climate change agreements to other
multilateral instruments, including disarmament treaties and
the Antarctic Treaty (see Murase, 2002a). In these analyses, the
authors assert that success can only be achieved if the major
stakeholders act. Thus, for example, a nuclear disarmament
treaty would be meaningless if it was not ratified by those
States with nuclear weapons, even if it was ratified by the 180
non-nuclear States. By analogy, a climate change treaty is
meaningful only if commitments are adopted and implemented
by the major emitters — noting that the benefits of participation
accrue to all countries, including those not taking part in the
agreement. Murase (2002a) suggests that a future regime
after 2012 thus needs to include key countries or groups such
as the USA, EU, Japan, China, India, Korea, Mexico, Brazil,
Indonesia, South Africa and Nigeria.

broad spectrum of parameters and assumptions that influence
these results, such as population, GDP development of
individual countries or regions, global emission pathways
that lead to climate stabilization (including overshooting the

"Some authors (see, for example, Muller, 2002; Jaeger,
2003) suggest that a climate regime is not exclusively about
mitigation but that it also encompasses adaptation and, as such,
far wider arrays of countries are vulnerable to climate and must
be included in any agreement. Further, several authors (e.g.
Meira Filho and Gonzales, 2000; Pan, 2005) argue that even
if the majority of emissions are the responsibility of only a few
nations, all countries must share the commitments to reduce
these for reasons of equity and fairness (recognizing that such
actions should be differentiated according to responsibility and
capability). Other rationales for global engagement are also
used, including that if only some major countries participate,
the emissions of non-participating countries could increase by
the migration of emission-intensive industries. Therefore, most
proposals aim to provide incentives for countries to participate.
Some aim at pull incentives, such as temporary over-allocation
or no regret structures; others mention push incentives, such
as trade sanctions or border tax adjustments (Kuik, 2003;
Biermann and Brohm, 2005).

Under regime designs for low and medium concentration
stabilization levels (i.e. 450 and 550 ppm CO,-eq, category
A and B; see Chapter 3, Table 3.10) GHG emissions from
developed countries would need to be reduced substantially
during this century. For low and medium stabilization
levels, developed countries as a group would need to
reduce their emissions to below 1990 levels in 2020 (on the
order of —10% to 40% below 1990 levels for most of the
considered regimes) and to still lower levels by 2050 (40%
to 95% below 1990 levels), even if developing countries
make substantial reductions. The reduction percentages for
individual countries vary between different regime designs
and parameter settings and may be outside of this range. For
high stabilization levels, reductions would have to occur,
but at a later date (see Box 13.7).

Under most of the considered regime designs for low and
medium stabilization levels, the emissions from developing
countries need to deviate — as soon as possible — from what
we believe today would be their baseline emissions, even
if developed countries make substantial reductions. For
the advanced developing countries, this occurs by 2020
(mostly Latin America, Middle East and East Asia). For
high stabilization levels, deviations from the reference level
are necessary only at a later date.

Reaching lower levels of GHG concentrations requires
earlier reductions and faster participation compared to
higher concentrations.

For many countries, the overall target set is critical; it dictates
the emissions reduction requirements more specifically than
does the approach chosen to meet that target.

The wide diversity of approaches means that not all
countries participate under all regimes — even if an identical
concentration target is achieved. Obviously, required
national actions differ enormously, depending on whether a
country participates in a system. However, the difference in
reductions required between the various approaches is small
for participating countries.

Regional abatement costs are largely dependent on the

The total global costs does not vary significantly for the

the degree of participation in emission trading (how and
when allowances are allocated). If, for example, some
major emitting regions do not participate in the reductions

participating regions may be higher (see also Chapter 3, e.g.

"Several studies have gone one step further and have, based
on emission allocations, calculated emission reduction costs
and possible trades of emission allowances at a regional
level for different concentration or temperature stabilization
targets (Criqui et al., 2003; WBGU, 2003; Bollen et al., 2004;
Bohringer and Welsch, 2004, 2006; Bohringer and Léschel,
2005; den Elzen and Lucas, 2005; den Elzen et al., 2005c;
Persson et al., 2006). Researchers have also analysed a large
variety of system designs. With cost analysis even more
assumptions are relevant, such as detailed assumptions on
emission reduction costs per sector and region. Costs have been
calculated using a variety of models, ranging from those with
detailed sectoral representation focussing on the technological
aspects to macroeconomic models focussing on the economy
as a whole. How (and what) costs are calculated plays a role.
Some studies present annual direct mitigation costs (only direct
abatement costs) or energy costs, such as mitigation costs and
costs of losses of fossil fuel exports or gains from increased
exports of biofuels. Other studies present full macro-economic
costs, calculated as (cumulative) GDP losses in a specific target
year. The cumulative impact of climate policies on GDP may be
lower than expected from the annual abatement costs levels due
to the fact that climate policy leads mostly to the substitution of
investments and activities and much less to an overall reduction
of the GDP. The conclusions of these studies on costs can be
summarized as follows:

of the participating countries (assuming targets will be met).
These targets can also be reached in a flexible manner across

"Participating countries make proposals (pledges) for
individual reductions on a bottom-up basis. This approach
has the risk that proposed reductions may not be adequate to
lead to the desired stabilization levels.

A common formula can be agreed upon for determining
the emission targets. This rule could lead to reduction
percentages for each individual country (which could
subsequently be modified by negotiations).

An overall target can be given to a group of countries, with
the group deciding internally on how to share the target
amongst the participants. This approach has been applied
to the EU for the purpose of the Kyoto Protocol. It could, in
principle, also be applied to any other group of countries.

"Additional understanding comes from the political science
literature which emphasizes the importance of analysing the full
range of factors bearing on decisions by nation states, including
domestic pressures from the public and affected interest groups,
the role of norms and the contribution of NGOs (environment,
business and labour) to the negotiation processes. Studies of the
European Acid Rain Regime have revealed, for example, that
although agreements on an ambitious target can serve as a driver
for policy implementation, they may not necessarily result in a
good environmental consequence if the countries involved do
not have the capacity to comply with what they have committed
themselves to in good faith (Victor, 1998). While such case
study-based analyses yield conclusions that are dependent on
the choice of cases and the manner in which the analysis is
carried out, they can provide insights which are more accessible
to policymakers than more quantitative economic analyses.

"Many authors have raised concerns that the absolute or fixed
targets may be too rigid and cap economic growth (Philibert and
Pershing, 2001; Héhne et al., 2003; Bodansky, 2004). To address
these concerns, a number of more flexible national emission
targets have been proposed (see alternative types of emission
targets in Table 13.2). These options aim at maintaining the
advantages of international emissions trading while providing
more flexibility to countries to avoid extremely high costs and,
thereby, potentially allowing for the adoption of more stringent
targets. However, this flexibility reduces the certainty that a
given emission level will be reached. Thus, there is a trade-off
between costs and certainty in achieving an emissions level (see
Jotzo and Pezzey, 2005). Other disadvantages that have been
mentioned are adding to the complexity of the system or, in the
case of intensity targets, the difficulty in coping with economic
recession as well as the potential for creating ambiguity for
market investors.

"would incur high costs relative to what might occur in the
reference or baseline cases. Conversely, if convergence were
to occur by the middle of the century, developed countries
would incur higher costs relative to what they might incur
in a reference or baseline case (see Nakicenovic and Riahi,
2003; den Elzen et al., 2005a; Persson et al., 2006).
Abatement costs (only costs from reducing emissions)
as a percentage of GDP vary significantly by region for
allocation schemes that ultimately lead to convergence in
per capita emissions by the middle of this century. The costs
are above the global average for the Middle East and the
Russian Federation, including surrounding countries, and —
to a lesser extent — for Latin America. The costs are near the
world average for the OECD regions and below the world
average for China. The other developing regions, such as
Africa and South-Asia (India), experience low costs or even
gains as a result of financial transfers from emission trading.
(Criqui et al., 2003; den Elzen and Lucas, 2005).

In addition to the abatement costs of reducing emissions,
other costs arise from changes in international trade. Fossil
fuel-exporting regions are also likely to be affected by
losses in coal and oil exports compared to the baseline,
while some regions could experience increased bio-energy
exports (i.e. the Russian Federation and South America)
(see Nakicenovic and Riahi, 2003; van Vuuren et al., 2003;
Persson et al., 2006; and also Chapter 11).

The economic impacts in terms of welfare changes show
a similar pattern for different allocation schemes. For
example, allocation schemes based on current emissions
(sovereignty) lead to welfare losses for the developing
countries. Allocation schemes based on a per capita
convergence lead to welfare gains for developing countries,
without leading to excessive burdens for industrialized
countries. (Bohringer and Welsch, 2004)

The overall value of the global carbon market was over 10 billion
US$ in 2005, and in the first quarter of 2006 the transaction

The most advanced ETS is that developed by the EU. While
this system is an international one, it bears many of the
characteristics of a national programme, with oversight by the
European Commission and a centralized regulatory and review
mechanism (see Box 13.4 for details, including those on trading
prices and volumes). A larger global system of international
trading is slowly developing through emission credits generated
by the project-based mechanisms?3. Theoretically, a fully
global ETS would provide market players and policymakers
with information thus far absent from decision-making: the
actual, unfettered, global cost of GHG mitigation in a range
of economic activities. In this context, at the international
level, such a regime would mirror the information provided by
national trading programmes at a global scale.

"Various authors have analysed the size of the allowance
surplus of the countries in transition, barriers to accessing
allowances, the potential market power of cartels and links to
energy security. Such surpluses can alter the overall costs of
compliance with the Kyoto commitments — but only if trade
in such surplus allowances is undertaken. Victor et al. (2001a)
estimated the joint Russian and Ukrainian surplus at 3.7 billion
tCO, for the entire commitment period 2008-2012. Berkhout
and Smith (2003) estimate the surplus level of the former
Soviet Union through to 2030 and state that it could only cover
half of an assumed 30% reduction target for a 28-member state
EU. Golub and Strukova (2004) see the Russian surplus as
being up to 3 billion tCO,, arguing that due to barriers in the
Russian capital market, forward trading with OECD countries
represents the only opportunity to raise initial capital to mobilize
no-regret and low-cost GHG reductions. Maeda (2003) shows
that permits for surplus emissions in the international emissions
trading regime may affect the economic efficiency of the Kyoto
mechanism and suggests that considerable market power exerted
by sellers could affect the price (e.g. if all of the economies in
transition form a cartel, if Ukraine forms a cartel with Russia or
even if Russia acts alone). Kuik (2003) sees a trade-off between
economic efficiency, energy security and carbon dependency
with respect to the EU acquisition of Russian and Ukrainian
assigned amount units. One proposal for reducing concerns over
trading in surplus allowances is that of the ‘Green Investment
Scheme’, in which revenues from sales of surplus allowances are
spent on national policies, programmes and projects to further
reduce emissions; this option is explained further below.

"The coverage of forestry and forest-related projects is a
contentious issue under the CDM. The problems primarily relate
to the impermanence of the forest and to leakage to other regions.
Dutschke (2002) suggests leasing CDM credits to address the
non-permanence of forestry sinks. The CDM has addressed the
issue of non-permanence through the creation of separate CDM
credits, which are called temporary CERs. According to Nelson
and de Jong (2003), development priorities can be lost. This is
illustrated by the case of a forestry project in Chiapas in which
Mexico shifted from a development emphasis with multiple
species to two species when the focus changed to carbon sales
by individual farmers. Data (or its scarcity) as well as price
uncertainty also pose problems. Véhringer (2004) notes that
establishing historical deforestation rates is a major problem

"If a project is additional, the next step is to determine a
‘baseline’ — the emissions that would have occurred if the project
had not taken place. One potential risk is the overestimation of
baseline emissions, which is a major problem as all participants
profit from an overestimate as there is then no incentive to
correct it. Stringent rules and modalities are required for
determining baselines affecting the efficient processing of the
CDM (Bailey et al., 2001). Fischer (2006) argues that due to
pressure from industry, rules for standard emission rates are
likely to be systematically biased to over-allocation and also
risk creating inefficient investment incentives. Alternatively,
Broekhoff (2004) focuses on costs and efficiency, arguing
that the availability of data and the level of data aggregation
determine to a large extent the cost of deriving multi-project
baselines. Other authors examine specific baseline issues in the
energy sector, particularly the use of models, the need to consider
size, vintage, generation type and operational characteristics
and issues relating to technology and sectoral approaches (see
Fichtner et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2001; Spalding-Fecher et al.,

R&D, sectoral policies and policies that modify foreign direct

"Sectoral commitments have the advantage of being able to
be specified on a narrower basis than total national emissions.
Baumert et al. (2005b) consider specific options in aluminium,
cement, iron and steel, transportation and electricity generation

approaches, considerable precedent already exists for agreement
both between companies and by governments. Sectoral
approaches provide an additional degree of policy flexibility
and make the comparison of efforts between countries within
a sector a relatively easy process — although comparing efforts
across sectors may be difficult (see Philibert, 2005a). An
additional disadvantage to sectoral approaches is that they may
create economic inefficiency. Trading across all sectors will
inherently be at a lower cost than trading only within a single
sector.

"Perhaps the most critical issue in the context of the viability
of the CDM over the longer term is whether there will be an
ongoing price signal that encourages both emission reduction
commitments and a market demand — over the longer term.
This will clearly depend on the shape of both international
agreements and evolving national programmes that might
support project offsets. Independent of the market demand
issues, an important suggestion to enhance the CDM relates to
improving the sustainable development benefits of a CDM. One
proposal*¢ for doing this is the ‘Gold Standard’, which calls for
enhanced environmental assessment, stakeholder consultations
and the use of a qualitative sustainability matrix, expanding the
CDM regime to allow programmes and policies to be credited
—a concept elaborated on in a decision by the first meeting of
the Kyoto Parties in 2005, and analysed by Ellis (2006) — and
extending CDM project incentives beyond 2012.

"A number of researchers have suggested that sectoral
approaches may provide an appropriate framework for post-
Kyoto agreements (see sectoral approaches in Table 13.2).
Under such a system, specified targets could be set, starting
with specific sectors or industries that are particularly important,
politically easier to address, globally homogeneous and/or
relatively insulated from competition with other sectors. Such
an approach may be binding (e.g. such as an agreement in the
International Civil Aviation Organization) or voluntary (such
as an agreement through the International Standardization
Organization). Targets may be fixed or dynamic, and ‘no-
lose’, binding or non-binding (Philibert and Pershing, 2001;
Samaniego and Figures, 2002; Bodansky, 2004). Bosi and Ellis

"Joint Implementation has been much less extensively
researched than the CDM. Its later start date and unclear
international rules (for example, the “second track’ rules were
only agreed upon in October 2006) have generated considerable
uncertainty with regard to implementation. Transactions under
JI are seen as both cumbersome and beset with institutional
obstacles (Korppoo, 2005). In addition, several authors have
argued that JI projects will potentially be ‘double counted’ —
given credit under both the project mechanism as well as under
the rules for EU ETS. A number of proposals have been made to
address this issue. Koch and Michaelowa (1999) and Moe et al.
(2003) have suggested a “Green Investment Scheme’ (GIS) in
which revenues from sales of Assigned Amount Units (AAU)
are allocated to projects that reduce GHG emissions. Blyth and
Baron (2003) suggest that the scale of a GIS in Russia could
reach as much as € 1.25-3.5 billion per annum. This is a very
approximate figure and depends on the balance of supply and
demand and the prevailing allowance price. Fernandez and
Michaelowa (2003) discuss the impact of defining the ‘acquis
communautaire’ as the baseline for JI projects in the new EU
Member States and stress the need to establish a predictable
legal framework in the host countries, while Van der Gaast
(2002) sees a reduced scope for JI in Eastern Europe due to the
‘acquis’ which could also be increased by using a GIS.

the disputed trade measure stems from a treaty obligation or a national policy. Neither the UNFCCC nor the Kyoto Protocol
has been formulated in language that can reasonably be interpreted to require or authorize a trade measure as a strategy to

of problems with Cooper’s proposals, including issues of
fairness (whether developed and developing countries should
have identical tax rates given the relative welfare and relative
responsibilities), whether any incentive exists for developed
countries to adopt a tax and how to manage gaming behaviour
(in which a government may change tax codes to neutralize
its effects or to benefit certain economic sectors). Additional
criticism of a common tax structure comes from the modelling
community: Babiker et a/. (2003) note that while an equal
marginal abatement cost across countries is economically
efficient, it may not be politically feasible in the context of
existing tax distortions. They also note that many countries
which currently apply such taxes have exempted certain

"Two examples help demonstrate the range of possible pitfalls:

In 1998, Japan introduced the ‘top-runner’ programme as part of its domestic efforts to implement the Kyoto Protocol.
This legislation was intended to ensure that automobiles and other manufactured products would be more energy
efficient; it required new appliance and manufactured goods be as efficient as the ‘top-runner’ in the same category. The
legislation raised concern among other automobile-exporting countries, most notably the USA and the EU, which feared
that the measures might have adverse effects on their exports; consequently, the latter suggested that the legislation
was not compatible with WTO rules on free trade. Conversely, according to Yamaguchi (2004), the Japanese legislation
provides for objective standards that would be applied equally to domestic and imported cars and, accordingly, there
would be no discriminatory treatment as a matter in law. After discussions between all parties over several years, no
formal appeal was ever submitted under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) or the Technical Barriers to
Trade (TBT) Agreement (see Murase, 2004).

Murase (2002b) considers potential conflicts between the use of the Kyoto Protocol’s project-based flexibility mechanisms
(CDM and Jl) and various trade agreements. Inasmuch as project-based offsets represent foreign direct investment
(FDI), they may run counter to both the GATT and Subsidies and Countervailing Measures Agreement as well as the
common practice application of the Trade Related Investment Measures (TRIMs) and Agriculture Agreements. Adding
an additional point of complexity, Werksman et a/. (2001) suggest that the effective functioning of the CDM may require
investor discrimination in a manner prohibited by the Most Favored Nation (MFN) clause of international investment
agreements.

proposal could potentially be environmentally effective,
depending on the payoffs to the cooperative R&D efforts and
the rate of technology deployment, Barrett notes that the system
would neither be efficient nor cost-effective, not least because
the technology standards would not apply to every sector of
the global economy and may entail some technological lock-in.
However, Barrett assumes that if standards are set in enough
key countries, a ‘tipping effect’ is created which ultimately
would lead to widespread global adoption. In reviewing
Barrett’s assessment, Philibert (2004) expresses doubts as to

both protect endangered species and the climate. Similarly,
meetings of Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)

In its standard form, such an approach would be domestic and

that simultaneous SDPAMS pledges (and possibly harmonized

the overall scale of the GEF is small.43 Funding is given to five
project types, namely renewable energy, energy efficiency,
sustainable transportation, adaptation, low GHG _ energy
technologies and enabling activities. Hall (2002) analysed the
GEF portfolio and noted the focus on incremental, one-time

reflected in sovereign credit ratings, can be compounded further
by including new and emerging technologies. International or
regional financing institutions can play a critical role in lowering
the risk and leveraging private finance into the sector. MDBs
have responded to this challenge by establishing several new
initiatives. For example, the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development’s (EBRD) new Sustainable Energy Initiative
was launched in May 2006 to address the wasteful and polluting
use of energy. The EBRD plans to invest up to € 1.5 billion in
energy efficiency, renewables and clean energy projects over
the next 3 years, which could lead to up to € 5 billion of total
investment. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) launched
the Energy Efficiency Initiative (EEI) in July 2005, the core
objective of which is to expand ADB’s investments in energy
efficiency projects (including renewable energy), with an
indicative annual lending target of | billion US$ between 2008

development. The IFC has revised its performance standards
in 2006 to require the reporting of GHG emissions for projects
with both direct and indirect emissions of greater than 100,000
tonnes annually. The standards also require the consideration of
alternatives or improvements to the energy efficiency of energy
intensive projects (see http://www.ifc.org/ifcext/enviro.nsf/

to Yamin and Depledge (2004), the Marrakesh Accords have
been partially successful in bringing some additional coherence,
coordination and prioritization into the process of capacity

"There are two schools of thought regarding the appropriate
response to non-compliance contemplated under the Kyoto
Protocol (see Murase, 2002b). One view advocates ‘soft’
compliance-management, which favours primarily facilitative
and promotional approaches by rendering assistance to non-
compliant States; those holding this view often refer to ‘the
non-compliance procedure’ used under the Montreal Protocol.
The other view takes a ‘hard’ enforcement approach in order to
coerce compliance by imposing penalties or sanctions on non-
complying parties. Financial penalties and economic or trade
sanctions have been proposed along these lines. However, it
has been suggested that such measures could be in conflict with
WTO/GATT rules on trade liberalization (Mitchell, 2005).

agreed under Kyoto is viewed as only partially fulfilling these
criteria. For example, Nentjes and Klaassen (2004) note that the
obligation to fully restore any excess emissions in subsequent
periods does not exclude the option of postponing restoration
forever. If such an outcome occurs, the trading mechanisms
under the Protocol may be substantially weakened. However,
it is pointed out that introducing adversarial elements (such as
sanctions) into the system are highly undesirable in view of the
fact that the Kyoto Protocol currently covers only one third of
the total GHG emissions of the world (Murase, 2005).

"In his review of the Kyoto Protocol’s compliance mechanism,
Barrett (2003) argues that failure to comply over two compliance
periods can essentially be equivalent to indefinitely postponing
action: A country that is found in non-compliance in the first
period has to make up the difference plus 30% in the next
period. If it fails to achieve the latter target as well, it will have
to make up the difference in the period thereafter — a process
that can continue indefinitely. Perhaps the most important
point in his proposal is that if countries feel that they cannot
easily meet their commitments, they will negotiate for higher
allowances in the period thereafter — or even withdraw from
the agreement entirely. He also notes that the Protocol does not
have any procedures to deal with countries that decide not to
cooperate with the rules.

independent treaties on equal footing, neither can automatically
be given the right to make a decision in the case of a conflict. As
a result, a number of authors (e.g. Esty, 2001; Murase, 2002b)

consensus, successful agreements are often relatively simple and

While there has been no comprehensive critique of the proposals
in Table 13.3 in terms of their institutional feasibility, the latter
clearly varies widely — for example, in terms of the extent to
which they try to accommodate national circumstances and
different levels of technical sophistication. Hence, the feasibility

"An additional critical element in the effectiveness of an
international agreement is that of the implementation context:
The relevant literature shows that agreements tend to be more
successful in countries with both a high level of domestic
awareness and resources and a strong institutional and legal
framework and where there is clear political will. Where global
agreements are designed using only blue-print approaches to
instruments, these instruments may ultimately ignore the specific
cultural and institutional contexts within which they are designed
to function and may actually not work as well (see conclusions of
the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005). Agreements that
promote ancillary objectives, such as reductions in ordinary air
pollution levels, also have a higher chance of success.

"Perhaps the most politically charged issue in international
negotiations is that of equity. Whether a system of national
emission targets within an international agreement can be
conducive to social development and equity depends on
participation and the initial allocation of emission rights.
For example, Pan (2005) suggests that all countries should
participate — but that emissions associated with basic needs
should be exempt from limits, while emissions associated with
luxury activities should be constrained. Conversely, Gupta
and Bhandari (2003) suggest that in the initial stages of an
agreement, obligations should only be assigned to a limited set
of (wealthier) parties. Exemptions to sectors or countries and
modifications to the allocation of obligations can help address
equity issues.

institutions. The establishment of international institutions to
manage coordinated policies and measures or development-

sector international institutions exist (e.g., the Aluminium
Institute, which has set targets for GHG reductions in aluminium

have such institutional arrangements. Similarly, while there are
institutions designed to promote development (e.g., the Bretton

their portfolios (see Maurer and Bhandari, 2000). Kanie (2006)
argues that while the Kyoto Protocol will remain the core of the
institutional system, a network will ultimately be both necessary

development goals or environmental stewardship policies
(Margolick and Russell, 2001), it is often difficult to separate
these goals from economic motives (Kolk and Pinske, 2004).
Less controversial is the notion that companies adopt voluntary
initiatives to create financial value in one form or another (Lyon
and Maxwell, 2004).

"Levy and Newell (2005) describe how the business
sector, sometimes in partnership with NGOs, has initiated
environmental certification or standardization regimes to fulfill a
quasi-governmental role or to augment the role of governments.
One of the most widely-used examples of this type of standard
setting is the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, an initiative organized
by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development
(WBCSD) and the World Resources Institute (WRI) to develop
an internationally accepted accounting and reporting standard
for GHGs (WRI/WBCSD, 2004). The WRI/WBCSD reporting
standard has been used by corporations, NGOs and government
voluntary programmes. The International Standards Organization
(ISO), based on the WRI/WBCSD, has adopted standards for
the reporting of GHGs at the company and project level.5!
"	Text
"Companies may also adopt environmental initiatives to appeal
to green consumers, environmentally conscious stakeholders or
even their own employees. Reinhardt (1998) discusses how this
approach can take the form of companies differentiating their
products by their environmental performance. Other companies
have identified market opportunities for new products from
potential GHG gas regimes (Reinhardt and Packard, 2001;
Kolk and Pinske, 2005). In terms of the composition of the
stakeholders, Maxwell et al. (2000) find that firms located in
US states with a higher per capita membership in environmental
organizations had more rapid reductions of toxic emissions.
Margolick and Russell (2001) and Reinhardt (2000) report that
corporate managers cited employee retention and recruitment
as reasons for taking voluntary action.
"	Text
"Voluntary corporate-wide emissions targets for GHGs have
become particularly popular. For example, Hoffman (2005) finds
that as many as 60 US corporations have adopted corporate GHG
emissions reduction targets and that some of these companies
have participated in one of several partnership programmes run
by NGOs (see Box 13.9). Under many of these programmes,
companies develop a corporate GHG inventory and adopt an
emission target. These targets take different forms, including
absolute targets and intensity targets based on emissions or energy
use per unit of production or sales (Margolick and Russell, 2001;
King et al., 2004). Corporate targets have also been implemented
with internal trading systems, such as those operated by British
Petroleum (Margolick and Russell, 2001; Akhurst et a/., 2003)
and Petroleos Mexicana (PEMEX) (Bygrave, 2004).
"	Text
"There are both political and non-political drivers of corporate
voluntary environmental action. Political drivers include a desire
to pre-empt or influence future regulation. For example, trade
associations in 30 countries have sponsored codes of management
practices, the objectives of which are partly intended to forestall
the imposition of government mandates (Nash and Ehrenfeld,
1996). Alternatively, corporations may adopt voluntary initiatives
to influence future regulation in ways that improve their strategic
positions. By adopting environmental technologies or other
strategies ahead of regulatory mandates, corporations can signal
to regulators that these alternatives are practical or relatively
cost-effective (Reinhardt, 1999). Hoffman (2005) finds that some
companies have adopted internal emissions trading schemes or
GHG measurement programmes to gain expertise that will help
them influence future national or international policies. A related
motivation for voluntary action is the desire to manage the risks of
future regulations by taking action that would increase profitability
or protect a company’s competitive position in the event of future
regulatory mandates (Margolick and Russell, 2001).

Why has the application of policies been so modest?

Why is the global community not on a faster implementation

Why have — at the very least — hedging strategies not
emerged in many more countries?

Is the scale of the problem too large for current
institutions?

Is there a lack of information on potential impacts or on

"In addition to international carbon markets, there are other
frameworks that facilitate interactions between private, sub-
national, and non-governmental initiatives and national and
international climate change efforts. For example, NGOs, private
companies and governments have formed partnerships to help
implement the World Summit on Sustainable Development
(WSSD). These partnerships, known as ‘type II agreements’ are
self-organized and are formed as voluntary cooperative initiatives
and have the common goal of integrating the economic, social
and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. To
date, more than 300 partnerships are registered. A significant
number of these partnerships are climate change-related (see
http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/partnerships/partnerships. htm).
"	Text
"One of the most important drivers of these interactions is the
development of a global GHG emission trading market. Many
of the standardization and certification efforts described above
have been designed to build institutions for the emerging GHG
market which in turn may also facilitate interactions between
sub-national initiatives and national or international climate
regimes. For example, the eight north-eastern and mid-Atlantic
states in the US Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI)
cap and trade programme will allow the use of CDM credits
and EU ETS allowances under certain circumstances (RGGI,
2005). Similarly, there has been an exploration of a possible
linkage between the NSW Greenhouse Gas abatement scheme
and the EU ETS and Kyoto mechanisms (Fowler, 2004; Betz
and MacGill, 2005).
"	Text
"One answer to these questions may lie in the complex nature
of the policy-making processes — both for climate change policy
and, even more importantly, in other areas at the national and
sub-national level. For example, some of the most significant
emissions reductions in both developed and developing countries
have occurred at this intersection of policies (e.g. the switch to
gas in the UK, the Chinese energy efficiency programmes for
energy security, the Brazilian development of a bio-fuel-driven
transport fleet, or the trend in the 1970s and 1980s toward
nuclear power). Conversely, some of the most significant
increases in emissions have been the result of non-climate policy
priorities which have overwhelmed climate mitigation efforts
(e.g. decisions in Canada to exploit the tar sands reserves, those
in Brazil to clear forests for agriculture and those in the USA to
promote coal-powered electricity generation to enhance energy
security). Assessing how these mega-decisions are made and
how they can be linked with climate change policies is the topic
of chapter 12 and may be crucial to the future.

"finding ways to eliminate the climate of ‘fear’ that prevents
actions (or more aggressive actions) and to promote a climate
of ‘opportunity’ may be crucial to moving beyond modest
steps. As outlined in other chapters of this report, the impact
of mitigation efforts on national economic growth is relatively
small, although the economic impacts differ among countries
and may be larger than the impacts of other environmental
problems. Mitigation is also more complicated as it involves
more political actors and greater levels of cooperation and/or
coordination. In this respect, better estimates of the risks, costs
and benefits of climate policies in terms of market and no-
market terms as well as ethical terms may enable governments
to make informed decisions.

be paired with positive side effects, such as increased resource-use
efficiency, reduced emissions of air pollutants associated with fossil

when the effects may be negative. Policies directed at abating air

The pilot phase for Joint Implementation, as defined in Article
4.2(a) of the UNFCCC, which allows for project activity among
developed countries (and their companies) and between developed
and developing countries (and their companies). AIJ is intended
to allow parties to the UNFCCC to gain experience in jointly
implemented projects. AIJ under the pilot phase do not lead to any
credits. Decisions remain about the future of AIJ projects and how
they may relate to the Kyoto Mechanisms. As a simple form of

Reduction in in emissions by sources or enhancement of removals by
sinks that is additional to any that would occur in the absence of
a Joint Implementation (JI) or a Clean Development Mechanism
(CDM) project activity as defined in the Kyoto Protocol Articles on
JI and CDM. This definition may be further broadened to include
financial, investment, technology, and environmental additionality.
Under financial additionality, the project activity funding is
additional to existing Global Environmental Facility, other financial
commitments of parties included in Annex I, Official Development
Assistance, and other systems of cooperation. Under investment
additionality, the value of the Emissions Reduction Unit/Certified
Emission Reduction Unit shall significantly improve the financial
or commercial viability of the project activity. Under technology
additionality, the technology used for the project activity shall
be the best available for the circumstances of the host party.
Environmental additionality refers to the environmental integrity
of the claimed amount by which greenhouse gas emissions are
reduced due to a project relative to its baseline. A project activity
is further additional, if the incentive from the sale of emission
allowances helps to overcome barriers to its implementation.

Models estimating mitigation often characterize an arbitrary carbon-
free technology (often for power generation) that becomes available
in the future in unlimited supply over the horizon of the model. This
allows models to explore the consequences and importance of a
generic solution technology without becoming enmeshed in picking
the technology. This “backstop” technology might be a nuclear
technology, fossil technology with capture and sequestration,
solar, or something as yet unimagined. The backstop technology is
typically assumed either not to currently exist, or to exist only at
higher costs relative to conventional alternatives.

“standalone” activity that is assumed not to have significant indirect
economic impacts on markets and prices (both demand and supply)
beyond the activity itself. The activity can be the implementation of
specific technical facilities, infrastructure, demand-side regulations,
information efforts, technical standards, etc. Technology level
considers a specific greenhouse-gas mitigation technology, usually
with several applications in different projects and sectors. The
literature on technologies covers their technical characteristics,
especially evidence on learning curves as the technology diffuses
and matures. Sector level considers sector policies in a “partial-
equilibrium” context, for which other sectors and the macroeconomic
variables are assumed to be as given. The policies can include
economic instruments related to prices, taxes, trade, and financing,
specific large-scale investment projects, and demand-side regulation
efforts. Macroeconomic level considers the impacts of policies on
real income and output, employment and economic welfare across
all sectors and markets. The policies include all sorts of economic
policies, such as taxes, subsidies, monetary policies, specific
investment programmes, and technology and innovation policies.
The negative of costs are benefits, and often both are considered

Primary energy (also referred to as energy sources) is the energy
embodied in natural resources (e.g., coal, crude oil, natural gas,
uranium) that has not undergone any anthropogenic conversion. It
is transformed into secondary energy by cleaning (natural gas),
refining (oil in oil products) or by conversion into electricity or heat.
When the secondary energy is delivered at the end-use facilities it
is called final energy (e.g., electricity at the wall outlet), where it
becomes usable energy (e.g., light). Daily, the sun supplies large
quantities of energy as rainfall, winds, radiation, etc. Some share
is stored in biomass or rivers that can be harvested by men. Some
share is directly usable such as daylight, ventilation or ambient heat.
Renewable energy is obtained from the continuing or repetitive
currents of energy occurring in the natural environment and includes
non-carbon technologies such as solar energy, hydropower, wind,
tide and waves and geothermal heat, as well as carbon-neutral
technologies such as biomass. Embodied energy is the energy used

Greenhouse gases effectively absorb infrared radiation, emitted
by the Earth’s surface, by the atmosphere itself due to the same

the net incoming solar radiation, whereas the Earth’s surface is kept

Greenhouse gases are those gaseous constituents of the atmosphere,
both natural and anthropogenic, that absorb and emit radiation at
specific wavelengths within the spectrum of infrared radiation
emitted by the Earth’s surface, the atmosphere and clouds. This
property causes the greenhouse effect. Water vapour (H,O), carbon
dioxide (CO,), nitrous oxide (N,O), methane (CH,) and ozone
(O;) are the primary greenhouse gases in the earth’s atmosphere.
Moreover, there are a number of entirely human-made greenhouse
gases in the atmosphere, such as the halocarbons and other chlorine-
and bromine-containing substances, dealt with under the Montreal
Protocol. Besides carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane, the
Kyoto Protocol deals with the greenhouse gases sulphur hexafluoride,
hydrofluorocarbons, and perfluorocarbons.

Market potential indicates the amount of GHG mitigation that
might be expected to occur under forecast market conditions
including policies and measures in place at the time.: It is based
on private unit costs and discount rates, as they appear in the
base year and as they are expected to change in the absence of
any additional policies and measures.

Economic potential is in most studies used as the amount of
GHG mitigation that is cost-effective for a given carbon price,
based on social cost pricing and discount rates, including
energy savings, but without most externalities. Theoretically,
it is defined as the potential for cost-effective GHG mitigation
when non-market social costs and benefits are included with
market costs and benefits in assessing the options for particular
levels of carbon prices (as affected by mitigation policies) and
when using social discount rates instead of private ones. This
includes externalities, i.e., non-market costs and benefits such
as environmental co-benefits

Technical potential is the amount by which it is possible
to reduce GHG emissions or improve energy efficiency by
implementing a technology or practice that has already been
demonstrated. No explicit reference to costs is made but
adopting ‘practical constraints’ may take into account implicit
economic considerations.

Physical potential is the theoretical (thermodynamic)
and sometimes, in practice, rather uncertain upper limit to
mitigation.

A carbon tax is a levy on the carbon content of fossil fuels. Because
virtually all of the carbon in fossil fuels is ultimately emitted as
CO,, a carbon tax is equivalent to an emission tax on each unit of
CO,-equivalent emissions. An energy tax - a levy on the energy
content of fuels - reduces demand for energy and so reduces CO,
emissions from fossil fuel use. An eco-tax is designed to influence
human behaviour (specifically economic behaviour) to follow an
ecologically benign path.

An expression of the degree to which a value is unknown (e.g. the

errors in the data to ambiguously defined concepts or terminology, or

An international carbon/emission/energy tax is a tax imposed
on specified sources in participating countries by an international
authority. The revenue is distributed or used as specified by this

sources, because imposing different rates across countries would
not be cost-effective. A tax credit is a reduction of tax in order
