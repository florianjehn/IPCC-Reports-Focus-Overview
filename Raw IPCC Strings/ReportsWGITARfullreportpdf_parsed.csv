"‘ihis report 1s the first complete assessment of the science or
climate change since Working Group I (WGI) of the IPCC
produced its second report Climate Change 1995: The Science
of Climate Change in 1996. It enlarges upon and updates the
information contained in that, and previous, reports, but
primarily it assesses new information and research, produced in
the last five years. The report analyses the enormous body of
observations of all parts of the climate system, concluding that
this body of observations now gives a collective picture of a
warming world. The report catalogues the increasing
concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases and assesses
the effects of these gases and atmospheric aerosols in altering the
radiation balance of the Earth-atmosphere system. The report
assesses the understanding of the processes that govern the
climate system and by studying how well the new generation
of climate models represent these processes, assesses the
suitability of the models for projecting climate change into the
future. A detailed study is made of human influence on climate
and whether it can be identified with any more confidence than
in 1996, concluding that there is new and stronger evidence
that most of the observed warming observed over the last 50
years is attributable to human activities. Projections of future
climate change are presented using a wide range of scenarios
of future emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols. Both
temperature and sea level are projected to continue to rise
throughout the 21st century for all scenarios studied. Finally,
the report looks at the gaps in information and understanding
that remain and how these might be addressed.

Climate change in IPCC usage refers to any change in climate over time, whether due to natural variability or as a result of human activity. This usage differs
from that in the Framework Convention on Climate Change, where climate change refers to a change of climate that is attributed directly or indirectly to
human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and that is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods

In total 122 Co-ordinating Lead Authors and Lead Authors, 515 Contributing Authors, 21 Review Editors and 420 Expert Reviewers.
Delegations of 99 IPCC member countries participated in the Eighth Session of Working Group | in Shanghai on 17 to 20 January 2001.
The IPCC Second Assessment Report is referred to in this Summary for Policymakers as the SAR.

Generally temperature trends are rounded to the nearest 0.05°C per unit time, the periods often being limited by data availability.

In general, a 5% statistical significance level is used, and a 95% confidence level.

In this Summary for Policymakers and in the Technical Summary, the following words have been used where appropriate to indicate judgmental estimates of
confidence: virtually certain (greater than 99% chance that a result is true); very likely (90-99% chance); likely (66-90% chance); medium likelihood (33-66%
chance); unlikely (10-33% chance); very unlikely (1—-10% chance); exceptionally unlikely (less than 1% chance). The reader is referred to individual chapters
for more details.

Globally, it is very likely’ that the 1990s was the warmest
decade and 1998 the warmest year in the instrumental
record, since 1861 (see Figure la).

New analyses of proxy data for the Northern Hemisphere
indicate that the increase in temperature in the 20th century
is likely’ to have been the largest of any century during the
past 1,000 years. It is also likely’ that, in the Northern
Hemisphere, the 1990s was the warmest decade and 1998
the warmest year (Figure 1b). Because less data are
available, less is known about annual averages prior to
1,000 years before present and for conditions prevailing in
most of the Southern Hemisphere prior to 1861.

On average, between 1950 and 1993, night-time daily
minimum air temperatures over land increased by about
0.2°C per decade. This is about twice the rate of increase in
daytime daily maximum air temperatures (0.1°C per decade).
This has lengthened the freeze-free season in many mid- and
high latitude regions. The increase in sea surface temperature
over this period is about half that of the mean land surface
air temperature.

@ Since the late 1950s (the period of adequate observations
from weather balloons), the overall global temperature
increases in the lowest 8 kilometres of the atmosphere and
in surface temperature have been similar at 0.1°C per decade.

@ Since the start of the satellite record in 1979, both satellite
and weather balloon measurements show that the global
average temperature of the lowest 8 kilometres of the
atmosphere has changed by +0.05 + 0.10°C per decade, but the
global average surface temperature has increased significantly
by +0.15 + 0.05°C per decade. The difference in the warming
rates is statistically significant. This difference occurs
primarily over the tropical and sub-tropical regions.

@ The lowest 8 kilometres of the atmosphere and the surface
are influenced differently by factors such as stratospheric
ozone depletion, atmospheric aerosols, and the El Nifio
phenomenon. Hence, it is physically plausible to expect that
over a short time period (e.g., 20 years) there may be
differences in temperature trends. In addition, spatial sampling
techniques can also explain some of the differences in
trends, but these differences are not fully resolved.

"Changes in climate occur as a result of both internal variability
within the climate system and external factors (both natural
and anthropogenic). The influence of external factors on
climate can be broadly compared using the concept of
radiative forcing’. A positive radiative forcing, such as that
produced by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases,
tends to warm the surface. A negative radiative forcing, which
can arise from an increase in some types of aerosols
(microscopic airborne particles) tends to cool the surface.
Natural factors, such as changes in solar output or explosive
volcanic activity, can also cause radiative forcing.
Characterisation of these climate forcing agents and their
changes over time (see Figure 2) is required to understand past
climate changes in the context of natural variations and to
project what climate changes could lie ahead. Figure 3 shows
current estimates of the radiative forcing due to increased
concentrations of atmospheric constituents and other
mechanisms.

@ The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO,) has
increased by 31% since 1750. The present CO, concentration
has not been exceeded during the past 420,000 years and
likely’ not during the past 20 million years. The current rate
of increase is unprecedented during at least the past 20,000
years.

@ About three-quarters of the anthropogenic emissions of CO,
to the atmosphere during the past 20 years is due to fossil
fuel burning. The rest is predominantly due to land-use
change, especially deforestation.

@ Currently the ocean and the land together are taking up
about half of the anthropogenic CO, emissions. On land,
the uptake of anthropogenic CO, very likely’ exceeded the
release of CO, by deforestation during the 1990s.

@ The rate of increase of atmospheric CO, concentration has
been about 1.5 ppm? (0.4%) per year over the past two
decades. During the 1990s the year to year increase varied
from 0.9 ppm (0.2%) to 2.8 ppm (0.8%). A large part of this
variability is due to the effect of climate variability (e.g., El
Nifio events) on CO, uptake and release by land and oceans.

@ The atmospheric concentration of methane (CH,) has
increased by 1060 ppb? (151%) since 1750 and continues
to increase. The present CH, concentration has not been
exceeded during the past 420,000 years. The annual
growth in CH, concentration slowed and became more
variable in the 1990s, compared with the 1980s. Slightly
more than half of current CH, emissions are anthropogenic
(e.g., use of fossil fuels, cattle, rice agriculture and
landfills). In addition, carbon monoxide (CO) emissions
have recently been identified as a cause of increasing CH,
concentration.
"	List
"@ The atmospheric concentration of nitrous oxide (N,O) has
increased by 46 ppb (17%) since 1750 and continues to
increase. The present N,O concentration has not been
exceeded during at least the past thousand years. About a
third of current N,O emissions are anthropogenic (e.g.,
agricultural soils, cattle feed lots and chemical industry).

@ Since 1995, the atmospheric concentrations of many of
those halocarbon gases that are both ozone-depleting and
greenhouse gases (e.g., CFCI, and CF,Cl,), are either
increasing more slowly or decreasing, both in response to
reduced emissions under the regulations of the Montreal
Protocol and its Amendments. Their substitute compounds
(e.g., CHF,Cl and CF,CH,F) and some other synthetic
compounds (e.g., perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur
hexafluoride (SF,)) are also greenhouse gases, and their
concentrations are currently increasing.

@ The radiative forcing due to increases of the well-mixed
greenhouse gases from 1750 to 2000 is estimated to be
2.43 Wm: 1.46 Wm from CO,; 0.48 Wm from CH,;
0.34 Wm” from the halocarbons; and 0.15 Wm from N,O.
(See Figure 3, where the uncertainties are also illustrated.)

@ The observed depletion of the stratospheric ozone (O,)
layer from 1979 to 2000 is estimated to have caused a
negative radiative forcing (-0.15 Wm). Assuming full
compliance with current halocarbon regulations, the positive
forcing of the halocarbons will be reduced as will the
magnitude of the negative forcing from stratospheric ozone
depletion as the ozone layer recovers over the 21st century.

@ The total amount of O, in the troposphere is estimated to
have increased by 36% since 1750, due primarily to
anthropogenic emissions of several O,-forming gases. This
corresponds to a positive radiative forcing of 0.35 Wm.
O, forcing varies considerably by region and responds
much more quickly to changes in emissions than the long-
lived greenhouse gases, such as CO,.

"These radiative forcings arise from changes in the atmospheric composition, alteration of surface reflectance by land use, and variation in the outpt
of the sun. Except for solar variation, some form of human activity is linked to each. The rectangular bars represent estimates of the contributions o
these forcings — some of which yield warming, and some cooling. Forcing due to episodic volcanic events, which lead to a negative forcing lasting
only for a few years, is not shown. The indirect effect of aerosols shown is their effect on the size and number of cloud droplets. A second indirect
effect of aerosols on clouds, namely their effect on cloud lifetime, which would also lead to a negative forcing, is not shown. Effects of aviation on
greenhouse gases are included in the individual bars. The vertical line about the rectangular bars indicates a range of estimates, guided by the
spread in the published values of the forcings and physical understanding. Some of the forcings possess a much greater degree of certainty than
others. A vertical line without a rectangular bar denotes a forcing for which no best estimate can be given owing to large uncertainties. The overall
level of scientific understanding for each forcing varies considerably, as noted. Some of the radiative forcing agents are well mixed over the globe,
such as CO,, thereby perturbing the global heat balance. Others represent perturbations with stronger regional signatures because of their spatial
distribution, such as aerosols. For this and other reasons, a simple sum of the positive and negative bars cannot be expected to yield the net effect
on the climate system. The simulations of this assessment report (for example, Figure 5) indicate that the estimated net effect of these perturbation:
is to have warmed the global climate since 1750. [Based upon Chapter 6, Figure 6.6]

observed small oscillations due to the | 1-year solar cycle.
Mechanisms for the amplification of solar effects on

1960 to 1991.

@ The major sources of anthropogenic aerosols are fossil fuel
and biomass burning. These sources are also linked to
degradation of air quality and acid deposition.

@ Since the SAR, significant progress has been achieved in
better characterising the direct radiative roles of different
types of aerosols. Direct radiative forcing is estimated to be
—0.4 Wm” for sulphate, —0.2 Wm for biomass burning
aerosols, —0.1 Wm for fossil fuel organic carbon and
+0.2 Wm” for fossil fuel black carbon aerosols. There is
much less confidence in the ability to quantify the total
aerosol direct effect, and its evolution over time, than that
for the gases listed above. Aerosols also vary considerably
by region and respond quickly to changes in emissions.

@ In addition to their direct radiative forcing, aerosols have an
indirect radiative forcing through their effects on clouds.
There is now more evidence for this indirect effect, which is
negative, although of very uncertain magnitude.

Reconstructions of climate data for the past 1,000 years

@ There are new estimates of the climate response to natural

have been applied. Detection and attribution studies consis-
tently find evidence for an anthropogenic signal in the
climate record of the last 35 to 50 years.

@ Simulations of the response to natural forcings alone (i.e.,
the response to variability in solar irradiance and volcanic
eruptions) do not explain the warming in the second half of
the 20th century (see for example Figure 4a). However, they
indicate that natural forcings may have contributed to the
observed warming in the first half of the 20th century.

@ The warming over the last 50 years due to anthropogenic
greenhouse gases can be identified despite uncertainties in
forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate aerosol and natural
factors (volcanoes and solar irradiance). The anthropogenic
sulphate aerosol forcing, while uncertain, is negative over
this period and therefore cannot explain the warming.
Changes in natural forcing during most of this period are
also estimated to be negative and are unlikely’ to explain

"A climate model can be used to simulate the temperature changes that occur both from natural and anthropogenic causes. The simulations
represented by the band in (a) were done with only natural forcings: solar variation and volcanic activity. Those encompassed by the band in (b) were
done with anthropogenic forcings: greenhouse gases and an estimate of sulphate aerosols, and those encompassed by the band in (c) were done with
both natural and anthropogenic forcings included. From (b), it can be seen that inclusion of anthropogenic forcings provides a plausible explanation
for a substantial part of the observed temperature changes over the past century, but the best match with observations is obtained in (c) when both
natural and anthropogenic factors are included. These results show that the forcings included are sufficient to explain the observed changes, but do
not exclude the possibility that other forcings may also have contributed. The bands of model results presented here are for four runs from the same

@ Emissions of CO, due to fossil fuel burning are virtually
certain’ to be the dominant influence on the trends in
atmospheric CO, concentration during the 21st century.

@ As the co, concentration of the atmosphere increases, ocean
and land will take up a decreasing fraction of anthropogenic
CO, emissions. The net effect of land and ocean climate
feedbacks as indicated by models is to further increase
projected atmospheric CO, concentrations, by reducing
both the ocean and land uptake of CO,,.

@ By 2100, carbon cycle models project atmospheric CO,
concentrations of 540 to 970 ppm for the illustrative SRES
scenarios (90 to 250% above the concentration of 280 ppm
in the year 1750), Figure 5b. These projections include the
land and ocean climate feedbacks. Uncertainties, especially
about the magnitude of the climate feedback from the
terrestrial biosphere, cause a variation of about —10 to
+30% around each scenario. The total range is 490 to 1260
ppm (75 to 350% above the 1750 concentration).

@ Changing land use could influence atmospheric CO,
concentration. Hypothetically, if all of the carbon released
by historical land-use changes could be restored to the
terrestrial biosphere over the course of the century (e.g., by
reforestation), CO, concentration would be reduced by 40
to 70 ppm.

scenarios, based on a number of climate models!®!!.

Temperature increases are projected to be greater than those
in the SAR, which were about 1.0 to 3.5°C based on the six
1S92 scenarios. The higher projected temperatures and the
wider range are due primarily to the lower projected
sulphur dioxide emissions in the SRES scenarios relative to
the IS92 scenarios.

The projected rate of warming is much larger than the
observed changes during the 20th century and is very likely’
to be without precedent during at least the last 10,000 years,

By 2100, the range in the surface temperature response

scenario is comparable to the range obtained from a single
model run with the different SRES scenarios.

are slightly lower, primarily due to the use of improved

projections using climate models do not exhibit a
complete shut-down of the thermohaline circulation by
2100. Beyond 2100, the thermohaline circulation could
completely, and possibly irreversibly, shut-down in either

@ Emissions of long-lived greenhouse gases (i.e., CO,, N,O,
PFCs, SF,) have a lasting effect on atmospheric
composition, radiative forcing and climate. For example,
several centuries after CO, emissions occur, about a quarter
of the increase in CO, concentration caused by these
emissions is still present in the atmosphere.

@ After greenhouse gas concentrations have stabilised, global
average surface temperatures would rise at a rate of only a
few tenths of a degree per century rather than several
degrees per century as projected for the 21st century
without stabilisation. The lower the level at which
concentrations are stabilised, the smaller the total
temperature change.

@ Global mean surface temperature increases and rising sea
level from thermal expansion of the ocean are projected to
continue for hundreds of years after stabilisation of
greenhouse gas concentrations (even at present levels),
owing to the long timescales on which the deep ocean
adjusts to climate change.

@ Ice sheets will continue to react to climate warming and
contribute to sea level rise for thousands of years after
climate has been stabilised. Climate models indicate that
the local warming over Greenland is likely’ to be one to
three times the global average. Ice sheet models project that
a local warming of larger than 3°C, if sustained for
millennia, would lead to virtually a complete melting of the
Greenland ice sheet with a resulting sea level rise of about
7 metres. A local warming of 5.5°C, if sustained for 1,000
years, would be likely’ to result in a contribution from
Greenland of about 3 metres to sea level rise.

@ Current ice dynamic models suggest that the West Antarctic
ice sheet could contribute up to 3 metres to sea level rise
over the next 1,000 years, but such results are strongly
dependent on model assumptions regarding climate change

differs from that in the Framework Convention on Climate Change, where climate change refers to a change of climate that is attributed directly or
indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and that is in addition to natural climate variability observed over
comparable time periods. For a definition of scientific and technical terms: see the Glossary in Appendix |.

the understanding of all aspects of climate change!, including
how human activities can cause such changes and can be
impacted by them. It had become widely recognised that
human-influenced emissions of greenhouse gases have the
potential to alter the climate system (see Box 1), with possible
deleterious or beneficial effects. It was also recognised that
addressing such global issues required organisation on a global

"In the First Assessment Report in 1990, Working Group I broadly
described the status of the understanding of the climate system
and climate change that had been gained over the preceding
decades of research. Several major points were emphasised. The
greenhouse effect is a natural feature of the planet, and its
fundamental physics is well understood. The atmospheric
abundances of greenhouse gases were increasing, due largely to
human activities. Continued future growth in greenhouse gas
emissions was predicted to lead to significant increases in the
average surface temperature of the planet, increases that would
exceed the natural variation of the past several millennia and that
could be reversed only slowly. The past century had, at that time,
seen a surface warming of nearly 0.5°C, which was broadly
consistent with that predicted by climate models for the
greenhouse gas increases, but was also comparable to what was
then known about natural variation. Lastly, it was pointed out that
the current level of understanding at that time and the existing
capabilities of climate models limited the prediction of changes
in the climate of specific regions.

with the inclusion of sulphate aerosols and stratospheric ozone as

simulative capability to compare to the observed patterns of
regional temperature changes, the report concluded that the
ability to quantify the human influence on global climate was
limited. The limitations arose because the expected signal was
still emerging from the noise of natural variability and because of
uncertainties in other key factors. Nevertheless, the report also
concluded that “the balance of evidence suggests a discernible
human influence on global climate”. Lastly, based on a range of

"Anthropogenic aerosols (microscopic airborne particles or droplets)
in the troposphere, such as those derived from fossil fuel and
biomass burning, can reflect solar radiation, which leads to a
cooling tendency in the climate system. Because it can absorb solar
radiation, black carbon (soot) aerosol tends to warm the climate
system. In addition, changes in aerosol concentrations can alter
cloud amount and cloud reflectivity through their effect on cloud
properties and lifetimes. In most cases, tropospheric aerosols tend
to produce a negative radiative forcing and a cooler climate. They
have a much shorter lifetime (days to weeks) than most greenhouse

"The Earth absorbs radiation from the Sun, mainly at the surface.
This energy is then redistributed by the atmospheric and oceanic
circulations and radiated back to space at longer (infrared)
wavelengths. For the annual mean and for the Earth as a whole, the
incoming solar radiation energy is balanced approximately by the
outgoing terrestrial radiation. Any factor that alters the radiation
received from the Sun or lost to space, or that alters the redistri-
bution of energy within the atmosphere and between the atmosphere,
land, and ocean, can affect climate. A change in the net radiative
energy available to the global Earth-atmosphere system is termed
here, and in previous IPCC reports, a radiative forcing. Positive
radiative forcings tend to warm the Earth’s surface and lower
atmosphere. Negative radiative forcings tend to cool them.

"Increases in the concentrations of greenhouse gases will reduce the
efficiency with which the Earth’s surface radiates to space. More of
the outgoing terrestrial radiation from the surface is absorbed by
the atmosphere and re-emitted at higher altitudes and lower temper-
atures. This results in a positive radiative forcing that tends to
warm the lower atmosphere and surface. Because less heat escapes
to space, this is the enhanced greenhouse effect — an enhancement
of an effect that has operated in the Earth’s atmosphere for billions
of years due to the presence of naturally occurring greenhouse
gases: water vapour, carbon dioxide, ozone, methane and nitrous

increase in concentration of each greenhouse gas, the radiative
properties of the gases involved, and the concentrations of other
greenhouse gases already present in the atmosphere. Further, many
greenhouse gases reside in the atmosphere for centuries after being

"Volcanic activity can inject large amounts of sulphur-containing

a large, but transitory, negative radiative forcing, tending to cool the

"Is the Earth’s climate changing? The answer is unequivocally
“Yes”. A suite of observations supports this conclusion and
provides insight about the rapidity of those changes. These
data are also the bedrock upon which to construct the answer

addressed in later Sections.

"The Sun’s output of energy varies by small amounts (0.1%) over
an 11-year cycle and, in addition, variations over longer periods
may occur. On time-scales of tens to thousands of years, slow
variations in the Earth’s orbit, which are well understood, have led
to changes in the seasonal and latitudinal distribution of solar
radiation. These changes have played an important part in
controlling the variations of climate in the distant past, such as the
glacial and inter-glacial cycles.
"	Text
"This Section places particular emphasis on current knowledge of
past changes in key climate variables: temperature, precipitation
and atmospheric moisture, snow cover, extent of land and sea
ice, sea level, patterns in atmospheric and oceanic circulation,
extreme weather and climate events, and overall features of the
climate variability. The concluding part of this Section compares
the observed trends in these various climate indicators to see if a
collective picture emerges. The degree of this internal
consistency is a critical factor in assessing the level of confidence
in the current understanding of the climate system.

"When radiative forcing changes, the climate system responds on
various time-scales. The longest of these are due to the large heat
capacity of the deep ocean and dynamic adjustment of the ice
sheets. This means that the transient response to a change (either
positive or negative) may last for thousands of years. Any changes
in the radiative balance of the Earth, including those due to an
increase in greenhouse gases or in aerosols, will alter the global
hydrological cycle and atmospheric and oceanic circulation,
thereby affecting weather patterns and regional temperatures and
precipitation.

Any human-induced changes in climate will be embedded in a
background of natural climatic variations that occur on a whole
range of time- and space-scales. Climate variability can occur as a
result of natural changes in the forcing of the climate system, for
example variations in the strength of the incoming solar radiation
and changes in the concentrations of aerosols arising from volcanic
eruptions. Natural climate variations can also occur in the absence
of a change in external forcing, as a result of complex interactions
between components of the climate system, such as the coupling
between the atmosphere and ocean. The El Nifio-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon is an example of such natural
“internal” variability on interannual time-scales. To distinguish
anthropogenic climate changes from natural variations, it is
necessary to identify the anthropogenic “signal” against the
background “noise” of natural climate variability.
"	Text
"This Section provides an updated summary of the observations
that delineate how the climate system has changed in the past.
Many of the variables of the climate system have been
measured directly, i.e., the “instrumental record”. For example,
widespread direct measurements of surface temperature began
around the middle of the 19th century. Near global
observations of other surface “weather” variables, such as
precipitation and winds, have been made for about a hundred
years. Sea level measurements have been made for over 100
years in some places, but the network of tide gauges with long
records provides only limited global coverage. Upper air
observations have been made systematically only since the late
1940s. There are also long records of surface oceanic
observations made from ships since the mid-19th century and
by dedicated buoys since about the late 1970s. Sub-surface
oceanic temperature measurements with near global coverage
are now available from the late 1940s. Since the late 1970s,
other data from Earth-observation satellites have been used to
provide a wide range of global observations of various
components of the climate system. In addition, a growing set
of palaeoclimatic data, e.g., from trees, corals, sediments, and
ice, are giving information about the Earth’s climate of
centuries and millennia before the present.

satellite record in 1979, the temperature data from both
satellites and weather balloons show a warming in the global
middle-to-lower troposphere at a rate of approximately 0.05 +
0.10°C per decade. The global average surface temperature has
increased significantly by 0.15 + 0.05°C/decade. The
difference in the warming rates is statistically significant. By
contrast, during the period 1958 to 1978, surface temperature
trends were near zero, while trends for the lowest 8 km of the
atmosphere were near 0.2°C/decade. About half of the
observed difference in warming since 1979 is likely* to be due
to the combination of the differences in spatial coverage of the
surface and tropospheric observations and the physical effects
of the sequence of volcanic eruptions and a substantial El
Nifio (see Box 4 for a general description of ENSO) that
occurred within this period. The remaining difference is very
likely real and not an observing bias. It arises primarily due to
differences in the rate of temperature change over the tropical
and sub-tropical regions, which were faster in the lowest 8 km
of the atmosphere before about 1979, but which have been
slower since then. There are no significant differences in
warming rates over mid-latitude continental regions in the
Northern Hemisphere. In the upper troposphere, no significant
global temperature trends have been detected since the early
1960s. In the stratosphere, as shown in Figure 4b, both
satellites and balloons show substantial cooling, punctuated by
sharp warming episodes of one to two years long that are due
to volcanic eruptions.

By contrast, there is no readily apparent relationship

support a major retreat of alpine and continental glaciers in
response to 20th century warming. In a few maritime
regions, increases in precipitation due to regional
atmospheric circulation changes have overshadowed

over Eastern Asia. Over the sub-tropics (10°N to 30°N), land-
surface rainfall has decreased on average (likely to be about
0.3%/decade), although this has shown signs of recovery in recent
years. Tropical land-surface precipitation measurements indicate
that precipitation likely has increased by about 0.2 to 0.3%/
decade over the 20th century, but increases are not evident over
the past few decades and the amount of tropical land (versus
ocean) area for the latitudes 10°N to 10°S is relatively small.
Nonetheless, direct measurements of precipitation and model
reanalyses of inferred precipitation indicate that rainfall has also
increased over large parts of the tropical oceans. Where and when
available, changes in annual streamflow often relate well to
changes in total precipitation. The increases in precipitation over
Northern Hemisphere mid- and high latitude land areas have a
strong correlation to long-term increases in total cloud amount. In

changes in precipitation have been detected in broad latitudinal

stronger westerlies, which correlate with cold season

fact that total precipitation has decreased or remained

analyses have been completed, but they suggest a decrease in
extra-tropical cyclone activity since the 1970s. Recent
analyses of changes in severe local weather (e.g., tornadoes,
thunderstorm days, and hail) in a few selected regions do not
provide compelling evidence to suggest long-term changes.
In general, trends in severe weather events are notoriously
difficult to detect because of their relatively rare occurrence

"C. The Forcing Agents That Cause
Climate Change
"	Title
"In addition to the past variations and changes in the Earth’s
climate, observations have also documented the changes that
have occurred in agents that can cause climate change. Most
notable among these are increases in the atmospheric
concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols (microscopic
airborne particles or droplets) and variations in solar activity,
both of which can alter the Earth’s radiation budget and hence
climate. These observational records of climate-forcing agents
are part of the input needed to understand the past climate
changes noted in the preceding Section and, very importantly,
to predict what climate changes could lie ahead (see Section F).
"	Text
"A change in the energy available to the global Earth-atmosphere
system due to changes in these forcing agents is termed
radiative forcing (Wm) of the climate system (see Box 1).
Defined in this manner, radiative forcing of climate change
constitutes an index of the relative global mean impacts on the
surface-troposphere system due to different natural and
anthropogenic causes. This Section updates the knowledge of
the radiative forcing of climate change that has occurred from
pre-industrial times to the present. Figure 9 shows the estimated

"Like the record of past climate changes, the data sets for forcing
agents are of varying length and quality. Direct measurements of
solar irradiance exist for only about two decades. The sustained
direct monitoring of the atmospheric concentrations of carbon
dioxide (CO,) began about the middle of the 20th century and,
in later years, for other long-lived, well-mixed gases such as
methane. Palaeo-atmospheric data from ice cores reveal the
concentration changes occurring in earlier millennia for some
greenhouse gases. In contrast, the time-series measurements for
the forcing agents that have relatively short residence times in
the atmosphere (e.g., aerosols) are more recent and are far less
complete, because they are harder to measure and are spatially
heterogeneous. Current data sets show the human influence on
atmospheric concentrations of both the long-lived greenhouse
gases and short-lived forcing agents during the last part of the
past millennium. Figure 8 illustrates the effects of the large
growth over the Industrial Era in the anthropogenic emissions of
greenhouse gases and sulphur dioxide, the latter being a
precursor of aerosols.

"Figure 9: Global, annual-mean radiative forcings (Wm?) due to a number of agents for the period from pre-industrial (1750) to present (late 1990s;
about 2000) (numerical values are also listed in Table 6.11 of Chapter 6). For detailed explanations, see Chapter 6.13. The height of the rectangular
bar denotes a central or best estimate value, while its absence denotes no best estimate is possible. The vertical line about the rectangular bar with “x”
delimiters indicates an estimate of the uncertainty range, for the most part guided by the spread in the published values of the forcing. A vertical line
without a rectangular bar and with “o” delimiters denotes a forcing for which no central estimate can be given owing to large uncertainties. The
uncertainty range specified here has no statistical basis and therefore differs from the use of the term elsewhere in this document. A “level of scientific
understanding” index is accorded to each forcing, with high, medium, low and very low levels, respectively. This represents the subjective judgement
about the reliability of the forcing estimate, involving factors such as the assumptions necessary to evaluate the forcing, the degree of knowledge of
the physical/chemical mechanisms determining the forcing, and the uncertainties surrounding the quantitative estimate of the forcing (see Table 6.12).
The well-mixed greenhouse gases are grouped together into a single rectangular bar with the individual mean contributions due to CO,, CH,, N,O and
halocarbons shown (see Tables 6.1 and 6.11). Fossil fuel burning is separated into the “black carbon” and “organic carbon” components with its
separate best estimate and range. The sign of the effects due to mineral dust is itself an uncertainty. The indirect forcing due to tropospheric aerosols
is poorly understood. The same is true for the forcing due to aviation via its effects on contrails and cirrus clouds. Only the “first” type of indirect effect
due to aerosols as applicable in the context of liquid clouds is considered here. The “second” type of effect is conceptually important, but there exists
very little confidence in the simulated quantitative estimates. The forcing associated with stratospheric aerosols from volcanic eruptions is highly
variable over the period and is not considered for this plot (however, see Figure 6.8). All the forcings shown have distinct spatial and seasonal features
(Figure 6.7) such that the global, annual means appearing on this plot do not yield a complete picture of the radiative perturbation. They are only
intended to give, in a relative sense, a first-order perspective on a global, annual mean scale and cannot be readily employed to obtain the climate
response to the total natural and/or anthropogenic forcings. As in the SAR, it is emphasised that the positive and negative global mean forcings cannot
be added up and viewed a priori as providing offsets in terms of the complete global climate impact. [Based on Figure 6.6]

some are chemical products from other emissions. Some

as a result, are well-mixed throughout the atmosphere.
Others are short-lived and have heterogeneous regional

and anthropogenic sources. Lastly, as shown in Figure 9, the
radiative forcings of individual agents can be positive (i.e., a
tendency to warm the Earth’s surface) or negative (i.e., a

"Table 1 provides examples of several greenhouse gases and
summarises their 1750 and 1998 concentrations, their

The contribution of a species to radiative forcing of climate
change depends on the molecular radiative properties of the
gas, the size of the increase in atmospheric concentration,
and the residence time of the species in the atmosphere,
once emitted. The latter — the atmospheric residence time of
the greenhouse gas — is a highly policy relevant characteristic.
Namely, emissions of a greenhouse gas that has a long
atmospheric residence time is a quasi-irreversible
commitment to sustained radiative forcing over decades,
centuries, or millennia, before natural processes can remove
the quantities emitted.

"Direct atmospheric measurements of CO, concentrations made

annual rates of CO, increase in the atmosphere varied from 0.9

changes can be related statistically to short-term climate
variability, which alters the rate at which atmospheric CO, is
taken up and released by the oceans and land. The highest rates
of increase in atmospheric CO, have typically been in strong El
Nifio years (Box 4). These higher rates of increase can be
plausibly explained by reduced terrestrial uptake (or terrestrial
outgassing) of CO, during El Nifio years, overwhelming the

The atmospheric concentration of CO, has increased from
280 ppm? in 1750 to 367 ppm in 1999 (31%, Table 1).
Today’s CO, concentration has not been exceeded during the
past 420,000 years and likely not during the past 20 million
years. The rate of increase over the past century is unprece-
dented, at least during the past 20,000 years (Figure 10).
The CO, isotopic composition and the observed decrease in
Oxygen (O,) demonstrates that the observed increase in CO,
is predominately due to the oxidation of organic carbon by
fossil-fuel combustion and deforestation. An expanding set
of palaeo-atmospheric data from air trapped in ice over
hundreds of millennia provide a context for the increase in
CO, concentrations during the Industrial Era (Figure 10).
Compared to the relatively stable CO, concentrations (280 +
10 ppm) of the preceding several thousand years, the
increase during the Industrial Era is dramatic. The average
rate of increase since 1980 is 0.4%/yr. The increase is a
consequence of CO, emissions. Most of the emissions
during the past 20 years are due to fossil fuel burning, the
rest (10 to 30%) is predominantly due to land-use change,
especially deforestation. As shown in Figure 9, CO, is the
dominant human-influenced greenhouse gas, with a current
radiative forcing of 1.46 Wm~’, being 60% of the total from
the changes in concentrations of all of the long-lived and
globally mixed greenhouse gases.

Atmospheric methane (CH,) concentrations have increased by
about 150% (1,060 ppb) since 1750. The present CH,
concentration has not been exceeded during the past 420,000
years. Methane (CH,) is a greenhouse gas with both natural
(e.g., wetlands) and human-influenced sources (e.g.,
agriculture, natural gas activities, and landfills). Slightly more
than half of current CH, emissions are anthropogenic. It is
removed from the atmosphere by chemical reactions. As
Figure 11 shows, systematic, globally representative
measurements of the concentration of CH, in the atmosphere
have been made since 1983, and the record of atmospheric
concentrations has been extended to earlier times from air
extracted from ice cores and firn layers. The current direct
radiative forcing of 0.48 Wm from CH, is 20% of the total
from all of the long-lived and globally mixed greenhouse
gases (see Figure 9).

"Nitrous oxide (N,V)

The atmospheric concentration of nitrous oxide (N,O) has
steadily increased during the Industrial Era and is now 16%
(46 ppb) larger than in 1750. The present N,O concentration
has not been exceeded during at least the past thousand years.
Nitrous oxide is another greenhouse gas with both natural and
anthropogenic sources, and it is removed from the atmosphere
by chemical reactions. Atmospheric concentrations of N,O
continue to increase at a rate of 0.25%/yr (1980 to 1998).
Significant interannual variations in the upward trend of N,O
concentrations are observed, e.g., a 50% reduction in annual
growth rate from 1991 to 1993. Suggested causes are several-
fold: a decrease in use of nitrogen-based fertiliser, lower
biogenic emissions, and larger stratospheric losses due to
volcanic-induced circulation changes. Since 1993, the growth
of N,O concentrations has returned to rates closer to those
observed during the 1980s. While this observed multi-year
variance has provided some potential insight into what
processes control the behaviour of atmospheric N,O, the
multi-year trends of this greenhouse gas remain largely
unexplained.

"The observed losses of stratospheric ozone layer over the past
two decades have caused a negative forcing of

0.15 +0.1 Wm* (i.e., a tendency toward cooling) of the
surface troposphere system. It was reported in Climate Change
1992: The Supplementary Report to the IPCC Scientific
Assessment, that depletion of the ozone layer by anthro-
pogenic halocarbons introduces a negative radiative forcing.
The estimate shown in Figure 9 is slightly larger in magnitude
than that given in the SAR, owing to the ozone depletion that
has continued over the past five years, and it is more certain as
a result of an increased number of modelling studies. Studies
with General Circulation Models indicate that, despite the
inhomogeneity in ozone loss (i.e., lower stratosphere at high
latitudes), such a negative forcing does relate to a surface
temperature decrease in proportion to the magnitude of the
negative forcing. Therefore, this negative forcing over the past
two decades has offset some of the positive forcing that is
occurring from the long-lived and globally well-mixed
greenhouse gases (Figure 9). A major source of uncertainty in
the estimation of the negative forcing is due to incomplete
knowledge of ozone depletion near the tropopause. Model
calculations indicate that increased penetration of ultraviolet
radiation to the troposphere, as a result of stratospheric ozone
depletion, leads to enhanced removal rates of gases like CH,,
thus amplifying the negative forcing due to ozone depletion.
As the ozone layer recovers in future decades because of the
effects of the Montreal Protocol, relative to the present, future
radiative forcing associated with stratospheric ozone is
projected to become positive.

relatively quickly to changes in the emissions of pollutants. On
the basis of limited observations and several modelling studies,
tropospheric ozone is estimated to have increased by about
35% since the Pre-industrial Era, with some regions experi-
encing larger and some with smaller increases. There have
been few observed increases in ozone concentrations in the
global troposphere since the mid-1980s at most of the few
remote locations where it is regularly measured. The lack of
observed increase over North America and Europe is related to
the lack of a sustained increase in ozone-precursor emissions
from those continents. However, some Asian stations indicate
a possible rise in tropospheric ozone, which could be related to
the increase in East Asian emissions. As a result of more
modelling studies than before, there is now an increased
confidence in the estimates of tropospheric ozone forcing. The
confidence, however, is still much less than that for the well-mixed
greenhouse gases, but more so than that for aerosol forcing.
Uncertainties arise because of limited information on pre-industrial
ozone distributions and limited information to evaluate
modelled global trends in the modern era (i.e., post-1960).

"Aerosols (very small airborne particles and droplets) are
known to influence significantly the radiative budget of the
Earth/atmosphere. Aerosol radiative effects occur in two
distinct ways: (i) the direct effect, whereby aerosols
themselves scatter and absorb solar and thermal infrared
radiation, and (ii) the indirect effect, whereby aerosols
modify the microphysical and hence the radiative properties
and amount of clouds. Aerosols are produced by a variety of
processes, both natural (including dust storms and volcanic
activity) and anthropogenic (including fossil fuel and
biomass burning). The atmospheric concentrations of
tropospheric aerosols are thought to have increased over
recent years due to increased anthropogenic emissions of
particles and their precursor gases, hence giving rise to
radiative forcing. Most aerosols are found in the lower
troposphere (below a few kilometres), but the radiative effect
of many aerosols is sensitive to the vertical distribution.
Aerosols undergo chemical and physical changes while in the
atmosphere, notably within clouds, and are removed largely
and relatively rapidly by precipitation (typically within a
week). Because of this short residence time and the
inhomogeneity of sources, aerosols are distributed
inhomogeneously in the troposphere, with maxima near the
sources. The radiative forcing due to aerosols depends not
only on these spatial distributions, but also on the size,
shape, and chemical composition of the particles and various
aspects (e.g., cloud formation) of the hydrological cycle as
well. As a result of all of these factors, obtaining accurate
estimates of this forcing has been very challenging, from
both the observational and theoretical standpoints.

points to a negative aerosol-induced indirect forcing in warm

indirect effect of aerosols: empirical methods and mechanistic
methods. The former have been applied to estimate the effects
of industrial aerosols, while the latter have been applied to
estimate the effects of sulphate, fossil fuel carbonaceous
aerosols, and biomass aerosols. In addition, models for the
indirect effect have been used to estimate the effects of the
initial change in droplet size and concentrations (a first
indirect effect), as well as the effects of the subsequent change
in precipitation efficiency (a second indirect effect). The
studies represented in Figure 9 provide an expert judgement
for the range of the first of these; the range is now slightly
wider than in the SAR; the radiative perturbation associated
with the second indirect effect is of the same sign and could be
of similar magnitude compared to the first effect.

"Radiative forcing of the climate system due to solar irradiance
change is estimated to be 0.3 + 0.2 Wm for the period 1750

fundamental source of all energy in the Earth’s climate system
is radiation from the Sun. Therefore, variation in solar output
is a radiative forcing agent. The absolute value of the
spectrally integrated total solar irradiance (TSI) incident on the
Earth is not known to better than about 4 Wm~, but satellite
observations since the late 1970s show relative variations over
the past two solar 11-year activity cycles of about 0.1%, which
is equivalent to a variation in radiative forcing of about 0.2

measurements of solar irradiance are not available. Variations
over longer periods may have been larger, but the techniques

however. These arise from difficulties in determining the
concentration and radiative characteristics of atmospheric
aerosols and the fraction of the aerosols that are of anthropogenic
origin, particularly the knowledge of the sources of
carbonaceous aerosols. This leads to considerable differences
(i.e., factor of two to three range) in the burden and
substantial differences in the vertical distribution (factor of
ten). Anthropogenic dust aerosol is also poorly quantified.
Satellite observations, combined with model calculations, are
enabling the identification of the spatial signature of the total
aerosol radiative effect in clear skies; however, the quanti-
tative amount is still uncertain.

(thereby warming the surface). The competition between these
effects depends on cloud height, thickness and radiative
properties. The radiative properties and evolution of clouds
depend on the distribution of atmospheric water vapour, water
drops, ice particles, atmospheric aerosols and cloud thickness.
The physical basis of cloud parametrizations is greatly improved

that removes much of the effects of some model errors on
results. What is often done is that first a “control” climate
simulation is run with the model. Then, the climate
change experiment simulation is run, for example, with
increased CO, in the model atmosphere. Finally, the

"A major feedback accounting for the large warming predicted by
climate models in response to an increase in CO, is the increase
in atmospheric water vapour. An increase in the temperature of
the atmosphere increases its water-holding capacity; however,
since most of the atmosphere is undersaturated, this does not
automatically mean that water vapour, itself, must increase.
Within the boundary layer (roughly the lowest 1 to 2 km of the
atmosphere), water vapour increases with increasing temperature.
In the free troposphere above the boundary layer, where the
water vapour greenhouse effect is most important, the situation is
harder to quantify. Water vapour feedback, as derived from
current models, approximately doubles the warming from what it
would be for fixed water vapour. Since the SAR, major
improvements have occurred in the treatment of water vapour in
models, although detrainment of moisture from clouds remains
quite uncertain and discrepancies exist between model water
vapour distributions and those observed. Models are capable of
simulating the moist and very dry regions observed in the tropics
and sub-tropics and how they evolve with the seasons and from
year to year. While reassuring, this does not provide a check of
the feedbacks, although the balance of evidence favours a
positive clear-sky water vapour feedback of the magnitude
comparable to that found in simulations.

There has been a growing appreciation of the importance of
the stratosphere in the climate system because of changes in
its structure and recognition of the vital role of both radiative
and dynamical processes. The vertical profile of temperature
change in the atmosphere, including the stratosphere, is an
important indicator in detection and attribution studies. Most
of the observed decreases in lower-stratospheric temperatures
have been due to ozone decreases, of which the Antarctic
“ozone hole” is a part, rather than increased CO, concen-
trations. Waves generated in the troposphere can propagate
into the stratosphere where they are absorbed. As a result,
stratospheric changes alter where and how these waves are
absorbed, and the effects can extend downward into the
troposphere. Changes in solar irradiance, mainly in the
ultraviolet (UV), lead to photochemically-induced ozone
changes and, hence, alter the stratospheric heating rates, which
can alter the tropospheric circulation. Limitations in resolution
and relatively poor representation of some stratospheric
processes adds uncertainty to model results.

"The representation of sea-ice processes continues to improve,
with several climate models now incorporating physically based
treatments of ice dynamics. The representation of land-ice
processes in global climate models remains rudimentary. The
cryosphere consists of those regions of Earth that are seasonally
or perennially covered by snow and ice. Sea ice is important
because it reflects more incoming solar radiation than the sea
surface (i.e., it has a higher albedo), and it insulates the sea from
heat loss during the winter. Therefore, reduction of sea ice gives
a positive feedback on climate warming at high latitudes.
Furthermore, because sea ice contains less salt than sea water,
when sea ice is formed the salt content (salinity) and density of
the surface layer of the ocean is increased. This promotes an
exchange of water with deeper layers of the ocean, affecting
ocean circulation. The formation of icebergs and the melting of
ice shelves returns fresh water from the land to the ocean, so that
changes in the rates of these processes could affect ocean
circulation by changing the surface salinity. Snow has a higher
albedo than the land surface; hence, reductions in snow cover
lead to a similar positive albedo feedback, although weaker than
for sea ice. Increasingly complex snow schemes and sub-grid
scale variability in ice cover and thickness, which can signifi-
cantly influence albedo and atmosphere-ocean exchanges, are
being introduced in some climate models.

There is an increasing realisation that natural circulation
patterns, such as ENSO and NAO, play a fundamental role in
global climate and its interannual and longer-term variability.
The strongest natural fluctuation of climate on interannual time-
scales is the ENSO phenomenon (see Box 4). It is an inherently
coupled atmosphere-ocean mode with its core activity in the
tropical Pacific, but with important regional climate impacts
throughout the world. Global climate models are only now
beginning to exhibit variability in the tropical Pacific that
resembles ENSO, mainly through increased meridional
resolution at the equator. Patterns of sea surface temperature and
atmospheric circulation similar to those occurring during ENSO
on interannual time-scales also occur on decadal and longer
time-scales.

the nature of carbonate chemistry), but the rate of uptake is

the mechanisms involved and hence also about the likelihood
or time-scales of such transitions. The climate system involves
many processes and feedbacks that interact in complex non-
linear ways. This interaction can give rise to thresholds in the
climate system that can be crossed if the system is perturbed
sufficiently. There is evidence from polar ice cores suggesting
that atmospheric regimes can change within a few years and
that large-scale hemispheric changes can evolve as fast as a few
decades. For example, the possibility of a threshold for a rapid

circulation can be characterised by different preferred patterns;
e.g., arising from ENSO and the NAO/AO, and changes in their
phase can occur rapidly. Basic theory and models suggest that
climate change may be first expressed in changes in the
frequency of occurrence of these patterns. Changes in
vegetation, through either direct anthropogenic deforestation or
those caused by global warming, could occur rapidly and could
induce further climate change. It is supposed that the rapid

"The thermohaline circulation (THC) is responsible for the major
part of the meridional heat transport in the Atlantic Ocean. The
THC is a global-scale overturning in the ocean driven by density
differences arising from temperature and salinity effects. In the
Atlantic, heat is transported by warm surface waters flowing
northward and cold saline waters from the North Atlantic
returning at depth. Reorganisations in the Atlantic THC can be
triggered by perturbations in the surface buoyancy, which is
influenced by precipitation, evaporation, continental runoff, sea-
ice formation, and the exchange of heat, processes that could all
change with consequences for regional and global climate.
Interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean are also
likely to be of considerable importance on decadal and longer
time-scales, where the THC is involved. The interplay between
the large-scale atmospheric forcing, with warming and
evaporation in low latitudes and cooling and increased precipi-
tation at high latitudes, forms the basis of a potential instability
of the present Atlantic THC. ENSO may also influence the
Atlantic THC by altering the fresh water balance of the tropical
Atlantic, therefore providing a coupling between low and high
latitudes. Uncertainties in the representation of small-scale flows
over sills and through narrow straits and of ocean convection
limit the ability of models to simulate situations involving
substantial changes in the THC. The less saline North Pacific
means that a deep THC does not occur in the Pacific.

Uncertainties in other forcings that have been included do not
prevent identification of the effect of anthropogenic
greenhouse gases over the last 50 years. The sulphate forcing,
while uncertain, is negative over this period. Changes in
natural forcing during most of this period are also estimated to
be negative. Detection of the influence of anthropogenic
greenhouse gases therefore cannot be eliminated either by the
uncertainty in sulphate aerosol forcing or because natural
forcing has not been included in all model simulations. Studies
that distinguish the separate responses to greenhouse gas,
sulphate aerosol and natural forcing produce uncertain
estimates of the amplitude of the sulphate aerosol and natural
signals, but almost all studies are nevertheless able to detect
the presence of the anthropogenic greenhouse gas signal in the

internal variability are an adequate representation (i.e., that natural forcing has had little net impact on this diagnostic). Observed residual
variability is consistent with this assumption in all but one case (ECHAMS, indicated by the asterisk). One is obliged to make this assumption
to include models for which only a simulation of the anthropogenic response is available, but uncertainty estimates in these single signal
cases are incomplete since they do not account for uncertainty in the naturally forced response. These ranges indicate, however, the high
level of confidence with which internal variability, as simulated by these various models, can be rejected as an explanation of recent near-

factors on individual greenhouse (G), sulphate (S), solar-plus-volcanic (N), solar-only (So) and volcanic-only (V) signals for those cases in
which the relevant simulations have been performed. In these cases, multiple factors are estimated simultaneously to account for uncertainty
in the amplitude of the naturally forced response. The uncertainties increase but the greenhouse signal remains consistently detectable. In
one case (ECHAMS3) the model appears to be overestimating the greenhouse response (scaling range in the G signal inconsistent with unity),
but this result is sensitive to which component of the control is used to define the detection space. It is also not known how it would respond
to the inclusion of a volcanic signal. In cases where both solar and volcanic forcing is included (HadCM2 and HadCM3), G and S signals

In 1996, the IPCC began the development of a new set of
emissions scenarios, effectively to update and replace the
well-known IS92 scenarios. The approved new set of
scenarios is described in the IPCC Special Report on
Emission Scenarios (SRES). Four different narrative
storylines were developed to describe consistently the
relationships between the forces driving emissions and their
evolution and to add context for the scenario quantification.
The resulting set of 40 scenarios (35 of which contain data
on the full range of gases required to force climate models)
cover a wide range of the main demographic, economic and
technological driving forces of future greenhouse gas and
sulphur emissions. Each scenario represents a specific
quantification of one of the four storylines. All the scenarios
based on the same storyline constitute a scenario “family”
(See Box 5, which briefly describes the main characteristics
of the four SRES storylines and scenario families). The
SRES scenarios do not include additional climate initiatives,
which means that no scenarios are included that explicitly
assume implementation of the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change or the emissions targets of
the Kyoto Protocol. However, greenhouse gas emissions are
directly affected by non-climate change policies designed for
a wide range of other purposes (e.g., air quality).
Furthermore, government policies can, to varying degrees,
influence the greenhouse gas emission drivers, such as

"since the SKES Was Not approved unthh 1S Waren 2UUYU, It
was too late for the modelling community to incorporate the
final approved scenarios in their models and have the results
available in time for this Third Assessment Report. However,
draft scenarios were released to climate modellers earlier to
facilitate their input to the Third Assessment Report, in
accordance with a decision of the IPCC Bureau in 1998. At
that time, one marker scenario was chosen from each of four
of the scenario groups based directly on the storylines (A1B,
A2, B1, and B2). The choice of the markers was based on
which of the initial quantifications best reflected the storyline
and features of specific models. Marker scenarios are no
more or less likely than any other scenarios, but are
considered illustrative of a particular storyline. Scenarios
were also selected later to illustrate the other two scenario
groups (A1FI and AIT) within the Al family, which specif-
ically explore alternative technology developments, holding
the other driving forces constant. Hence there is an
illustrative scenario for each of the six scenario groups, and
all are equally plausible. Since the latter two illustrative
scenarios were selected at a late stage in the process, the
AOGCM modelling results presented in this report only use
two of the four draft marker scenarios. At present, only
scenarios A2 and B2 have been integrated by more than one
AOGCM. The AOGCM results have been augmented by
results from simple climate models that cover all six
illustrative scenarios. The IS92a scenario is also presented in
a number of cases to provide direct comparison with the
results presented in the SAR.

sensitivity. Analysis of simple models and intercomparisons of

for most scenarios over the coming decades, errors in large-scale
temperature projections are likely to increase in proportion to the
magnitude of the overall response. The estimated size of and
uncertainty in current observed warming rates attributable to
human influence thus provides a relatively model-independent
estimate of uncertainty in multi-decade projections under most
scenarios. To be consistent with recent observations, anthro-
pogenic warming is likely to lie in the range 0.1 to 0.2°C/decade

classified as showing either agreement on warming in excess of 40% above the global average (‘Much greater than average warming’), agreement
on warming greater than the global average (‘Greater than average warming’), agreement on warming less than the global average (‘Less than

also a category for agreement on cooling (which never occurs). A consistent result from at least seven of the nine models is deemed necessary for

"Most models show weakening of the Northern Hemisphere
Thermohaline Circulation (THC), which contributes to a
reduction of the surface warming in the northern North
Atlantic. Even in models where the THC weakens, there is still
a warming over Europe due to increased greenhouse gases. In
experiments where the atmospheric greenhouse gas concen-
tration is stabilised at twice its present day value, the North
Atlantic THC is projected to recover from initial weakening
within one to several centuries. The THC could collapse
entirely in either hemisphere if the rate of change in radiative
forcing is large enough and applied long enough. Models
indicate that a decrease of the THC reduces its resilience to
perturbations, i.e., a once reduced THC appears to be less
stable and a shut-down can become more likely. However, it is
too early to say with confidence whether an irreversible
collapse in the THC is likely or not, or at what threshold it

El Nifio-like change of the mean state of tropical Pacific sea
surface temperatures, the cause is uncertain. It has been related
to changes in the cloud radiative forcing and/or evaporative
damping of the east-west sea surface temperature gradient in
some models. Confidence in projections of changes in future
frequency, amplitude, and spatial pattern of El Nifio events in
the tropical Pacific is tempered by some shortcomings in how
well El Nifio is simulated in complex models. Current
projections show little change or a small increase in amplitude
for El Nifio events over the next 100 years. However, even with
little or no change in El Nifio amplitude, global warming is
likely to lead to greater extremes of drying and heavy rainfall
and increase the risk of droughts and floods that occur with El
Nifio events in many regions. It also is likely that warming
associated with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations will
cause an increase of Asian summer monsoon precipitation
variability. Changes in monsoon mean duration and strength
depend on the details of the emission scenario. The confidence
in such projections is limited by how well the climate models
simulate the detailed seasonal evolution of the monsoons.
There is no clear agreement on changes in frequency or
structure of naturally occurring modes of variability, such as
the North Atlantic Oscillation, i.e., the magnitude and character
of the changes vary across the models.

isostatic and tectonic, will continue through the 21st century

"For the full set of SRES scenarios, a sea level rise of 0.09 to
0.88 m is projected for 1990 to 2100 (see Figure 24),
primarily from thermal expansion and loss of mass from
glaciers and ice caps. The central value is 0.48 m, which
corresponds to an average rate of about two to four times the
rate over the 20th century. The range of sea level rise
presented in the SAR was 0.13 to 0.94 m based on the IS92
scenarios. Despite higher temperature change projections in
this assessment, the sea level projections are slightly lower,
primarily due to the use of improved models which give a
smaller contribution from glaciers and ice sheets. If
terrestrial storage continues at its current rates, the
projections could be changed by —0.21 to 0.11 m. For an
average of the AOGCMs, the SRES scenarios give results
that differ by 0.02 m or less for the first half of the 21st

50% of the central value. Beyond the 21st century, sea level

All of the stabilisation profiles studied require CO,
emissions to eventually drop well below current levels.
Anthropogenic CO, emission rates that arrive at stable CO,
concentration levels from 450 to 1,000 ppm were deduced
from the prescribed CO, profiles (Figure 25a). The results
(Figure 25b) are not substantially different from those
presented in the SAR; however, the range is larger, mainly
due to the range of future terrestrial carbon uptake caused
by different assumptions in the models. Stabilisation at 450,
650 or 1,000 ppm would require global anthropogenic
emissions to drop below 1990 levels within a few decades,
about a century, or about two centuries, respectively, and
continue to steadily decrease thereafter. Although there is
sufficient uptake capacity in the ocean to incorporate 70 to
80% of foreseeable anthropogenic CO, emissions to the
atmosphere, this process takes centuries due to the rate of
ocean mixing. As a result, even several centuries after
emissions occurred, about a quarter of the increase in
concentration caused by these emissions is still present in
the atmosphere. To maintain constant CO, concentration
beyond 2300 requires emissions to drop to match the rate of
carbon sinks at that time. Natural land and ocean sinks with
the capacity to persist for hundreds or thousands of years are

"Current ice dynamic models project that the West Antarctic ice
sheet (WAIS) will contribute no more than 3 mm/yr to sea level
rise over the next thousand years, even if significant changes
were to occur in the ice shelves. Such results are strongly
dependent on model assumptions regarding climate change
scenarios, ice dynamics and other factors. Apart from the
possibility of an internal ice dynamic instability, surface
melting will affect the long-term viability of the Antarctic ice
sheet. For warmings of more than 10°C, simple runoff models
predict that a zone of net mass loss would develop on the ice
sheet surface. Irreversible disintegration of the WAIS would
result because the WAIS cannot retreat to higher ground once
its margins are subjected to surface melting and begin to
recede. Such a disintegration would take at least a few
millennia. Thresholds for total disintegration of the East
Antarctic ice sheet by surface melting involve warmings above

chaotic system, and therefore the long-term prediction of
future exact climate states is not possible. Rather the focus
must be upon the prediction of the probability distribution of
the system’s future possible states by the generation of
ensembles of model solutions.

improve prognostic capabilities generally. The interplay of

"Address more completely patterns of long-term climate
variability. This topic arises both in model calculations and in
the climate system. In simulations, the issue of climate drift
within model calculations needs to be clarified better in part
because it compounds the difficulty of distinguishing signal
and noise. With respect to the long-term natural variability in
the climate system per se, it is important to understand this
variability and to expand the emerging capability of
predicting patterns of organised variability such as ENSO.

"Improve the integrated hierarchy of global and regional
climate models with emphasis on improving the simulation of
regional impacts and extreme weather events. This will require
improvements in the understanding of the coupling between
the major atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial systems, and
extensive diagnostic modelling and observational studies that
evaluate and improve simulative performance. A particularly
important issue is the adequacy of data needed to attack the
question of changes in extreme events.

hydrosphere, the cryosphere, the land surface and the biosphere,

Weather and climate have a profound influence on life on Earth.
They are part of the daily experience of human beings and are
essential for health, food production and well-being. Many
consider the prospect of human-induced climate change as a
matter of concern. The IPCC Second Assessment Report
(IPCC, 1996) (hereafter SAR) presented scientific evidence that
human activities may already be influencing the climate. If one
wishes to understand, detect and eventually predict the human
influence on climate, one needs to understand the system that
determines the climate of the Earth and of the processes that
lead to climate change.

Climate variations and change, caused by external forcings,
may be partly predictable, particularly on the larger, continental
and global, spatial scales. Because human activities, such as the
emission of greenhouse gases or land-use change, do result in
external forcing, it is believed that the large-scale aspects of
human-induced climate change are also partly predictable.
However the ability to actually do so is limited because we
cannot accurately predict population change, economic change,
technological development, and other relevant characteristics of
future human activity. In practice, therefore, one has to rely on
carefully constructed scenarios of human behaviour and
determine climate projections on the basis of such scenarios.

The atmosphere is the most unstable and rapidly changing
part of the system. Its composition, which has changed with the
evolution of the Earth, is of central importance to the problem
assessed in this Report. The Earth’s dry atmosphere is composed
mainly of nitrogen (N>, 78.1% volume mixing ratio), oxygen (O3,
20.9% volume mixing ratio, and argon (Ar, 0.93% volume mixing
ratio). These gases have only limited interaction with the
incoming solar radiation and they do not interact with the infrared
radiation emitted by the Earth. However there are a number of
trace gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO), methane (CH,), nitrous
oxide (N,O) and ozone (O3), which do absorb and emit infrared
radiation. These so called greenhouse gases, with a total volume
mixing ratio in dry air of less than 0.1% by volume, play an

However this is only part of the reality that determines
weather and climate. The growth, movement and decay of weather
systems depend also on the vertical structure of the atmosphere, the
influence of the underlying land and sea and many other factors not
directly experienced by human beings. Climate is determined by
the atmospheric circulation and by its interactions with the large-
scale ocean currents and the land with its features such as albedo,
vegetation and soil moisture. The climate of the Earth as a whole
depends on factors that influence the radiative balance, such as for
example, the atmospheric composition, solar radiation or volcanic
eruptions. To understand the climate of our planet Earth and its
variations and to understand and possibly predict the changes of
the climate brought about by human activities, one cannot ignore
any of these many factors and components that determine the
climate. We must understand the climate system, the complicated
system consisting of various components, including the dynamics
and composition of the atmosphere, the ocean, the ice and snow
cover, the land surface and its features, the many mutual
interactions between them, and the large variety of physical,
chemical and biological processes taking place in and among
these components. “Climate” in a wider sense refers to the state of
the climate system as a whole, including a statistical description of
its variations. This chapter provides the reader with an overview of
the climate system and the climate in this wider sense, and acts as
an introduction to the Report.

 
"	Text
"In common parlance the notions “weather” and “climate”
are loosely defined!. The “weather”, as we experience it, is the
fluctuating state of the atmosphere around us, characterised by
the temperature, wind, precipitation, clouds and other weather
elements. This weather is the result of rapidly developing and
decaying weather systems such as mid-latitude low and high
pressure systems with their associated frontal zones, showers
and tropical cyclones. Weather has only limited predictability.
Mesoscale convective systems are predictable over a period of
hours only; synoptic scale cyclones may be predictable over a
period of several days to a week. Beyond a week or two
individual weather systems are unpredictable. “Climate” refers
to the average weather in terms of the mean and its variability
over a certain time-span and a certain area. Classical
climatology provides a classification and description of the
various climate regimes found on Earth. Climate varies from
place to place, depending on latitude, distance to the sea,
vegetation, presence or absence of mountains or other
geographical factors. Climate varies also in time; from season
to season, year to year, decade to decade or on much longer
time-scales, such as the Ice Ages. Statistically significant
variations of the mean state of the climate or of its variability,
typically persisting for decades or longer, are referred to as
“climate change”. The Glossary gives definitions of these
important and central notions of “climate variability” and
“climate change”.

"atmosphere contains water vapour (H,O), which is also a natural
greenhouse gas. Its volume mixing ratio is highly variable, but it
is typically in the order of 1%. Because these greenhouse gases
absorb the infrared radiation emitted by the Earth and emit
infrared radiation up- and downward, they tend to raise the
temperature near the Earth’s surface. Water vapour, CO, and O;

"The atmospheric distribution of ozone and its role in the
Earth’s energy budget is unique. Ozone in the lower part of the
atmosphere, the troposphere and lower stratosphere, acts as a
greenhouse gas. Higher up in the stratosphere there is a natural
layer of high ozone concentration, which absorbs solar ultra-violet
radiation. In this way this so-called ozone layer plays an essential
role in the stratosphere’s radiative balance, at the same time

filtering out this potentially damaging form of radiation.

"The cryosphere, including the ice sheets of Greenland and
Antarctica, continental glaciers and snow fields, sea ice and
permafrost, derives its importance to the climate system from
its high reflectivity (albedo) for solar radiation, its low
thermal conductivity, its large thermal inertia and, especially,
its critical role in driving deep ocean water circulation.
Because the ice sheets store a large amount of water,
variations in their volume are a potential source of sea level
variations (Chapter 11).

Beside these gases, the atmosphere also ¢ contains “solid and
liquid particles (aerosols) and clouds, which interact with the
incoming and outgoing radiation in a complex and spatially very
variable manner. The most variable component of the atmosphere
is water in its various phases such as vapour, cloud droplets, and
ice crystals. Water vapour is the strongest greenhouse gas. For
these reasons and because the transition between the various
phases absorb and release much energy, water vapour is central to
the climate and its variability and change.

 
"	Text
"The hydrosphere is the component comprising all liquid
surface and subterranean water, both fresh water, including
rivers, lakes and aquifers, and saline water of the oceans and
seas. Fresh water runoff from the land returning to the oceans
in rivers influences the ocean’s composition and circulation.
The oceans cover approximately 70% of the Earth’s surface.
They store and transport a large amount of energy and dissolve
and store great quantities of carbon dioxide. Their circulation,
driven by the wind and by density contrasts caused by salinity
and thermal gradients (the so-called thermohaline circulation),
is much slower than the atmospheric circulation. Mainly due to
the large thermal inertia of the oceans, they damp vast and
strong temperature changes and function as a regulator of the
Earth’s climate and as a source of natural climate variability, in
particular on the longer time-scales.

coupled and exchange, among others, water vapour and heat
through evaporation. This is part of the hydrological cycle and
leads to condensation, cloud formation, precipitation and runoff,
and supplies energy to weather systems. On the other hand,
precipitation has an influence on salinity, its distribution and the
thermohaline circulation. Atmosphere and oceans also
exchange, among other gases, carbon dioxide, maintaining a
balance by dissolving it in cold polar water which sinks into the
deep ocean and by outgassing in relatively warm upwelling
water near the equator.

"Vegetation and soils at the Jand surface control how energy
received from the Sun is returned to the atmosphere. Some is
returned as long-wave (infrared) radiation, heating the
atmosphere as the land surface warms. Some serves to evaporate
water, either in the soil or in the leaves of plants, bringing water
back into the atmosphere. Because the evaporation of soil
moisture requires energy, soil moisture has a strong influence on
the surface temperature. The texture of the land surface (its
roughness) influences the atmosphere dynamically as winds blow
over the land’s surface. Roughness is determined by both
topography and vegetation. Wind also blows dust from the

The marine and terrestrial biospheres have a major impact
on the atmosphere’s composition. The biota influence the uptake
and release of greenhouse gases. Through the photosynthetic
process, both marine and terrestrial plants (especially forests)
store significant amounts of carbon from carbon dioxide. Thus,
the biosphere plays a central role in the carbon cycle, as well as
in the budgets of many other gases, such as methane and nitrous
oxide. Other biospheric emissions are the so-called volatile
organic compounds (VOC) which may have important effects on
atmospheric chemistry, on aerosol formation and therefore on
climate. Because the storage of carbon and the exchange of trace
gases are influenced by climate, feedbacks between climate
change and atmospheric concentrations of trace gases can occur.
The influence of climate on the biosphere is preserved as fossils,
tree rings, pollen and other records, so that much of what is
known of past climates comes from such biotic indicators.

For a stable climate, a balance is required between
incoming solar radiation and the outgoing radiation emitted by
the climate system. Therefore the climate system itself must
radiate on average 235 Wm back into space. Details of this
energy balance can be seen in Figure 1.2, which shows on the
left hand side what happens with the incoming solar radiation,
and on the right hand side how the atmosphere emits the
outgoing infrared radiation. Any physical object radiates energy
of an amount and at wavelengths typical for the temperature of
the object: at higher temperatures more energy is radiated at
shorter wavelengths. For the Earth to radiate 235 Wm, it
should radiate at an effective emission temperature of —19°C
with typical wavelengths in the infrared part of the spectrum.
This is 33°C lower than the average temperature of 14°C at the
Earth’s surface. To understand why this is so, one must take into
account the radiative properties of the atmosphere in the infrared
part of the spectrum.

The ultimate s source of energy that drives the climate system is
radiation from the Sun. About half of the radiation is in the visible
short-wave part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The other half
is mostly in the near-infrared part, with some in the ultraviolet
part of the spectrum. Each square metre of the Earth’s spherical
surface outside the atmosphere receives an average throughout
the year of 342 Watts of solar radiation, 31% of which is
immediately reflected back into space by clouds, by the
atmosphere, and by the Earth’s surface. The remaining 235 Wm
is partly absorbed by the atmosphere but most (168 Wm"") warms
the Earth’s surface: the land and the ocean. The Earth’s surface
returns that heat to the atmosphere, partly as infrared radiation,
partly as sensible heat and as water vapour which releases its heat
when it condenses higher up in the atmosphere. This exchange of
energy between surface and atmosphere maintains under present
conditions a global mean temperature near the surface of 14°C,
decreasing rapidly with height and reaching a mean temperature
of —58°C at the top of the troposphere.

In an equilibrium climate state the average net radiation at the top
of the atmosphere is zero. A change in either the solar radiation
or the infrared radiation changes the net radiation. The correspon-
ding imbalance is called “radiative forcing”. In practice, for this
purpose, the top of the troposphere (the tropopause) is taken as
the top of the atmosphere, because the stratosphere adjusts in a
matter of months to changes in the radiative balance, whereas the
surface-troposphere system adjusts much more slowly, owing
principally to the large thermal inertia of the oceans. The
radiative forcing of the surface troposphere system is then the
change in net irradiance at the tropopause after allowing for
stratospheric temperatures to re-adjust to radiative equilibrium,

“atmospheric window”, as shown in Figure 1.2. They emit in turn
infrared radiation in all directions including downward to the
Earth’s surface. Thus greenhouse gases trap heat within the
atmosphere. This mechanism is called the natural greenhouse
effect. The net result is an upward transfer of infrared radiation
from warmer levels near the Earth’s surface to colder levels at
higher altitudes. The infrared radiation is effectively radiated
back into space from an altitude with a temperature of, on
average, —19°C, in balance with the incoming radiation, whereas
the Earth’s surface is kept at a much higher temperature of on
average 14°C. This effective emission temperature of —19°C
corresponds in mid-latitudes with a height of approximately 5
km. Note that it is essential for the greenhouse effect that the
temperature of the lower atmosphere is not constant (isothermal)
but decreases with height. The natural greenhouse effect is part
of the energy balance of the Earth, as can be seen schematically
in Figure 1.2.

Climate varies naturally on all time-scales. During the last million
years or so, glacial periods and interglacials have alternated as a
result of variations in the Earth’s orbital parameters. Based on
Antarctic ice cores, more detailed information is available now
about the four full glacial cycles during the last 500,000 years. In
recent years it was discovered that during the last glacial period
large and very rapid temperature variations took place over large
parts of the globe, in particular in the higher latitudes of the
Northern Hemisphere. These abrupt events saw temperature
changes of many degrees within a human lifetime. In contrast, the
last 10,000 years appear to have been relatively more stable,
though locally quite large changes have occurred.

External forcings, such as the solar radiation or the large
amounts of aerosols ejected by volcanic eruption into the
atmosphere, may vary on widely different time-scales, causing
natural variations in the radiative forcing. These variations may
be negative or positive. In either case the climate system must
react to restore the balance. A positive radiative forcing tends to
warm the surface on average, whereas a negative radiative
forcing tends to cool it. Internal climate processes and feedbacks
may also cause variations in the radiative balance by their impact
on the reflected solar radiation or emitted infrared radiation, but
such variations are not considered part of radiative forcing.
Chapter 6 assesses the present knowledge of radiative forcing and
its variations, including the anthropogenic change of the
atmospheric composition.

When variations in the external forcing occur, the response
time of the various components of the climate system is very
different. With regard to the atmosphere, the response time of the
troposphere is relatively short, from days to weeks, whereas the
stratosphere comes into equilibrium on a time-scale of typically a
few months. Due to their large heat capacity, the oceans have a
much longer response time, typically decades but up to centuries
or millennia. The response time of the strongly coupled surface-
troposphere system is therefore slow compared with that of the
stratosphere, and is mainly determined by the oceans. The
biosphere may respond fast, e.g. to droughts, but also very slowly
to imposed changes. Therefore the system may respond to
variations in external forcing on a wide range of space- and time-
scales. The impact of solar variations on the climate provides an
example of such h externally induced climate variations.

"Many processes and interactions in the climate system are
non-linear. That means that there is no simple proportional relation
between cause and effect. A complex, non-linear system may
display what is technically called chaotic behaviour. This means
that the behaviour of the system is critically dependent on very
small changes of the initial conditions. This does not imply,
however, that the behaviour of non-linear chaotic systems is
entirely unpredictable, contrary to what is meant by “chaotic” in
colloquial language. It has, however, consequences for the nature
of its variability and the predictability of its variations. The daily
weather is a good example. The evolution of weather systems
responsible for the daily weather is governed by such non-linear
chaotic dynamics. This does not preclude successful weather
prediction, but its predictability is limited to a period of at most
two weeks. Similarly, although the climate system is highly non-
linear, the quasi-linear response of many models to present and
predicted levels of external radiative forcing suggests that the
large-scale aspects of human-induced climate change may be
predictable, although as discussed in Section 1.3.2 below,
unpredictable behaviour of non-linear systems can never be ruled
out. The predictability of the climate system is discussed in

The effect of the increasing amount of aerosols on the radiative
forcing is complex and not yet well known. The direct effect is
the scattering of part of the incoming solar radiation back into
space. This causes a negative radiative forcing which may partly,
and locally even completely, offset the enhanced greenhouse
effect. However, due to their short atmospheric lifetime, the
radiative forcing is very inhomogeneous in space and in time.
This complicates their effect on the highly non-linear climate
system. Some aerosols, such as soot, absorb solar radiation
directly, leading to local heating of the atmosphere, or absorb and
emit infrared radiation, adding to the enhanced greenhouse effect.

changes in albedo and surface roughness, and the exchange
between land and atmosphere of water vapour and greenhouse

which may lead to changes in the sources and sinks of carbon in

temperature of the surface-troposphere system would have to
increase by 1.2°C (with an accuracy of +10%), in the absence of
other changes. In reality, due to feedbacks, the response of the

overall effect of the feedbacks amplifies the temperature increase

from our limited knowledge of clouds and their interactions with

A realistic representation of the coupling between the
various components of the climate system is essential. In partic-
ular the coupling between the atmosphere and the oceans is of
central importance. The oceans have a huge heat capacity and a
decisive influence on the hydrological cycle of the climate
system, and store and exchange large quantities of carbon
dioxide. To a large degree the coupling between oceans and
atmosphere determines the energy budget of the climate system.
There have been difficulties modelling this coupling with enough
accuracy to prevent the model climate unrealistically drifting
away from the observed climate. Such climate drift may be
avoided by adding an artificial correction to the coupling, the so-
called “flux adjustment”. The evaluation in Chapter 8 of recent
model results identifies improvements since the SAR, to the point
that there is a reduced reliance on such corrections, with some
recent models operating with minimal or no adjustment.

The increase in greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations in the
atmosphere and also land-use change produces a radiative forcing
or affects processes and feedbacks in the climate system. As
discussed in Chapter 7, the response of the climate to these
human-induced forcings is complicated by such feedbacks, by
the strong non-linearity of many processes and by the fact that the
various coupled components of the climate system have very
different response times to perturbations. Qualitatively, an
increase of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations leads to
an average increase of the temperature of the surface-troposphere
system. The response of the stratosphere is entirely different. The
stratosphere is characterised by a radiative balance between
absorption of solar radiation, mainly by ozone, and emission of
infrared radiation mainly by carbon dioxide. An increase in the
carbon dioxide concentration therefore leads to an increase of the

emission and thus to a cooling of the stratosphere.

"Models of the various components of the climate system
may be coupled to produce increasingly complex models. The
historical development of such coupled climate models is shown
in Box 3 of the Technical Summary. Processes taking place on
spatial and temporal scales smaller than the model’s resolution,
such as individual clouds or convection in atmosphere models, or
heat transport through boundary currents or mesoscale eddies in
ocean models, are included through a parametric representation
in terms of the resolved basic quantities of the model. Coupled
atmosphere-ocean models, including such parametrized physical
processes, are called Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation
Models (AOGCMs). They are combined with mathematical
representations of other components of the climate system,
sometimes based on empirical relations, such as the land surface
and the cryosphere. The most recent models may include
representations of aerosol processes and the carbon cycle, and in
the near future perhaps also the atmospheric chemistry. The
development of these very complex coupled models goes hand in
hand with the availability of ever larger and faster computers to
run the models. Climate simulations require the largest, most
capable computers available.

In trying to quantify climate change, there is a fundamental

The first, so-called equilibrium method is to change, e.g.
double, the carbon dioxide concentration and to run the model
again to a new equilibrium. The differences between the climate
statistics of the two simulations provide an estimate of the
climate change corresponding to the doubling of carbon dioxide,
and of the sensitivity of the climate to a change in the radiative
forcing. This method reduces systematic errors present in both
simulations. If combined with simple slab ocean models, this
strategy is relatively cheap because it does not require long runs
to reach equilibrium. However it does not provide insight in to the
time dependence of climate change.

The quality of these simulations is assessed by systemati-
cally comparing the simulated climate with observations of the
present climate. In this way the model is evaluated and its quality
established. A range of diagnostic tools has been developed to
assist the scientists in carrying out the evaluation. This step is
essential to gain confidence in and provide a baseline for projec-
tions of human-induced climate change. Models may also be
evaluated by running them under different palaeoclimate (e.g. Ice
Age) conditions. Chapter 8 of this report presents a detailed

Projections from present models show substantial
agreement, but at the same time there is still a considerable
degree of ambiguity and difference between the various models.
All models show an increase in the globally averaged equilibrium
surface temperature and global mean precipitation. In Chapter 9
the results of various models and intercomparison projects are
assessed. Model results are more ambiguous about the spatial
patterns of climate change than about the global response.
Regional patterns depend significantly on the time dependence of
the forcing, the spatial distribution of aerosol concentrations and
details of the modelled climate processes. Research tools have
been developed to generate more reliable regional climate
information. These tools and their results are presented and

The climate system is, as we have seen, such a non-linear
complex system with many inherent time scales. Its predictability
may depend on the type of climate event considered, the time and
space scales involved and whether internal variability of the
system or variability from changes in external forcing is involved.
Internal variations caused by the chaotic dynamics of the climate
system may be predictable to some extent. Recent experience has
shown that the ENSO phenomenon may possess a fair degree of
predictability for several months or even a year ahead. The same
may be true for other events dominated by the long oceanic time-
scales, such as perhaps the NAO. On the other hand, it is not
known, for example, whether the rapid climate changes observed
during the last glacial period are at all predictable or are
unpredictable consequences of small changes resulting in major
climatic shifts.

This transient method 1 requires a time- dependent profile of
greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations. These may be
derived from so-called emission scenarios. Such scenarios have
been developed, among others by IPCC, on the basis of various
internally coherent assumptions concerning future socio-
economic and demographic developments. In the SAR the IPCC
Scenarios IS92 were used (IPCC, 1994). The most recent IPCC
emission scenarios are described in the IPCC Special Report on
Emission Scenarios (Nakicenovié et al., 2000). Different assump-
tions concerning e.g. the growth of the world population, energy
intensity and efficiency, and economic growth, lead to consider-
ably different emission scenarios. For example the two extreme
estimates in the IPCC IS92 scenarios of the carbon dioxide
emission by 2100 differ by a factor of 7. Because scenarios by
their very nature should not be used and regarded as predictions,
the term “climate projections” is used in this Report.

partly compensated for by an increasing number of satellite

for necessary high standard information. In order to implement
and improve systematic observations of all components of the

"An non-linear system such as the climate system may exhibit rapid
climate change as a response to internal processes or rapidly
changing external forcing. Because the probability of their

The abrupt events that took place during the last glacial cycle are
often cited as an example to demonstrate the possibility of such

the rapidly increasing anthropogenic forcing could be envisioned.
Examples are a possible reorganization of the thermohaline
ocean circulation in the North Atlantic resulting in a more
southerly course of the Gulf Stream, which would have a
profound influence on the climate of Western Europe, a possible
reduction of upper-level ocean cycling in the Southern Ocean, or

Having detected a climatic change, the most likely cause of
that change has to be established. This is the attribution problem.
Can one attribute the detected change to human activities, or
could it also be due to natural causes? Also attribution is a statis-
tical process. Neither detection nor attribution can ever be
“certain”, but only probable in a statistical sense. The attribution
problem has been addressed by comparing the temporal and
spatial patterns of the observed temperature increase with model
calculations based on anthropogenic forcing by greenhouse gases
and aerosols, on the assumption that these patterns carry a finger-
print of their cause. In this way the SAR found that “there is
evidence of an emerging pattern of climate response to forcing by
greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols in the observed climate
record”. Since the SAR new results have become available which
tend to support this conclusion. The present status of the
detection of climate change and attribution of its causes is

Understanding the climate response to these various radiative
forcings and projecting how they could affect future climate
requires an understanding of the physical processes and feedbacks
in the climate system and an ability to model them (Chapter 7).
The only tools available for such projections of future climate are
numerical models of the climate system of various complexity. An
evaluation of such models against observations of the present and
past climate and model intercomparisons provide the basis for
confidence in such tools (Chapter 8).

more details of climate change at a regional level, research in this
area has been particularly active over the last 5 years. A new

"¢ Analyses of mean daily maximum and minimum land surface
air temperatures continue to support a reduction in the diurnal
temperature range in many parts of the world, with, globally,
minimum temperatures increasing at nearly twice the rate of
maximum temperatures between about 1950 and 1993. The
rate of temperature increase during this time has been 0.1°C
and 0.2°C for the maximum and minimum, respectively. This
is about half of the rate of temperature increase over the
oceans during this time.

"* Confidence in the magnitude of global warming since the late
19th century has increased since the SAR due to new analyses,
including model simulations of land-surface temperature
changes and new studies of the effect of urbanisation on global
land temperature trends. There is a high level of consistency
between changes in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and near-
surface land air temperatures across the land-ocean boundary
over the 20th century, despite independent observing systems
and independent bias correction factors for SSTs before 1942.
The assessed warming is considerably larger than the total
contributions of the plausible sources of error.

imately 0.6°C since the late 19th century, with 95% confidence
limits of close to 0.4 and 0.8°C. Most of this increase has
occurred in two periods, from about 1910 to 1945 and since
1976, and the largest recent warming is in the winter extra-
tropical Northern Hemisphere. The warming rate since 1976,
0.17°C/decade, has been slightly larger than the rate of warming
during the 1910 to 1945 period (0.14°C/decade), although the
total increase in temperature is larger for the 1910 to 1945
period. The most recent warming period also has a faster rate of
warming over land compared with the oceans. The high global

"¢ Twentieth century temperature trends show a broad pattern of
tropical warming, while extra-tropical trends have been more
variable. Warming from 1910 to 1945 was initially concen-
trated in the North Atlantic and nearby regions. The Northern
Hemisphere shows cooling during the period 1946 to 1975
while the Southern Hemisphere shows warming. The recent
1976 to 2000 warming was largely globally synchronous, but
emphasised in the Northern Hemisphere continents during
winter and spring, with year-round cooling in parts of the
Southern Hemisphere oceans and Antarctica. North Atlantic
cooling between about 1960 and 1985 has recently reversed.
Overall, warming over the Southern Hemisphere has been
more uniform during the instrumental record than that over the
Northern Hemisphere.
"	List
"The best estimate of global surface temperature change is a 0.6°C
increase since the late 19th century with a 95% confidence interval
of 0.4 to 0.8°C. The increase in temperature of 0.15°C compared
to that assessed in the IPCC WGI Second Assessment Report
(IPCC, 1996) (hereafter SAR) is partly due to the additional data
for the last five years, together with improved methods of analysis
and the fact that the SAR decided not to update the value in the
First Assessment Report, despite slight additional warming. It is
likely that there have been real differences between the rate of
warming in the troposphere and the surface over the last twenty
years, which are not fully understood. New palaeoclimate analyses
for the last 1,000 years over the Northern Hemisphere indicate that
the magnitude of 20th century warming is likely to have been the
largest of any century during this period. In addition, the 1990s are
likely to have been the warmest decade of the millennium. New
analyses indicate that the global ocean has warmed significantly
since the late 1940s: more than half of the increase in heat content
has occurred in the upper 300 m, mainly since the late 1950s. The
warming is superimposed on strong global decadal variability.
Night minimum temperatures are continuing to increase, length-
ening the freeze-free season in many mid- and high latitude
regions. There has been a reduction in the frequency of extreme
low temperatures, without an equivalent increase in the frequency
of extreme high temperatures. Over the last twenty-five years, it is
likely that atmospheric water vapour has increased over the
Northern Hemisphere in many regions. There has been quite a
widespread reduction in daily and other sub-monthly time-scales
of temperature variability during the 20th century. New evidence
shows a decline in Arctic sea-ice extent, particularly in spring and
summer. Consistent with this finding are analyses showing a near
40% decrease in the average thickness of summer Arctic sea ice
over approximately the last thirty years, though uncertainties are
difficult to estimate and the influence of multi-decadal variability
cannot yet be assessed. Widespread increases are likely to have
occurred in the proportion of total precipitation derived from
heavy and extreme precipitation events over land in the mid- and
high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.

the surface and lower troposphere are real and not solely an
artefact of measurement bias, though differences in spatial and

particularly apparent in many parts of the tropics and sub-tropics
where the surface has warmed faster than the lower troposphere.

Satellites have only been available since 1979. Between 1979
and 2000, based on satellites and balloons, the lower-tropo-

0.10°C/decade, respectively. By contrast, surface temperature
trends for 1979 to 2000 were greater, at 0.16 + 0.06°C/decade.
The trend in the difference of the surface and lower-tropo-
spheric series of 0.13 + 0.06°C/decade is clearly statistically
significant. This is in contrast to near zero surface temperature
trends over 1958 to 1978 when the global lower-tropospheric
temperature warmed by 0.03°C/decade relative to the surface.

"¢ The duration of Northern Hemisphere lake-ice and river-ice
cover over the past century, or more, shows widespread
decreases averaging to about two fewer weeks of ice cover.

¢ There is a highly significant interannual (+0.6) and multi-decadal
correlation between increases in the Northern Hemisphere spring
land temperature and a reduction in the Northern Hemisphere
spring snow cover since data have been available (1966). Snow
cover extent has decreased by about 10% since 1966.

¢ A 10 to 15% reduction in sea-ice extent in the Arctic spring and
summer since the 1950s is consistent with an increase in
spring, and to a lesser extent, summer temperatures in the high
latitudes. There is little indication of reduced Arctic sea-ice
extent during winter when temperatures have increased in the
surrounding region.

¢ New data from submarines indicate that there has been about a
40% decline in Arctic sea-ice thickness in summer or early
autumn between the period 1958 to 1976 and the mid-1990s, an
average of near 4 cm per year. Other independent observations
show a much slower decrease in winter sea-ice thickness of
about | cm per year. The influence of substantial interannual
and inter-decadal variability on these changes cannot be
assessed because of restricted sampling.

¢ By contrast, there is no readily apparent relationship between
decadal changes in Antarctic temperatures and sea-ice extent
since 1973. Satellite data indicate that after a possible initial
decrease in the mid-1970s, Antarctic sea-ice extent has stayed
almost stable or even increased since 1978.

"The past millennium

¢ New analyses indicate that the magnitude of Northern
Hemispher warming over the 20th century is likely to have
been the largest of any century in the last 1,000 years.

* The 1990s are likely to have been the warmest decade of the
millennium in the Northern Hemisphere and 1998 is likely to
have been the warmest year. Because less data are available,
less is known about annual averages prior to 1,000 years before
the present and for conditions prevailing in most of the
Southern Hemisphere prior to 1861.

Evidence does not support the existence of globally synchro-
nous periods of cooling or warming associated with the ‘Little
Ice Age’ and ‘Medieval Warm Period’. However, reconstructed
Northern Hemisphere temperatures do show a cooling during
the 15th to 19th centuries and a relatively warm period during
the 11th to 14th centuries, though the latter period is still cooler
than the late 20th century.

Analyses of borehole temperatures indicate a non-linear
increase in global average ground surface temperature ovet
land of 1.0 + 0.3°C over the last 500 years, with most of the
increase occurring since the late 19th century. There may be
additional uncertainties due to the assumptions used in this
technique, and decreasing resolution back in time limits
confidence in the exact timing of the warming.

Changes across the last 500,000 years

¢ It is very likely that large and rapid decadal temperature
changes occurred during the last glacial and its deglaciation
(between about 100,000 and 10,000 years ago), particularly in
higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. During the last
deglaciation, local increases in temperature are likely to have
been as large as 5 to 10°C over a few decades. Over the same
period there is evidence of less pronounced but nearly synchro-
nous changes worldwide, except in high southern latitudes.

¢ The frequency and intensity of ENSO has been unusual since the
mid-1970s compared with the previous 100 years. Warm phase
ENSO episodes have been relatively more frequent, persistent,
or intense than the opposite cold phase during this period.

"¢ This recent behaviour of ENSO is related to variations in precip-
itation and temperature over much of the global tropics and sub-
tropics and some mid-latitude areas. The overall effect is likely
to have made a small contribution to the increase in global
surface temperature during the last few decades.
"	List
"¢ It is likely that there has been an increase in total cloud cover
of about 2% over many mid- to high latitude land areas since
the beginning of the 20th century. The increases in total cloud
amount are positively correlated with decreases in the diurnal
temperature range. Changes in total cloud amount are uncertain
both over sub-tropical and tropical land areas as well as over
the oceans.

¢ Instrumental records of land-surface precipitation continue
to show an increase of 0.5 to 1%/decade in much of the
Northern Hemisphere mid- and high latitudes. A notable
exception includes parts of eastern Russia. In contrast, over
much of the sub-tropical land areas rainfall has decreased
during the 20th century (by —0.3%/decade), but this trend has
weakened in recent decades. Other precipitation indicators
suggest that large parts of the tropical oceans have had more
precipitation in recent decades, and that precipitation has
significantly increased over tropical land areas during the
20th century (2.4%/century). The increase in precipitation
over the tropics is not evident during the past few decades.

Other Oscillations

¢ The Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation is likely to be a Pacific-
wide manifestation of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Both are
associated with decadal climate variability over the Pacific
basin. It is likely that these related phenomena modulate ENSO-
related climate variability.

The winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the associ-
ated Arctic Oscillation (AO), which appear to be largely the
same phenomenon, show decadal to multi-decadal variability.
Since the 1970s these oscillations have been in a phase that
gives stronger westerly winds over much of extra-tropical
Eurasia in the winter half year. This is associated with cold
season warming over extra-tropical Eurasia, but cooling in
some regions further south.

The High Latitude Mode (HLM) or Antarctic Oscillation (AAO)
in the Southern Hemisphere has been in an enhanced positive
phase in the last fifteen years, with stronger westerly winds over
the Southern Ocean.

It is likely that rapid (time-scales of several decades or more)
changes of atmospheric and ocean circulation occurred during
inter-glacial periods, affecting regional climate, without human
interference.

"Water vapour

¢ Changes in water vapour mixing ratio have been analysed
for selected regions using in situ surface observations as
well as lower-tropospheric measurements based on
satellites and weather balloons. A pattern of overall surface
and lower-tropospheric water vapour mixing ratio increases
over the past few decades is emerging, although there are
likely to be some time-dependent biases in these data and
regional variations in trends. The more reliable data sets
show that it is likely that total atmospheric water vapour
has increased several per cent per decade over many regions
of the Northern Hemisphere since the early 1970s. Changes
over the Southern Hemisphere cannot yet be assessed.

Satellite observations of upper-tropospheric humidity from
1980 to 1997 show statistically significant positive trends
of 0.1%/year for the zone 10°N to 10°S. Other trends are
not statistically significant, but include a 0.04%/year
positive trend for the zone 60°N to 60°S but a negative
trend of —0.1%/year over the region 30°S to 60°S.

* Balloon observations of stratospheric water vapour above
18 km show an increase of about 1%/year for the period
from 1981 to 2000. Shorter satellite records show a similar
positive trend, suggesting that the change is global in
character, but they also indicate a slowing of the positive
trend after 1996.

Throughout the chapter we try to consistently indicate the
degree of our confidence in trends and other results. Sometimes
we provide quantitative estimates of uncertainty, as far as
possible the value of twice the standard error, or we estimate
statistical significance at the 0.05 (5%) level. This is the
appropriate terminology and implies that what we see is very
unusual, given the null hypothesis. We use the word “trend” to
designate a generally progressive change in the level of a
variable. Where numerical values are given, they are equivalent
linear trends, though more complex changes in the variable will
often be clear from the description. We use the word “consistent”
to imply similarity between results or data sets that are expected
to be related on physical grounds. Where this is not possible, we
use the following words to indicate judgmental estimates of
confidence: virtually certain (>99% chance that a result is true);
very likely (290% but <99% chance); likely (>66% but <90%
chance); medium likelihood (>33% but <66% chance), unlikely
(>10% but <33% chance); very unlikely (21% but <10% chance)
and exceptionally unlikely (<1% chance).

"This chapter emphasises change against a background of
variability. The certainty of conclusions that can be drawn about
climate from observations depends critically on the availability of
accurate, complete and consistent series of observations. For
many variables important in documenting, detecting, and
attributing climate change, Karl et al. (1995a) demonstrate that
the data are still not good enough for really firm conclusions to
be reached, as noted in the IPCC WGI Second Assessment
Report (IPCC, 1996) (hereafter SAR). This especially applies to
global trends in variables that have large regional variations, such
as precipitation, whereas conclusions about temperature changes
are often considerably more firmly based. The recently
designated Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) upper air
network (Wallis, 1998) and a GCOS surface network (Peterson et
al., 1997), maintained and reporting to higher standards, may
have had a limited positive impact on the quality and availability
of some of our results. New data sets e.g., on surface humidity,
sea-ice thickness and sub-surface ocean temperature, have
widened the range of conclusions than can be drawn since the
SAR, albeit tentatively. However, a wider range of analytical
techniques and tests of the data have increased our confidence in
areas such as surface temperature changes.

The SAR reviewed the three databases of land-surface air temper-
ature due to Jones (1994), Hansen and Lebedeff (1988) and
Vinnikov et al. (1990). The first and second databases have been
updated by Jones et al. (2001) and Hansen et al. (1999), respec-
tively, and a further analysis has become available (Peterson and
Vose, 1997; Peterson et al., 1998a, 1999). The last paper also
separates rural temperature stations in the Global Historical
Climatology Network (GHCN) (Peterson and Vose, 1997) from
the full set of stations which, in common with the other three
analyses, have been screened for urbanisation effects. While there
is little difference in the long-term (1880 to 1998) rural
(0.70°C/century) and full set of station temperature trends
(actually less at 0.65°C/century), more recent data (1951 to 1989),
as cited in Peterson et al. (1999), do suggest a slight divergence
in the rural (0.80°C/century) and full set of station trends
(0.92°C/century). However, neither pair of differences is statisti-
cally significant. In addition, while not reported in Peterson et al.,
the 1951 to 1989 trend for urban stations alone was
0.10°C/decade. We conclude that estimates of long-term (1880 to
1998) global land-surface air temperature variations and trends
are relatively little affected by whether the station distribution
typically used by the four global analyses is used, or whether a
special effort is made to concentrate on rural stations using
elaborate criteria to identify them. Part of the reason for this lack
of sensitivity is that the average trends in available worldwide
urban stations for 1951 to 1989 are not greatly more than those
for all land stations (0.09°C/decade). The differences in trend
between rural and all stations are also virtually unaffected by
elimination of areas of largest temperature change, like Siberia,
because such areas are well represented in both sets of stations.

"Over global land, a further warming of surface air tempera-
ture has occurred since the SAR. The Peterson and Vose (1997)
NCDC (National Climate Data Center) series gives distinctly
more warming than does the CRU series since the mid-1980s. The
former series is a straightforward average of local land areas,
weighted according to their size, whereas the CRU series is a
simple average of the two hemispheres which gives more weight
to the relatively small area of the Southern Hemisphere land.
Because the Northern Hemisphere land has warmed considerably
faster than the Southern Hemisphere land since the mid-1980s
(reflected in Table 2.1), the simple average results in less
warming. The Hansen et al. (1999) GISS (Goddard Institute for

less warming than the CRU series since the late 1980s. One reason
for this behaviour lies in the way that the Hansen series is

"Since the 1950s both daily maximum and minimum temperatures are available over more than 50% of the global land area. These
data indicate that on average the mean minimum temperature has increased at nearly twice the rate of the maximum temperature,
reducing the daily temperature range by about 0.8°C over these areas. This has raised questions related to whether the growth of
urban heat islands may be responsible for a substantial portion of the observed mean temperature increase, because it is well-known
that compared to non-urban areas urban heat islands raise night-time temperatures more than daytime temperatures. Nonetheless,
the relatively strong correlation between observed decreases in the daily temperature range with increases of both precipitation
(leading to more moist surface conditions) and total cloud amount support the notion that the reduction in diurnal temperature range
is in response to these physical changes.

"Since 1979 satellite observations and weather balloons (which generally agree well) show substantially less warming of the global
lower troposphere (around 2 km) than surface temperatures (0.03 and 0.04°C/decade, respectively, compared to 0.16°C/decade at the
surface). However, over the Northern Hemisphere land areas where urban heat islands are most apparent, both the trends of lower-
tropospheric temperature and surface air temperature show no significant differences. In fact, the lower-tropospheric temperatures
warm at a slightly greater rate over North America (about 0.28°C/decade using satellite data) than do the surface temperatures
(0.27°C/decade), although again the difference is not statistically significant. In the global average, the trend differences arise largely
from the tropical and sub-tropical oceans. In many such regions, the near-surface marine air temperatures tend to be cool and dense

higher layers in the atmosphere. Thus the surface marine layer and the troposphere above can have differing variations and trends.

"A new record was set in all four series in 1998 (anomalies
relative to 1961 to 1990 of CRU, 0.68°C; NCDC, 0.87°C; GISS,
0.58°C; and SHI, 0.58°C). 1998 was influenced by the strong
1997/98 El Nifio; the warming influence of El Nifio on global
temperature is empirically well attested (e.g., Jones, 1994) and the
physical causes are starting to be uncovered (Meehl et al., 1998).
However, 1998 was considerably warmer than 1983, a year
warmed by the comparable 1982/83 El Nifio. In fact 1998 was
between 0.34 and 0.54°C warmer than 1983 over land, depending
on the temperature series used, though there was some offsetting
cooling from volcanic aerosols from the 1982 El Chichon eruption
in 1983. 1999 was globally much cooler than 1998, with an
anomaly of 0.40°C in the CRU series, as it was cooled by the
strongest La Nifia since 1988/89. Despite its relative coolness,
1999 was still the fifth warmest year in the CRU record. Depending
on the record used, 1999 was between 0.11°C and 0.33°C warmer
than the last comparable La Nifia year, 1989. It is noteworthy,
however, that north of 20°N, 1999 was nearly as warm as 1998.
Mitigation of the warming trend in the early 1990s was short-lived
and was mainly due to the cooling influence of the eruption of
Mount Pinatubo in 1991 (Parker er al., 1996), highlighted in the
SAR. The ten warmest years in all four records have occurred after

Northern and Southern Hemisphere land-surface air temperature
are shown in Table 2.1. Because warming may not persist at the
rates shown, all trends are shown in °C/decade. The two main
periods of warming in all three series are between about 1910 to
1945 and between 1976 to 2000 (updated from Karl et al., 2000).
Trends have been calculated using a restricted maximum likelihood
method (Diggle ef al., 1999) that allows for serial correlation in the
data. It gives larger standard errors than ordinary least squares
methods when data have a complex temporal structure, as is true
here. Table 2.1 and Figure 2.1 show that the rate of global and
hemispheric warming in land-surface air temperature from 1976 to
2000 was about twice as fast (but interannually more variable) than
that for the period 1910 to 1945. However, trends over such short
periods are very susceptible to end effects so the values in Table
2.1, and Table 2.2 below, should be viewed with caution for these
periods. Both periods of warming are statistically significant, as is
(easily) the warming since 1861 or 1901. Uncertainties in the
annual values due to data gaps, including an additional estimate of
uncertainties due to urbanisation, are included for land-surface air
temperature but equivalent uncertainties are not currently available
for the marine data alone. Thus estimates in Table 2.1 for the
marine data may be conservative, though the effect of adding the
influence of annual uncertainties to the land-surface air temp-
erature data trends was small. The period 1946 to 1975 had no
significant change of temperature, though there was a small non-
significant, but regionally more marked, cooling over the
Northern Hemisphere, as discussed by Parker et al. (1994).

Consequently, the trend in the DTR is about —0.1°C/decade. The
rate of temperature increase for both maximum and minimum
temperature over this period is greater than for the mean temper-

the increase in temperature in recent decades has involved a faster
rise in daily minimum than daily maximum temperature in many
continental regions. This gives a decrease in the diurnal tempera-

Easterling et al. (1997) increased total global coverage from 37%

however, increased almost everywhere except in eastern Canada
and small areas of Eastern Europe and the Middle East. The DTR
decreased in most areas, except over middle Canada, and parts of
southern Africa, south-west Asia, Europe, and the western tropical
Pacific Islands. In some areas the pattern of temperature change
has been different. In both New Zealand (Salinger, 1995) and
central Europe (Weber et al., 1994; Brazdil et al., 1996) maximum
and minimum temperatures have increased at similar rates. In
India the DTR has increased due to a decrease in the minimum
temperature (Kumar er al., 1994). Eastern Canada also shows a
slight increase in DTR due to a stronger cooling in maximum
temperatures relative to minimum temperatures (Easterling er al.,
1997). However, recently annual mean maximum and minimum
temperatures for Canada have been analysed using newly
homogenised data (Vincent, 1998; Vincent and Gullet, 1999);
these have increased by 0.3 and 0.4°C, respectively, over the last
fifty years (Zhang et al., 1999). Central England temperature also
shows no decrease in DTR since 1878 (Parker and Horton, 1999).
Similarly, a new temperature data set for north-east Spain (not
available on Figure 2.2 below, Brunet-India et al., 1999a,b), shows
an increase in maximum temperature over 1913 to 1998 to be
about twice as fast as that of minimum temperature. Recent
analyses by Quintana~-Gomez (1999) reveal a large reduction in
the DTR over Venezuela and Colombia, primarily due to
increasing minimum temperatures (up to 0.5°C/decade). In

in the character of the El Nifio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)

Seasonally, the strongest changes in the DTR were in the boreal

The DTR is particularly susceptible to urban effects. Gallo et
al. (1996) examined differences in DTR between stations based
on predominant land use in the vicinity of the observing site.
Results show statistically significant differences in DTR between
stations associated with predominantly rural land use/land cover
and those associated with more urban land use/land cover, with
tural settings generally having larger DTR than urban settings.
Although this shows that the distinction between urban and rural
land use is important as one of the factors that can influence the
trends observed in temperatures, Figure 2.2 shows annual mean
trends in diurnal temperature range in worldwide non-urban
stations over the period 1950 to 1993 (from Easterling et al.,
1997). The trends for both the maximum and minimum tempera-
tures are about 0.005°C/decade smaller than the trends for the full
network including urban sites, which is consistent with earlier
estimated urban effects on global temperature anomaly time-
series (Jones et al., 1990).

Many historical in situ marine data still remain to be
digitised and incorporated into the database, to improve coverage
and reduce the uncertainties in our estimates of marine climatic
variations. A combined physical-empirical method (Folland and
Parker, 1995) is used, as in the SAR, to estimate adjustments to
ships’ SST data obtained up to 1941 to compensate for heat losses
from uninsulated (mainly canvas) or partly-insulated (mainly
wooden) buckets (see Box 2.2). The corrections are independent
of the land-surface air temperature data. Confirmation that these
spatially and temporally complex adjustments are quite realistic
globally is emerging from simulations of the Jones (1994) land-
surface air temperature anomalies using the Hadley Centre
atmospheric climate model HadAM3 forced with observed SST
and sea-ice extents since 1871, updated from Rayner ef al.

Figure 2.5a shows annual values of global SST, using a
recently improved UKMO analysis that does not fill regions of
missing data (Jones ef al., 2001), together with decadally
smoothed values of SST from the same analysis. NMAT is also
shown. These generally agree well after 1900, but NMAT data
are warmer before that time with a slow cooling trend from 1860
not seen in the SSTs, though the minimum around 1910 is seen
in both series. The SST analysis from the SAR is also shown. The
changes in SST since the SAR are generally fairly small, though
the peak warmth in the early 1940s is more evident in the more
recent analysis, supported by the NMAT analysis. A contribution
to decadally averaged global warmth at that time is likely to have
arisen from closely spaced multiple El Nifio events centred near
1939 to 1941 and perhaps 1942 to 1944 (Bigg and Inonue, 1992;
and Figure 2.29). The NMAT data largely avoid daytime heating
of ships’ decks (Bottomley ef al., 1990; Folland and Parker,
1995). Although NMAT data have been corrected for warm
biases in World War II they may still be too warm in the Northern
Hemisphere at that time (Figure 2.5c), though there is good
agreement in the Southern Hemisphere (Figure 2.5d). The
NMAT analysis is based on that in Parker et al. (1995) but differs
from that used in the SAR in that it incorporates optimal inter-
polated data using orthogonal spatial patterns (eigenvectors).
This is similar to the technique described by Kaplan et al. (1997,
1998) but with additional allowance for non-stationarity of the
data (Parker et al, 1995). Great care is needed in making these
reconstructions in a changing climate, as pointed out by Hurrell
and Trenberth (1999). This NMAT analysis has been chosen
because of the often very sparse data. NMAT confirms the SST
trends in the 20th century until 1991 (see also Table 2.1). After
1991, NMAT warmed at a slower rate than SST in parts of the
Southern Hemisphere, notably the South Indian and the tropical
South Pacific Oceans. Overall, however, the SST data should be
regarded as more reliable, though the relative changes in NMAT
since 1991 may be partly real (Christy er al., 2001). The similar
trends in SST and island air temperature found by Folland er al.
(1997) for four regions of the tropical and extra-tropical South
Pacific over much of the last century support the generally greater
reliability of the SST data.

Particularly strong warming has occurred in the extra-
tropical North Atlantic since the mid-1980s (approximately 35°
to 65°N, 0° to 35°W not shown). This warming appears to be
related in part to the warming phase of a multi-decadal fluctua-

Up to 1981, the Quayle ef al series is based on the UKMO series,
adjusted by linear regression to match the NCEP series after 1981.
It has a truly global coverage based on the optimally interpolated
Reynolds and Smith data. The Kaplan et al. (1998) global analysis
is not shown because it makes no allowance for non-stationarity
(here the existance of global warming) in its optimum interpola-
tion procedures, as noted by Hurrell and Trenberth (1999). The
warmest year globally in each SST record was 1998 (UKMO,
0.43°C, NCDC, 0.39°C, and NCEP, 0.34°C, above the 1961 to
1990 average). The latter two analyses are in principle affected by
artificially reduced trends in the satellite data (Hurrell and
Trenberth, 1999), though the data we show include recent
attempts to reduce this. The global SST show mostly similar
trends to those of the land-surface air temperature until 1976, but
the trend since 1976 is markedly less (Table 2.1). NMAT trends
are not calculated from 1861, as they are too unreliable. The
difference in trend between global SST and global land air
temperature since 1976 does not appear to be significant, but the
trend in NMAT (despite any residual data problems) does appear
to be less than that in the land air temperature since 1976. Figures
2.5c and d show that NMAT and SST trends remain very similar
in the Northern Hemisphere to the end of the record, but diverge
rather suddenly in the Southern Hemisphere from about 1991, as
mentioned above. The five warmest years in each of the UKMO,
NCDC and NCEP SST analyses have occurred after 1986, four of
them in the 1990s in the UKMO analysis.

"Figure 2.6 summarises the relative changes of UKMO SST,
UKMO NMAT and CRU land-surface air temperature. The
greater warming of the land in recent years is clear, but otherwise
all three curves have a generally similar shape except that modest
cooling of NMAT in the late 19th century is not seen in the SST
data as noted for Figure 2.5. The relative coldness of the land
around 1885 to 1895 comes from the Northern Hemisphere
continental interiors, particularly in winter, as global coastal land
air temperature and adjacent SST anomalies agree well at this
time (Parker et al., 1995), confirmed by the Jones er al. (2001)
data. Note that there are some systematic compensating differ-
ences between the land and SST in the late 19th century in both
hemispheres (not shown). The CRU land data are generally about
0.1 to 0.2°C colder in the Northern Hemisphere except at the
beginning of the record (early 1860s), when they agree, and
rather colder than this in 1885 to 1890. The opposite is seen in the
Southern Hemisphere before 1885 when SST is generally 0.1 to
0.2°C colder and 0.3°C colder around 1875. Overall the SST data
are less variable in each hemisphere in these rather poorly
observed periods. The Southern Hemisphere land temperature at
this time can actually represent a very small observed area of the
hemisphere while the SST data, though sparse, are generally
considerably more widespread. The sharp cooling in SST around
1903/4 in Figures 2.5 and 2.6, seen in the land as well as the two
ocean surface data sets, was discussed for the North Atlantic and
Indian Oceans by Helland-Hansen and Nansen (1920) not long
after the event. The reduced warming of the NMAT in the last
decade reflects differences in the Southern Hemisphere discussed
above. Slightly greater warming of the global ocean than the

"The SST data used here comprise over 80 million observations from the UK Main Marine Data Bank, the United States
Comprehensive Ocean Atmosphere Data Set (COADS) and recent information telecommunicated from ships and buoys from the
World Weather Watch. These observations have been carefully checked for homogeneity and carefully corrected for the use of
uninsulated wooden and canvas buckets for collecting seawater prior to 1942. However, corrections prior to about 1900 are less
well known because of uncertainties in the mix of wooden and canvas buckets. Nevertheless, Figure 2.4 provides good evidence
that even in the 1870s, SST was little biased relative to land-surface air temperatures globally. Since 1941, observations mainly
come from ship engine intake measurements, better insulated buckets and, latterly, from buoys. SST anomalies (from a 1961 to
1990 average) are first averaged into 1° latitude by 1° longitude boxes for five-day periods; the anomaly for a given observation is
calculated from a 1° box climatology that changes each day throughout the year. The five-day 1° box anomalies are then aggregated
into 5° boxes for the whole month with outlying values rejected, and monthly average anomalies calculated. Further adjustments
are made to monthly SST anomalies for the varying numbers of observations in each 5° box because when observations are few,
random errors tend to increase the variance of the monthly mean. NMAT data are treated similarly and have quite similar charac-
teristics. However, a variance adjustment to NMAT data is not yet made. NMAT data are also corrected for the progressive increase
in the height of thermometer screens on ships above the ocean surface, though no corrections have been made since 1930. Because
there are only about half as many NMAT as SST data and NMAT have smaller temporal persistence, monthly NMAT anomalies
may be less representative than SST anomalies even on quite large space scales. On longer time-scales, and over the majority of
large ocean regions in the 20th century, there is good agreement between NMAT and SST. 19th century NMAT anomaly time-
series should be viewed cautiously because of the sparse character of the constituent observations, and regionally varying biases,
only some of which have been corrected.

1901 to 2000, the equivalent values are 0.058°C/decade or a

amount. However both the earlier period of warming (1910 to

was continued (non-significant) warming in the Southern
Hemisphere, though at a reduced rate, in 1946 to 1975, which
partially offset (non-significant) cooling in the Northern
Hemisphere over the same period to give a (non-significant)
0.03°C cooling globally. The global trend from 1861 to 2000 can
be cautiously interpreted as an equivalent linear warming of

Figure 2.8 shows a smoothed optimally averaged annual
global time-series with estimates of uncertainty at + twice the
standard error of the smoothed (near decadal) estimate. Note that
the optimum average uncertainties increase in earlier years
mainly because of the much larger data gaps. Also shown are
uncertainties estimated by Jones et al. (1997b) using a different
method centred on the Jones et al. (2001) land and sea surface
temperature series. This series uses the average of anomalies from
all available grid boxes, weighted according to grid box area.
Therefore, in contrast to the Jones et al. (2001) global land-
surface air temperature data, the global land and sea surface
temperature data are not a simple average of the hemispheres. The
optimally averaged uncertainties vary from about 15 to 65% less
than those given by Jones et al. (1997b). This is reasonable as
optimum averages have minimum variance amongst the range of
unbiased estimates of the average. Not surprisingly, there is
relatively little difference in the decadal averages themselves.
However unlike the Jones ef al. estimates of uncertainty, the
optimum average also includes uncertainties in bias corrections to
SST up to 1941 (Folland and Parker, 1995) and the uncertainties
(as included in Figure 2.1) in the land data component that are due
to urbanisation. Cessation of the SST component of uncertainty
after 1941 is the reason for a lack of increase in uncertainties in
the fairly poorly observed period 1942 to 1945. Uncertainties due
to changes in thermometer screens are poorly known but could be
0.1°C globally in the 19th and early 20th centuries (Parker, 1994);
they are not included here, but a preliminary analysis appears in
Folland et al. (2001). For further discussion of changes in land
and ocean surface temperature, see Jones ef al. (1999a).

Most of the warming in the 20th century occurred in two distinct
periods separated by several decades of little overall globally
averaged change, as objectively identified by Karl et al. (2000)
and discussed in IPCC (1990, 1992, 1996) and several references
quoted therein. Figures 2.9 and 2.10 highlight the worldwide
behaviour of temperature change in the three periods. These linear
trends have been calculated from the Jones er al. (2001) gridded
combination of UKMO SST and CRU land-surface air tempera-
ture, from which the trends in Table 2.2 were calculated. Optimum

change), 1976 to 2000 (second warming period, where all four
seasons are shown in Figure 2.10) and the 20th century, 1901 to
2000. It can be seen that there is a high degree of local consistency
between the SST and land air temperature across the land-ocean
boundary, noting that the corrections to SST (Folland and Parker,
1995) are independent of the land data. The consistency with
which this should be true locally is not known physically, but is
consistent with the similarity of larger-scale coastal land and
ocean surface temperature anomalies on decadal time-scales
found by Parker et al. (1995). The warming observed in the period
from 1910 to 1945 was greatest in the Northern Hemisphere high
latitudes, as discussed in Parker er al. (1994). By contrast, the

Faster warming of the land-surface temperature than the

ocean surface temperature in the last two decades, evident in
Figure 2.6, could in part be a signal of anthropogenic warming (see
Chapters 9 and 12). However, a component, at least in the Northern
Hemisphere north of 40 to 45°N, may result from the sharp
increase in the positive phase of the winter half year North Atlantic
Oscillation (NAO)/Arctic Oscillation (AO) since about 1970
(Section 2.6.5), though this itself might have an anthropogenic
component (Chapter 7). There has also been a strong bias to the
warm phase of El Nifio since about 1976 (Section 2.6.2). In partic-
ular, Hurrell and van Loon (1997) and Thompson et al. (2000a)
show that the positive phase of the NAO advects additional warm
air over extra-tropical Eurasia north of about 45°N. The positive
phase of the NAO or AO is therefore likely to be a major cause of

"the winter half-year warming in Siberia and northern Europe in
Figure 2.10, as also quantified by Hurrell (1996). Cooling over the
western North Atlantic Ocean also occurs, partly due to advection
of cold air in an enhanced north to north-west airflow. Hurrell
(1996) also shows that the warm phase of El Nifio is associated
with widespread extra-tropical continental warming, particularly
over North America and parts of Siberia, with cooling over the
North Pacific Ocean. Both effects are consistent with the strong
warming over Siberia in winter in 1976 to 2000 (Figure 2.10),
warming over much of North America and cooling over the Davis
Strait region. Note that some regional details of the seasonal trends
for 1976 to 2000 in Figure 2.10 may be sensitive to small changes
in record length. A test for the shorter period 1980 to 1997 showed
the same general worldwide pattern of (generally somewhat
reduced) seasonal warming trends as in Figure 2.10, but with some
regional changes, particularly over North America, almost
certainly related to atmospheric circulation fluctuations. However,
Siberian trends were considerably more robust.

The winter and spring mixed-layer depths over the sub-tropical
gyre of the North Pacific deepened 30 to 80% over the period
1960 to 1988 (Polovina ef al., 1995). Over the sub-polar gyre,
mixed-layer depths reduced by 20 to 30% over the same period.
The surface layer of the sub-polar gyre in the north-east Pacific
has both warmed and freshened, resulting in a lower surface
density (Freeland et al., 1997). Wong et al. (1999) compared
trans-Pacific data from the early 1990s to historical data collected

salinity are consistent with surface warming and freshening at
mid- and higher latitudes and the subsequent subduction
(downward advection) of these changes into the thermocline.
From 1968/69 and 1990/91, the South Pacific waters beneath the
base of the thermocline have cooled and freshened (Johnson and
Orsi, 1997); the greatest cooling and freshening of —1.0°C and
0.25, respectively, occurred near 48°S and were still observed at

North Atlantic deep waters begin as intermediate waters in
the Nordic seas. These waters have freshened over the 1980s and
1990s (Bonisch et al., 1997). In addition, the absence of deep
convection over the same period has caused Nordic Sea bottom
waters to become warmer, saltier and less dense. The Faroes-
Shetland Channel is the principal pathway between the north-east
Atlantic and the Norwegian Sea and has been surveyed regularly
since 1893 (Turrell et al., 1999). Unfortunately, the quality of the
salinity measurements was poor from 1930 through to 1960.
Since the mid-1970s, the intermediate and bottom waters
entering the North Atlantic through the channel have freshened at
rates of 0.02/decade and 0.01/decade, respectively. The decreased
salinities have resulted in decreased water densities and a
decrease of between | and 7%/decade in the transport of deep
water into the North Atlantic.

1954 to 1922 using nearby observations. They find an almost
constant rate of warming over the 1,500 to 2,500 dbar layer of
0.05°C/decade over the 73-year period 1922 to 1995. This
corresponds to a net downward heat flux of 0.7 Wm”. Sections
completed in 1958, 1985 and 1997 along 52°W and 66°W
between 20°N to 35°N (Joyce et al., 1999) show a rate of
warming of 0.06°C/decade, similar to that seen at Bermuda but
averaged over a larger 1,700 m depth interval. Trans-Atlantic
sections along 24°N in 1957, 1981 and 1992 show a similar
warming between 800 and 2,500 m (Parrilla et al., 1994; Bryden

arate of 0.1°C/decade. At 8°N between 1957 and 1993, Arhan et

"The longest data sets of upper air temperature are derived from
instruments carried aloft by balloons (radiosondes). Changes in
balloon instrumentation and data processing over the years have
been pervasive, however, resulting in discontinuities in these
temperature records (Gaffen, 1994; Parker and Cox, 1995; Parker
et al., 1997). Gaffen et al. (2000b) attempted to identify these
biases by using statistical tests to determine “change-points” —
sudden temperature shifts not likely to be of natural origin (e.g.,
instrument changes). However, they found that alternative
methods for identifying change points yield different trend
estimates and that the analysis was hampered by the lack of
complete documentation of instrument and data processing
changes for many stations. This study, however, only analysed
change points in the time-series of individual stations in isolation.
Another technique, used successfully with surface data, relies on
differences produced from comparisons among several stations in
close proximity. In addition, Santer et al. (1999) noted that temper-
ature trends estimated from radiosonde data sets are sensitive to
how temperature shifts are dealt with, which stations are utilised,
and the method used for areal averaging.

The principle of reanalysis is to use observations in the data
assimilation scheme of a fixed global weather forecasting model
to create a dynamically consistent set of historical atmospheric
analyses (Kalnay et al., 1996). Within the assimilation scheme,
potentially errant data are amended or excluded using compar-
isons with neighbours and/or calculated conditions. However,
small, time-dependent biases in the observations, of magnitudes
important for climate change, are virtually impossible to detect in
the model, even in areas of adequate in situ data. Furthermore, in
areas with few in situ data the reanalyses are often affected by
inadequate model physics or satellite data for which time-varying

satellites (NOAA-12, 1991 to 1998) the non-linear calibration
coefficients were erroneous, affecting MSU 2 and MSU 2LT.
Wentz and Schabel (1998) discovered that satellite orbit decay
introduces gradual, spurious cooling in MSU 2LT. Christy et al.

the laboratory assessments and on-orbit performance, requiring
further corrections. Additional adjustments were also made by
recalculating and removing spurious temperature trends due to

Characteristics, such as spatial coverage, of each data set
derived from the weather balloon data are different. For example,
Sterin (1999) used data from over 800 stations from the CARDS
and telecommunicated data sets, with only gross spatial and
temporal consistency checks. The data were objectively interpo-
lated to all unobserved regions, introducing extra uncertainty.
Parker et al. (1997) placed CLIMAT TEMP data into 5° latitude x
10° longitude grid boxes from about 400 sites, leaving unobserved
boxes missing. Further data sets were created employing limited
spatial interpolation and bias-adjustments, but uncertainties related
to spatial under-sampling remain (Hurrell er al., 2000). Angell
(1988) placed observations from 63 stations into seven broad latitu-
dinal bands, calculated the simple average for each band and

"Data sets generated from rocketsondes have been updated

with these data due to different types of instrumentation, tidal
cycles (amplitude 2°C) and to assumed corrections for aerody-
namic heating. The last set of adjustments has the most significant
impact on trends. The approximately | 1-year solar cycle forces a
temperature perturbation of >1°C in the mid- to upper strato-

surface to about 18 km, hence including some stratospheric

including some tropical tropospheric emissions) (Christy ef al.,

construct these MSU data sets. It is important to note that the
troposphere and stratosphere are two distinct layers of the
atmosphere with substantially different temperature variations and

varies with latitude, being about 16 to 17 km in the tropics but only

Uncertainties arising from measurement errors due to the
factors discussed in Section 2.2.3, including incomplete spatial
sampling, can be substantial. One estimate of this uncertainty can
be made from comparisons between the various analyses in Table
2.3. For trends below 300 hPa, this uncertainty may be as large as
+ 0.10°C/decade since 1979, though Christy et al. (2000) estimate
the 95% confidence interval as + 0.06°C for the MSU 2LT layer
average. For example, Santer ef al. (2000) find that when the
satellite observations from MSU 2LT are masked to match the less
than complete global coverage of the surface observations during
the past few decades, the differences in the trends between the

surface and the troposphere are reduced by about one third.

since 1958, estimated from a sparser radiosonde network, is

the data are perfectly known because trends calculated for short

longer term, due to large interannual to decadal variations. Thus
confidence intervals for estimates of trend since 1979 due to
temporal sampling uncertainty can be relatively large, as high as
+ 0.2°C/decade below 300 hPa (Table 2.3, Santer et al., 2000).

Summarising, it is very likely that the surface has warmed in
the global average relative to the troposphere, and the
troposphere has warmed relative to the stratosphere since 1979
(Figure 2.12a,b; Pielke et al., 1998a,b; Angell, 1999, 2000;
Brown et al., 2000; Christy et al., 2000; Gaffen er al., 2000a;
Hurrell et al., 2000; NRC, 2000; Stendel et al., 2000). However,
the relative warming is spatially very variable and most signifi-
cant in the tropics and sub-tropics. There is evidence that the
troposphere warmed relative to the surface in the pre-satellite era
(1958 to 1979, see Brown et al., 2000; Gaffen et al., 2000a),
though confidence in this finding is lower. Uncertainties due to
limited temporal sampling prevent confident extrapolation of
these trends to other or longer time periods (Christy et al., 2000;
Hurrell et al., 2000; NRC, 2000; Santer er al., 2000). Some
physical explanations for changes in the vertical profile of global
temperature trends are discussed in Chapter 12 but a full explana-
tion of the lower-tropospheric lapse rate changes since 1958
requires further research.

Between 1979 and 2000, the magnitude of trends between the

surface and MSU 2LT is generally most similar in many parts of
the Northern Hemisphere extra-tropics (20°N to pole) where deep
vertical mixing is often a characteristic of the troposphere. For
example, the northern extra-tropical trends for the surface and
MSU 2LT were 0.28 and 0.21°C/decade, respectively, and over
the North American continent trends were 0.27 + 0.24 and 0.28
+ 0.23°C/decade, respectively, with an annual correlation of 0.92.
Over Europe the rates were 0.38 + 0.36 and 0.38 + 0.30°C/decade,
respectively. Some additional warming of the surface relative to
the lower troposphere would be expected in the winter half year
over extra-tropical Asia (whole year warming rates of 0.35 + 0.20
and 0.18 + 0.18°C/decade, respectively), consistent with the
vertical temperature structure of the increased positive phase of
the Arctic Oscillation (Thompson er al., 2000a, Figure 2.30). The
vertical structure of the atmosphere in marine environments,
however, generally reveals a relatively shallow inversion layer
(surface up to 0.7 to 2 km) which is somewhat decoupled from
the deep troposphere above (Trenberth et al., 1992; Christy,
1995; Hurrell and Trenberth, 1996). Not only are local surface
versus tropospheric correlations often near zero in these
regions, but surface and tropospheric trends can be quite
different (Chase et al., 2000). This is seen in the different trends
for the period 1979 to 2000 in the tropical band, 0.10 + 0.10 and
—0.06 + 0.16°C/decade, respectively (Table 2.3) and also in the
southern extra-tropics where the trends are 0.08 + 0.06 and —0.05
+ 0.08°C/decade, respectively. Trends calculated for the differ-
ences between the surface and the troposphere for 1979 to 2000
are statistically significant globally at 0.13 + 0.06°C/decade, and
even more so in the tropics at 0.17 + 0.06°C/decade. Statistical
significance arises because large interannual variations in the
parent time-series are strongly correlated and so largely disappear
in the difference time-series (Santer et al., 2000; Christy er al.,
2001). However, as implied above, they are not significant over
many extra-tropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere such as
North America and Europe and they are also insignificant in some
Southern Hemisphere areas. The sequence of volcanic eruption,
ENSO events, and the trends in the Arctic Oscillation have all
been linked to some of this difference in warming rates (Michaels
and Knappenburg, 2000; Santer et al., 2000; Thompson et al.,
2000a; Wigley, 2000) and do explain a part of the difference in the
rates of warming (see Chapter 12).

Reconstructions for North America suggest that while there
has been a general decrease in spring SCE since 1915, it is likely
that winter SCE has increased (Brown and Goodison, 1996; Frei
et al., 1999; Hughes and Robinson, 1996; Hughes et al., 1996).
Similar to the results in North America, in Eurasia April SCE has
significantly decreased; but lack of data has prevented an analysis
of winter trends (Brown, 2000). Over Canada, there has been a
general decrease in snow depth since 1946, especially during
spring, in agreement with decreases in SCE (Brown and Braaten,
1998). Winter depths have declined over European Russia since
1900 (Meshcherskaya er al., 1995), but have increased elsewhere
over Russia in the past few decades (Fallot et al., 1997). The
common thread between studies that have examined seasonality is
an overall reduction in spring snow cover in the latter half of the
20th century.

Over the period 1979 to 1996, the Antarctic (Cavalieri et al.,
1997; Parkinson ef al., 1999) shows a weak increase of 1.3 +
0.2%/decade. Figure 2.16 (for 1973 to 1998) shows a new

for the new European Centre for Medium-range Weather
Forecasts (ECMWF) 40-year reanalysis that extends the record
back to 1973. While showing the same weak increase after 1979,
it also suggests greater ice extents in the mid-1970s. Although
century scale time-series cannot be constructed for the Antarctic,
de la Mare (1997) has used whaling ship logs to infer significantly
greater ice extent in the Southern Ocean during the 1930s and
1940s than during recent decades. The indirect nature of the
earlier evidence, however, introduces substantial uncertainty into
this conclusion.

Hemispheric and regional data sets for the Arctic enable the
satellite-derived trends in Figure 2.14 to be placed into a century
scale context. Figure 2.15 shows annual time-series of the Northern
Hemisphere ice extent by season from 1901 to 1999 using in situ
data before the satellite era (Vinnikov et al., 1999a). It should be
emphasised that the spatial coverage of earlier data is not complete,
with the largest data voids in the autumn and winter. Because few
data were available, the variability of the autumn and wintertime
series in Figure 2.15 is smaller during the early decades of the
century. Essentially no data for summer and autumn are available
for the World War II period. The summer decrease that is largely
responsible for the overall downward trend during the satellite era
is present during the entire second half of the 20th century (Figure
2.15). This decrease represents about 15% of the average summer
extent in the first half of the 20th century. Spring values show a
somewhat weaker negative trend over the same period with a total
reduction of near 8%, but there is only a slight and uncertain
downward trend in autumn and winter since about 1970.

from an USA civilian submarine research programme with data
from six summer cruises from the period 1958 to 1976. Thickness
was adjusted to mid-September values to account for seasonal
variability. The significant decline in mean ice thickness was
observed for all regions, increasing from the Canada Basin towards
Europe (Figure 2.17). Overall, there was a mean reduction in
thickness of 42% from 3. 1 to 1.8 m the earlier ier period to to the present.

Vinje et al. (1998) measured the thickness of ice exiting the
Arctic Ocean through Fram Strait from 1990 to 1996 using
moored upward looking sonars and reported a rather different
result. The mean annual ice thickness in Fram Strait varied from
2.64 to 3.41 m. These observations were consistent with Arctic
Ocean-wide ice thickness estimates made by drilling from Soviet
Ice Stations from 1972 to 1981 and from submarine transects
from 1960 to 1982, suggesting little change in ice thickness from
the 1960s and 1970s to the 1990s.

In North America, the southern boundary of the discontinuous
permafrost zone has migrated northward in response to warming

Vitt et al., 1994; Halsey er al., 1995; Laberge and Payette, 1995;

About 25% of the land mass of the Northern Hemisphere is
underlain by permafrost, including large regions of Canada, China,
Russia and Alaska, with smaller permafrost areas in mountain
chains of many other countries in both the Northern and Southern
Hemisphere (Brown et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 1999). Permafrost
in large part depends on climate. Over half of the world’s
permafrost is at temperatures a few degrees below 0°C.
Temperature variations in near-surface permafrost (20 to 200 m
depth) can be used as a sensitive indicator of the inter-annual and
decade-to-century climatic variability and long-term changes in the
surface energy balance (Lachenbruch and Marshall, 1986;
Lachenbruch et al., 1988; Clow et al., 1991; Beltrami and Taylor,
1994; Majorowicz and Judge, 1994). Very small changes in surface
climate can produce important changes in permafrost tempera-
tures. Lachenbruch and Marshall (1986) used climate reconstruc-
tions from deep (>125 m depth) temperature measurements in
permafrost to show that there has been a general warming of the
permafrost in the Alaskan Arctic of 2 to 4°C over the last century.

Long-term monitoring of shallow permafrost began in
earnest in the last few decades. Recent analyses indicate that
permafrost in many regions of the earth is currently warming
(Gravis et al., 1988; Haeberli et al., 1993; Osterkamp, 1994;
Pavlov, 1994; Wang and French, 1994; Ding, 1998; Sharkhuu,
1998; Vonder Miihll et al., 1998; Weller and Anderson, 1998;
Osterkamp and Romanovsky, 1999; Romanovsky and
Osterkamp, 1999). However, the onset, magnitude (from a few
tenths to a few degrees centigrade) and rate of warming varies
regionally, and not all sites in a given region show the same trend
(Osterkamp and Romanovsky, 1999). This variability, as well as
short-term (decadal or less) trends superimposed on long-term
(century) trends, is briefly discussed in Serreze et al. (2000).
There has also been evidence of recent permafrost cooling into
the mid-1990s in parts of north-eastern and north-western
Canada (Allard et al., 1995; Burn, 1998). However, there are
regional data gaps, such as in the central and high Arctic in North
America. A new international permafrost thermal monitoring
network (Burgess et al., 2000) is being developed to help address
these gaps and document the spatial and temporal variability
across the globe.

"We first discuss mass balance observations. The specific mass
balance is defined as the net annual gain or loss of mass at the
glacier surface, per unit area of the surface. The mass balance
averaged over an entire glacier is denoted by B,,. Systematic
investigations of glacier mass balance started after 1945, so these
records are shorter than the instrumental climate records normally
available in the vicinity. In contrast to frequently made statements,
B, is not necessarily a more precise indicator of climate change
than is glacier length. Time-series of B,, do contain year-to-year
variability reflecting short-term fluctuations in meteorological
quantities but of concern on longer time-scales is the effect of
changing glacier geometry. A steadily retreating glacier will get
thinner and the mass balance will become more negative because
of a slowly increasing surface air temperature due to a lowering
surface that is not reflected in a large-scale temperature signal.
Climatic interpretation of long-term trends in of mass balance data
requires the use of coupled mass balance-ice flow models to
separate the climatic and geometric parts of the signal. Such studies
have only just begun. However, mass balance observations are
needed for estimating the contribution of glacier melt to sea level
rise, so are discussed further in Chapter 11.

The last point is of particular interest in the light of the
discrepancy between recent tropical glacier length reduction and
lack of warming in the lower troposphere since 1979 indicated by
satellites and radiosondes in the tropics (Section 2.2.3). Long-
term monitoring of glacier extent provides abundant evidence
that tropical glaciers are receding at an increasing rate in all
tropical mountain areas. This applies to the tropical Andes
(Brecher and Thompson, 1993; Hastenrath and Ames, 1995;
Ames, 1998), Mount Kenya and Kilimanjaro (Hastenrath and
Kruss, 1992; Hastenrath and Greischar, 1997) and to the glaciers

Relating mass balance fluctuations to meteorological
conditions is more complicated for tropical glaciers than for mid-
and high latitude glaciers, and it has not been demonstrated that
temperature is the most important factor. Nevertheless, the fast
glacier recession in the tropics seems at first sight to be consistent
with an increase in tropical freezing heights of 100 m over the
period 1970 to 1986 as reported by Diaz and Graham (1996),
corresponding to an increase of 0.5°C at tropical high mountain
levels, which they also link to increases in tropical SST since the
mid-1970s (Figure 2.10). However, although Gaffen et al. (2000)
found a similar increase over 1960 to 1997, they found a lowering
of freezing level over 1979 to 1997 which, at least superficially,
is not consistent with glacier recession.

On the global scale, air temperature is considered by most
glaciologists to be the most important factor reflecting glacier
retreat. This is based on calculations with mass balance models
(Greuell and Oerlemans, 1987; Oerlemans, 1992; Fleming et al.,
1997; Johannesson, 1997). For a typical mid-latitude glacier, a
30% decrease in cloudiness or a 25% decrease in precipitation
would have the same effect as a 1°C temperature rise. Such
changes in cloudiness or precipitation can occur locally or even
regionally on a decadal time-scale associated with changes in
circulation, but global trends of this size on a century time-scale
are very unlikely. As mentioned in the SAR, Oerlemans (1994)
concluded that a warming rate of 0.66 + 0.20°C per century at the
mean glacier altitude could explain the linear part of the observed
retreat of 48 widely distributed glaciers.

New analyses of mean daily maximum and minimum temper-

range with minimum temperatures increasing at about twice the
rate of maximum temperatures over the second half of the 20th
century. Seasonally, the greatest warming since 1976 over land has
occurred during the Northern Hemisphere winter and spring, but
significant warming has also occurred in the Northern Hemisphere
summer. Southern Hemisphere warming has also been strongest
during the winter over land, but little difference between the
seasons is apparent when both land and oceans are considered. The
largest rates of warming continue to be found in the mid- and high

instrumental temperature data (Figure 2.1), and the combined

clear warming is not seen until the beginning of the 20th century.
This conclusion also conflicts with some (but not all) of the

Numerous studies suggest the importance of lake and river ice
break-up as an index of climate variability and change, especially
as related to temperature and snow cover (Palecki and Barry,
1986; Schindler et al., 1990; Robertson et al., 1992; Assel and
Robertson, 1995; Anderson et al., 1996; Wynne et al., 1998;
Magnuson et al., 2000). Records of lake and river ice can be used
to independently evaluate changes of temperature and, to some
extent, snow cover. Like other proxy measurements they have
limitations, and are subject to their own time-dependent biases
such as changes in observers and protocols related to the identi-
fication of “ice on” and “ice off’ conditions. Larger lakes often
have the best records, but are often located near human settle-
ments which can affect the homogeneity of the record, e.g.,
associated cooling water discharges and urban heat islands, so
care is needed to select suitable lakes.

For the last two to three decades, far more records have been
available than are shown in Figure 2.18. Many are documented at
the World Glacier Monitoring Service in Ziirich, Switzerland
(e.g., IAHS (ICSD/UNEP/UNESCO, 1998) The general picture
is one of widespread retreat, notably in Alaska, Franz-Josef Land,
Asia, the Alps, Indonesia and Africa, and tropical and sub-
tropical regions of South America. In a few regions a consider-
able number of glaciers are currently advancing (e.g., Western
Norway, New Zealand). In Norway this is very likely to be due to
increases in precipitation owing to the positive phase of the North
Atlantic Oscillation (Section 2.6), and in the Southern Alps of
New Zealandand due to wetter conditions with little warming
since about 1980. Finally, indications in the European Alps that
current glacier recession is reaching levels not seen for perhaps a
few thousand years comes from the exposure of radiocarbon-
dated ancient remains in high glacial saddles. Here there is no
significant ice flow and melting is assumed to have taken place in
situ for the first time in millennia (e.g., the finding of the 5,000-
year-old Oetzal “ice man”).

"A significant relationship has been found between interannual
variations (correlation = —0.60) of the Northern Hemisphere
snow-cover extent and land-surface air temperature in spring
since the 1960s. However, the observed increase in temperature
during the winter is not reflected in a reduced snow-cover extent.
Reduced ice cover on the Northern Hemisphere lakes and rivers,
primarily due to earlier onset in spring of ice-free conditions
during the 20th century, is consistent with reduced snow cover
extent in that season. Sea-ice retreat in the Arctic spring and
summer is also consistent with an increase in spring, and to a
lesser extent, summer temperatures in the high northern latitudes.
Summer temperature increases have been less than in spring in
nearby land areas, but Arctic sea-ice extent and especially
thickness have markedly decreased. Nevertheless, there is only a
small indication of reduced Arctic sea ice during winter when
temperatures have also increased. Antarctic sea-ice extent has not
decreased since the late 1970s, possibly related to recent indica-
tions of little change in Antarctic temperatures over much of the
continent in that period . There is now ample evidence to support
a major retreat of most mountain glaciers during the last 100
years in response to widespread increases in temperature. There
has been especially fast glacial recession in the tropics in recent
decades, although tropical temperatures in the free atmosphere
near glacier levels have increased little since 1980 according to
radiosonde and MSU data.

Palaeoclimate proxy indicators have the potential to provide

Typically, the interpretation of a proxy climate record is compli-

"Analyses of overall temperature trends in the low to mid-
troposphere and near the surface since 1958 are in good
agreement, with a warming of about 0.1°C per decade. Since the
beginning of the satellite record (1979), however, low to mid-
troposphere temperatures have warmed in both satellite and
weather balloon records at a global rate of only 0.04 and
0.03°C/decade respectively. This is about 0.12°C/decade less
than the rate of temperature increase near the surface since 1979.
About half of this difference in warming rate is very likely to be
due to the combination of differences in spatial coverage and the
real physical affects of volcanoes and ENSO (Santer et al., 2000),
see also Chapter 12. The remaining difference remains
unexplained, but is likely to be real. In the stratosphere, both
satellites and weather balloons continue to show substantial
cooling. The faster rate of recession of tropical mountain glaciers
in the last twenty years than might have been expected from the

glaciers may still be responding to the warming indicated by

"Since the SAR, a number of studies based on considerably
expanded databases of palaeoclimate information have allowed
more decisive conclusions about the spatial and temporal patterns
of climate change in past centuries. A number of important
advances have been in key areas such as ice core palaeoclima-

based on global networks of “multi-proxy” data have proved
particularly useful for describing global or hemispheric patterns
of climate variability in past centuries (e.g., Bradley and Jones,

Overpeck et al., 1997; Mann et al., 1998, 1999). Such estimates
allow the observed trends of the 20th century to be put in a
longer-term perspective. These have also allowed better compar-

"To determine whether 20th century warming is unusual, it is
essential to place it in the context of longer-term climate
variability. Owing to the sparseness of instrumental climate
records prior to the 20th century (especially prior to the mid-19th
century), estimates of global climate variability during past
centuries must often rely upon indirect “proxy” indicators —
natural or human documentary archives that record past climate
variations, but must be calibrated against instrumental data for a
meaningful climate interpretation (Bradley, 1999, gives a
review). Coarsely resolved climate trends over several centuries
are evident in many regions e.g., from the recession of glaciers
(Grove and Switsur, 1994; and Section 2.2.5.4) or the geothermal
information provided by borehole measurements (Pollack et al.,
1998). Large-scale estimates of decadal, annual or seasonal
climate variations in past centuries, however, must rely upon
sources that resolve annual or seasonal climatic variations. Such
proxy information includes width and density measurements
from tree rings (e.g., Cook, 1995; see Fritts, 1991, for a review),
layer thickness from laminated sediment cores (e.g., Hughen er
al., 1996; Lamoureux and Bradley, 1996), isotopes, chemistry,
and accumulation from annually resolved ice cores (e.g.,
Claussen et al., 1995; Fisher et al., 1998), isotopes from corals
(e.g., Tudhope er al., 1995; Dunbar and Cole, 1999), and the
sparse historical documentary evidence available over the globe
during the past few centuries (see e.g., Bradley and Jones, 1995;
Pfister et al., 1998). Taken as a whole, such proxy climate data
can provide global scale sampling of climate variations several
centuries into the past, with the potential to resolve large-scale
patterns of climate change prior to the instrumental period, albeit
with important limitations and uncertainties.

The best dated series are based on sub-annual sampling of
cores and the counting of seasonal ice layers. Such series may
have absolute dating errors as small as a few years in a millennium
(Fisher et al., 1996). Dating is sometimes performed using
volcanic acid layers with assumed dates (e.g., Clausen er al.,

"Palaeoclimate reconstructions from corals provide insights into
the past variability of the tropical and sub-tropical oceans and
atmosphere, prior to the instrumental period, at annual or seasonal
resolutions, making them a key addition to terrestrial information.
Because of their potential to sample climate variations in ENSO-
sensitive regions, a modest network of high-quality coral site
records can resolve key large-scale patterns of climate variability
(Evans et al., 1998). The corals used for palaeoclimate reconstruc-
tion grow throughout the tropics in relatively shallow waters, often
living for several centuries. Accurate annual age estimates are
possible for most sites using a combination of annual variations in
skeletal density and geochemical parameters. Palaeoclimate
reconstructions from corals generally rely on geochemical charac-
teristics of the coral skeleton such as temporal variations in trace
elements or stable isotopes or, less frequently, on density or
variations in fluorescence. Dunbar and Cole (1999) review the use
of coral records for palaeoclimatic reconstruction.

Recently, there has been increased activity in creating high-
resolution Antarctic ice core series e.g., for the past millennium
(Peel et al., 1996; Mayewski and Goodwin, 1997; Morgan and
van Ommen, 1997). In certain regions, isotope information from
ice cores shows the late 20th century temperatures as the warmest
few decades in the last 1,000 years (Thompson et al., 2000a). Key
strengths of ice core information are their high resolution (annual
or even seasonal where accumulations rates are particularly high
— see van Ommen and Morgan, 1996, 1997), availability in polar
and high-elevation regions where other types of proxy climate
information like tree-ring data are not available, and their
provision of multiple climate- and atmosphere-related variables
from the same reasonably well dated physical location (e.g., the
GISP2 core; White et al., 1998a). A weakness of ice core data is
regional sampling bias (high elevation or high latitude) and melt
water and precipitation accumulation data are not easy to date
accurately.

"Tree-ring records of past climate are precisely dated, annually
resolved, and can be well calibrated and verified (Fritts, 1976).
They typically extend from the present to several centuries or
more into the past, and so are useful for documenting climate
change in terrestrial regions of the globe. Many recent studies
have sought to reconstruct warm-season and annual temperatures
several centuries or more ago from either the width or the density
of annual growth rings (Briffa et al., 1995; D’ Arrigo et al., 1996;
Jacoby et al., 1996; D’ Arrigo et al., 1998; Wiles et al., 1998;
Hughes et al., 1999; Cook et al., 2000). Recently, there has been
a concerted effort to develop spatial reconstructions of past
temperature variations (e.g., Briffa et al., 1996) and estimates of
hemispheric and global temperature change (e.g., Briffa ef al.,
1998b; Briffa, 2000). Tree-ring networks are also now being used
to reconstruct important indices of climate variability over several
centuries such as the Southern Oscillation Index (Stahle et al.,
1998), the North Atlantic Oscillation (Cook et al., 1998; Cullen et
al., 2001) and the Antarctic Oscillation Index (Villalba er al.,
1997) (see also Section 2.6), as well as patterns of pre-instru-
mental precipitation and d drought (Section 2.5.2.2).

Several important caveats must be borne in mind when using
tree-ring data for palaeoclimate reconstructions. Not least is the
intrinsic sampling bias. Tree-ring information is available only in
terrestrial regions, so is not available over substantial regions of
the globe, and the climate signals contained in tree-ring density or
width data reflect a complex biological response to climate
forcing. Non-climatic growth trends must be removed from the
tree-ring chronology, making it difficult to resolve time-scales
longer than the lengths of the constituent chronologies (Briffa,
2000). Furthermore, the biological response to climate forcing
may change over time. There is evidence, for example, that high
latitude tree-ring density variations have changed in their response
to temperature in recent decades, associated with possible non-
climatic factors (Briffa et al., 1998a). By contrast, Vaganov et al.
(1999) have presented evidence that such changes may actually be
climatic and result from the effects of increasing winter precipita-
tion on the starting date of the growing season (see Section
2.7.2.2). Carbon dioxide fertilization may also have an influence,
particularly on high-elevation drought-sensitive tree species,
although attempts have been made to correct for this effect where
appropriate (Mann et al., 1999). Thus climate reconstructions
based entirely on tree-ring data are susceptible to several sources
of contamination or non-stationarity of response. For these
reasons, investigators have increasingly found tree-ring data most

"Annually laminated (varved) lake sediments offer considerable
potential as high-resolution archives of palaeo-environmental

available (e.g., arid terrestrial regions), and latitudes poleward of
the treeline (Lamoureux and Bradley, 1996; Wohlfarth er al.,
1998; Hughen et al., 2000). When annual deposition of the varves
can be independently confirmed (e.g., through radiometric
dating), they provide seasonal to interannual resolution over
centuries to millennia. Varved sediments can be formed from
biological processes or from the deposition of inorganic
sediments, both of which are often influenced by climate
variations. Three primary climate variables may influence lake
varves: (a) summer temperature, serving as an index of the
energy available to melt the seasonal snowpack, or snow and ice
on glaciers; (b) winter snowfall, which governs the volume of
discharge capable of mobilising sediments when melting; and (c)
rainfall. Laminated lake sediments dominated by (a) can be used
for inferences about past high latitude summer temperature
changes (e.g., Overpeck et al., 1997), while sediments dominated
by the latter two influences can be used to estimate past drought
and precipitation patterns (Section 2.5.2.2).

"While borehole data provide a direct estimate of ground
surface temperatures under certain simplifying assumptions
about the geothermal properties of the earth near the borehole, a
number of factors complicate their interpretation. Non-tempera-
ture-related factors such as land-use changes, natural land cover
variations, long-term variations in winter snow cover and soil
moisture change the sub-surface thermal properties and weaken
the interpretation of the reconstructions as estimates of surface air
temperature change. In central England, where seasonal snow
cover is not significant, and major land-use changes occurred
many centuries ago, borehole ground surface temperature trends
do tend to be similar to those in long instrumental records (Jones,
1999). In contrast, Skinner and Majorowicz (1999) show that
borehole estimates of ground surface temperature warming
during the 20th century in north-western North America are | to
2°C greater than in corresponding instrumental estimates of
surface air temperature. They suggest that this discrepancy may
be due to land-use changes that can enhance warming of the
ground surface relative to that of the overlying atmospheric
boundary layer (see also Lewis, 1998). Such factors need to be
better understood before borehole temperature measurements can
be confidently interpreted.

"The position of moraines or till left behind by receding glaciers
can provide information on the advances (and, less accurately, the
retreats) of mountain glaciers. Owing to the complex balance
between local changes in melting and ice accumulation, and the
effects of topography which influence mountain glaciers (see
Section 2.2.5.4), it is difficult to reconstruct regional (as opposed
to global) climate changes from the extent of mountain glaciers
alone (Oerlemans, 1989). For example, both increased winter
precipitation (through greater accumulation) and lower summer
temperatures (through decreased melting or “‘ablation’”’) can lead
to more positive glacial mass balances. The inertia of large
glaciers dictates that they respond to climate change relatively
slowly, with delays of decades or occasionally centuries. For
smaller, fast moving glaciers in regions where precipitation and
accumulation are moderate, temperature changes are usually the
dominant factor influencing mountain glacier masses and
lengths. Here glacier moraine evidence in combination with other
lines of evidence can provide reliable information on past
regional temperature changes (Salinger, 1995; Holzhauser and

independent (extra-tropical, warm-season) Northern Hemisphere
temperature estimate by Briffa (2000) based on tree-ring density

smoothed Mann er al. series. Significant differences between the
three reconstructions are evident during the 17th and early 19th
centuries where either the Briffa et al. or Jones et al. series lie
outside the estimated uncertainties in the Mann ef al. series.
Much of these differences appear to result from the different
latitudinal and seasonal emphases of the temperature estimates.
This conclusion is supported by the observation that the Mann et
al. hemispheric temperature average, when restricted to just the
extra-tropical (30 to 70°N band) region of the Northern
Hemisphere, shows greater similarity in its trend over the past
few centuries to the Jones ef al. reconstruction. The differences
between these reconstructions emphasise the importance of
regional and seasonal variations in climate change. These are

"Historical documentary data are valuable sources of
information about past climate (e.g., Brown and Issar, 1998;
Bradley, 1999). However, their use requires great care, as such
documents may be biased towards describing only the more
extreme events, and are, in certain cases, prone to the use of
inconsistent language between different writers and different
epochs, and to errors in dating. As for all proxy information,
historical documents require careful calibration and verification
against modern instrumental data. Two areas particularly strong
in historical documents describing climate are Europe and China.
In Europe, attempts have been made to extend long climate series
back in time using a combination of documentary evidence and
fragmentary instrumental records (e.g., Pfister, 1995; Pfister et

also been obtained purely from documentary records in Europe

of annual surface temperature several centuries back in time. They
calibrated a combined terrestrial (tree ring, ice core and historical
documentary indicator) and marine (coral) multi-proxy climate
network against dominant patterns of 20th century global surface
temperature. Averaging the reconstructed temperature patterns
over the far more data-rich Northern Hemisphere half of the
global domain, they estimated the Northern Hemisphere mean
temperature back to AD 1400, a reconstruction which had signif-
icant skill in independent cross-validation tests. Self-consistent
estimates were also made of the uncertainties. This work has now
been extended back to AD 1000 (Figure 2.20, based on Mann et
al., 1999). The uncertainties (the shaded region in Figure 2.20)
expand considerably in earlier centuries because of the sparse
network of proxy data. Taking into account these substantial
uncertainties, Mann er al. (1999) concluded that the 1990s were
likely to have been the warmest decade, and 1998 the warmest
year, of the past millennium for at least the Northern Hemisphere.
Jones et al. (1998) came to a similar conclusion from largely
independent data and an entirely independent methodology.
Crowley and Lowery (2000) reached the similar conclusion that
medieval temperatures were no warmer than mid-20th century
temperatures. Borehole data (Pollack er al., 1998) independently
support this conclusion for the past 500 years although, as
discussed earlier (Section 2.3.2.1), detailed interpretations
comparison with long-term trends from such of such data are
perilous owing to loss of temporal resolution back in time.

The evidence for temperature changes in past centuries in
the Southern Hemisphere is quite sparse. What evidence is
available at the hemispheric scale for summer (Jones et al., 1998)
and annual mean conditions (Mann er al., 2000b) suggests
markedly different behaviour from the Northern Hemisphere.
The only obvious similarity is the unprecedented warmth of the
late 20th century. Speleothem evidence (isotopic evidence from
calcite deposition in stalagmites and stalactites) from South
Africa indicates anomalously cold conditions only prior to the
19th century, while speleothem (records derived from analysing
stalagmites and stalagtites) and glacier evidence from the
Southern Alps of New Zealand suggests cold conditions during
the mid-17th and mid-19th centuries (Salinger, 1995).
Dendroclimatic evidence from nearby Tasmania (Cook er al.,

Evidence from mountain glaciers does suggest increased glacia-
tion in a number of widely spread regions outside Europe prior to
the 20th century, including Alaska, New Zealand and Patagonia
(Grove and Switsur, 1994). However, the timing of maximum
glacial advances in these regions differs considerably, suggesting
that they may represent largely independent regional climate
changes, not a globally-synchronous increased glaciation (see
Bradley, 1999). Thus current evidence does not support globally
synchronous periods of anomalous cold or warmth over this
timeframe, and the conventional terms of “Little Ice Age” and
“Medieval Warm Period” appear to have limited utility in
describing trends in hemispheric or global mean temperature
changes in past centuries. With the more widespread proxy data
and multi-proxy reconstructions of temperature change now
available, the spatial and temporal character of these putative

climate epochs can be reassessed.

"Mann et al. (1998) and Jones et al. (1998) support the idea
that the 15th to 19th centuries were the coldest of the millennium
over the Northern Hemisphere overall. However, viewed
hemispherically, the “Little Ice Age” can only be considered as a
modest cooling of the Northern Hemisphere during this period of
less than 1°C relative to late 20th century levels (Bradley and
Jones, 1993; Jones et al., 1998; Mann et al., 1998; 1999; Crowley
and Lowery, 2000). Cold conditions appear, however, to have been
considerably more pronounced in particular regions. Such regional
variability can be understood in part as reflecting accompanying
changes in atmospheric circulation. The “Little Ice Age” appears
to have been most clearly expressed in the North Atlantic region as
altered patterns of atmospheric circulation (O’Brien et al., 1995).
Unusually cold, dry winters in central Europe (e.g., 1 to 2°C below
normal during the late 17th century) were very likely to have been
associated with more frequent flows of continental air from the
north-east (Wanner et al., 1995; Pfister, 1999). Such conditions are
consistent (Luterbacher et al., 1999) with the negative or enhanced
easterly wind phase of the NAO (Sections 2.2.2.3 and 2.6.5),
which implies both warm and cold anomalies over different
regions in the North Atlantic sector. Such strong influences on
European temperature demonstrate the difficulty in extrapolating
the sparse early information about European climate change to the
hemispheric, let alone global, scale. While past changes in the
NAO have likely had an influence in eastern North America,
changes in the El Nifio phenomenon (see also Section 2.6), are
likely to have had a particularly significant influence on regional
temperature patterns over North America.

scale than is typically inferred for the conventionally-defined
European epoch. The Northern Hemisphere mean temperature
estimates of Jones et al. (1998), Mann et al. (1999), and Crowley
and Lowery (2000) show temperatures from the 11th to 14th
centuries to be about 0.2°C warmer than those from the 15th to
19th centuries, but rather below mid-20th century temperatures.
The long-term hemispheric trend is best described as a modest
and irregular cooling from AD 1000 to around 1850 to 1900,
followed by an abrupt 20th century warming. Regional evidence
is, however, quite variable. Crowley and Lowery (2000) show
that western Greenland exhibited anomalous warmth locally only
around AD 1000 (and to a lesser extent, around AD 1400), with
quite cold conditions during the latter part of the 11th century,
while Scandinavian summer temperatures appeared relatively
warm only during the 11th and early 12th centuries. Crowley and
Lowery (2000) find no evidence for warmth in the tropics.
Regional evidence for medieval warmth elsewhere in the
Northern Hemisphere is so variable that eastern, yet not western,
China appears to have been warm by 20th century standards from
the 9th to 13th centuries. The 12th and 14th centuries appear to
have been mainly cold in China (Wang ef al., 1998a,b; Wang and
Gong, 2000). The restricted evidence from the Southern
Hemisphere, e.g., the Tasmanian tree-ring temperature
reconstruction of Cook et al. (1999), shows no evidence for a
distinct Medieval Warm Period.

"Only during the 1980s was the possibility of rapid climatic
changes occurring at the time-scale of human life more or less
fully recognised, largely due to the Greenland ice core drilled at
Dye 3 in Southern Greenland (Dansgaard et al., 1982, 1989). A
possible link between such events and the mode of operation of the
ocean was then subsequently suggested (Oeschger er al., 1984;
Broecker ef al., 1985; see Broecker, 1997, for a recent review).
The SAR reviewed the evidence of such changes since the peak of
the last inter-glacial period about 120 ky BP (thousands of years
Before Present). It concluded that: (1) large and rapid climatic
changes occurred during the last Ice Age and during the transition
towards the present Holocene; (2) temperatures were far less
variable during this latter period; and (3) suggestions that rapid
changes may have also occurred during the last inter-glacial
required confirmation.

"Since the SAR there have been considerable advances in our
knowledge of temperature change over the last millennium. It is
likely that temperatures were relatively warm in the Northern
Hemisphere as a whole during the earlier centuries of the millen-
nium, but it is much less likely that a globally-synchronous, well
defined interval of “Medieval warmth” existed, comparable to the
near global warmth of the late 20th century. Marked warmth
seems to have been confined to Europe and regions neighbouring
the North Atlantic. Relatively colder hemispheric or global-scale
conditions did appear to set in after about AD 1400 and persist
through the 19th century, but peak coldness is observed during
substantially different epochs in different regions. By contrast, the
warming of the 20th century has had a much more convincing
global signature (see Figure 2.9). This is consistent with the
palaeoclimate evidence that the rate and magnitude of global or
hemispheric surface 20th century warming is likely to have been

"These changes are now best documented from ice core,
deep-sea sediment and continental records. Complementary and
generally discontinuous information comes from coral and lake
level data. The time-scale for the Pleistocene deep-sea core
record is based on the orbitally tuned oxygen isotope record
from marine sediments (Martinson ef al., 1987), constrained by
two radiometrically dated horizons, the peak of the last inter-
glacial (about 124 ky BP) and the Brunhes/Matuyama reversal
of the Earth’s magnetic field at about 780 ky BP. '4C-dating is
also used in the upper 50 ky BP; the result is a deep-sea core
chronology believed to be accurate to within a few per cent for
the last million years. '4C-dating is also used for dating
continental records as well as the counting of annual layers in
tree rings and varved lake records, whereas ice-core chron-
ologies are obtained by combining layer counting, glaciological
models and comparison with other dated records. The use of
globally representative records, such as changes in continental
ice volume recorded in the isotopic composition of deep-sea
sediments, or changes in atmospheric composition recorded in
air bubbles trapped in ice cores, now allow such local records to
be put into a global perspective. Studies still largely focus on the
more recent glacial-interglacial cycle (the last 120 to 130 ky).

"Recent studies comparing reconstructions of surface tempera-

Robock, 1999; Waple et al., 2001) suggest that a combination of
solar and volcanic influences have affected large-scale tempera-
ture in past centuries. The primary features of the Northern
Hemisphere mean annual temperature histories of Mann et al.
(1999a) and Crowley and Lowery (2000) from AD 1000 to 1900
have been largely reproduced based on experiments using an
Energy Balance Model forced by estimates of these natural
radiative forcings (Crowley, 2000; Mann, 2000) making the
argument that the “Little Ice Age” and “Medieval Warm Period”,
at the hemispheric mean scale, are consistent with estimates of
naturally-forced climate variability. Several studies indicate that
the combined effect of these influences has contributed a small
component to the warming of the 20th century. Most of these
studies isolate greenhouse radiative forcing as being dominant
during late 20th century warming (see Crowley, 2000). This
argues against a close empirical relationship between certain
sun-climate parameters and large-scale temperature that has
been claimed for the 20th century (Hoyt and Schatten, 1997).
The reader is referred to Chapter 6 for a detailed discussion of
these radiative forcings, and to Chapter 12 for comparisons of

We also now have a better knowledge of climate variability
over the last few climatic cycles as illustrated by selected palaeo-
temperature records back to about 400 ky (Figure 2.23). The
amplitude of the glacial-interglacial temperature change was lower
in tropical and equatorial regions (e.g., curve c) than in mid- and
high latitudes (other curves). During glacial periods, the climate of
the North Atlantic and adjacent regions (curves a and b) was more
variable than in the Southern Hemisphere (curve d). Also (not
shown), full glacial periods were characterised by very high fluxes
of dust (seen in ice-core records and in continental and marine
records). A combination of increased dust source area, stronger
atmospheric transport and a weaker hydrological cycle (Yung et

"core in central East Antarctica. The strong relationship between
CO, and CH, and Antarctic climate documented over the last
climatic cycle has been remarkably confirmed over four climatic
cycles, spanning about 420 ky (Figure 2.22). Present day levels of
these two important greenhouse gases appear unprecedented
during this entire interval (Petit et al., 1999; and Figure 2.22). From
a detailed study of the last three glacial terminations in the Vostok
ice core, Fischer et al. (1999) conclude that CO, increases started
600 + 400 years after the Antarctic warming. However, considering
the large uncertainty in the ages of the CO, and ice (1,000 years or
more if we consider the ice accumulation rate uncertainty), Petit et
al. (1999) felt it premature to ascertain the sign of the phase
relationship between CO), and Antarctic temperature at the initia-
tion of the terminations. In any event, CO, changes parallel
Antarctic temperature changes during deglaciations (Sowers and
Bender, 1995; Blunier et al., 1997; Petit et al., 1999). This is
consistent with a significant contribution of these greenhouse gases
to the glacial-interglacial changes by amplifying the initial orbital
forcing (Petit et al., 1999).

a greatly expanded monsoon in the early and mid-Holocene,

thereafter. In New Zealand the warmest conditions occurred
between about 10 to 8 ky BP, when there was a more complete
forest cover than at any other time. Glacial activity was at a

Central Greenland ice cores and European lake isotopic
records show correlated temperature variations within the
Holocene, with a roughly 50% higher amplitude at Summit
Greenland, compared to Europe (Figure 2.24). The most
prominent event in both records occurred about 8,200 years BP
(Alley et al., 1997; von Grafenstein et al., 1998; Barber ef al.,
1999) when annual mean temperatures dropped by as much as
2°C in mid-Europe and the European alpine timberline fell by
about 200 m (Wick and Tinner, 1999). The event may be related
to a significant decrease of SST in the Norwegian Sea (Klitgaard-
Kristensen et al., 1998). Lake records from the southern border
of the Sahara indicate extremely dry conditions during this time,
and probably also during other cool but less dramatic events of
this kind (Street-Perrot and Perrot, 1990 ; Gasse and Van Campo,
1994). The about 8,200 year cooling may also have been
worldwide (Stager and Mayewski, 1997), although abrupt early
Holocene climate changes recorded in a North American lake are
thought to reflect a different event (Hu et al., 1999). Thus cooling
is indicated in the New Zealand Southern Alps, with small
advances of the mountain glaciers at about 8,000 years BP
(Salinger and McGlone, 1989).

The rate of temperature change during the recovery phase
from the last glacial maximum provides a benchmark against
which to assess warming rates in the late 20th century. Available
data indicate an average warming rate of about 2°C/millennium
between about 20 and 10 ky BP in Greenland, with lower rates
for other regions. Speleothem data from New Zealand, and
positions of mountain glacier moraine termini suggest warming
rates of 2°C/millennium from 15 to 13 ky BP (Salinger and
McGlone, 1989). Speleothem data for South Africa suggest a
warming rate of 1.5°C/millennium (Partridge, 1997) over the
same time period. On the other hand, very rapid warming at the
start of the Bolling-Alleréd period, or at the end of the Younger
Dryas may have occurred at rates as large as 10°C/S0 years for a
significant part of the Northern Hemisphere.

"The central Greenland ice core record (GRIP and GISP2) has
a near annual resolution across the entire glacial to Holocene
transition, and reveals episodes of very rapid change. The return
to the cold conditions of the Younger Dryas from the incipient
inter-glacial warming 13,000 years ago took place within a few
decades or less (Alley et al., 1993). The warming phase, that took
place about 11,500 years ago, at the end of the Younger Dryas was
also very abrupt and central Greenland temperatures increased by
7°C or more in a few decades (Johnsen et al., 1992; Grootes et al.,
1993; Severinghaus ef al., 1998). Most of the changes in wind-
blown materials and some other climate indicators were
accomplished in a few years (Alley et al., 1993; Taylor et al.,
1993; Hammer et al., 1997). Broad regions of the Earth experi-
enced almost synchronous changes over periods of 0 to 30 years
(Severinghaus ef al., 1998), and changes were very abrupt in at
least some regions (Bard er al., 1987), e.g. requiring as little as 10
years off Venezuela (Hughen ef al., 1996). Fluctuations in ice
conductivity indicate that atmospheric circulation was reorgan-
ised extremely rapidly (Taylor et al., 1993). A similar, correlated
sequence of abrupt deglacial events also occurred in the tropical
and temperate North Atlantic (Bard et al., 1987; Hughen er al.,
1996) and in Western Europe (von Grafenstein et al., 1999).

Oxygen isotope measurements in Greenland ice cores
demonstrate that a series of rapid warm and cold oscillations
called Dansgaard-Oeschger events punctuated the last glaciation
(Figure 2.23, see North Atlantic SST panel, and Dansgaard et al.,
1993). Associated temperature changes may be as high as 16°C
(Lang et al., 1999). These oscillations are correlated with SST
variations in several North Atlantic deep-sea cores (Bond et al.,
1993). There was clearly a close relation between these ice core
temperature cycles and another prominent feature of North
Atlantic deep-sea core records, the Heinrich events. Heinrich
events occurred every 7,000 to 10,000 years during times of sea
surface cooling in the form of brief, exceptionally large,
discharges of icebergs from the Laurentide and European ice
sheets which left conspicuous layers of detrital rocks in deep-sea
sediments. Accompanying the Heinrich events were large
decreases in the oxygen isotope ratio of planktonic foraminifera,
providing evidence of lowered surface salinity probably caused
by melting of drifting ice (Bond ef al., 1993). Heinrich events
appear at the end of a series of saw-toothed shaped, near millen-
nial temperature cycles. Each set of millennial cycles is known as
a Bond cycle. Each cycle was characterised by a succession of
progressively cooler relatively warm periods (interstadials)
during the Ice Age period. Each cooling trend ended with a very

Deep-sea cores also show the presence of ice rafting cycles
in the intervals between Heinrich events (Bond and Lotti, 1995).
Their duration varies between 2,000 and 3,000 years and they
closely coincide with the Dansgaard-Oeschger events of the last
glaciation. A study of the ice-rafted material suggests that, coinci-
dent with the Dansgaard-Oeschger cooling, ice within the
Icelandic ice cap and within or near the Gulf of Saint Lawrence
underwent nearly synchronous increases in rates of calving. The
Heinrich events reflect a slower rhythm of iceberg discharges,
probably from the Hudson Strait.

modes of operation. These are: deep-water sinking in the GIN

deep-water sinking in the North Atlantic or in the Labrador Sea

These rapid climatic events of the last glacial period, best
documented in Greenland and the North Atlantic, have smoothed
counterparts in Antarctica (Bender er al., 1994; Jouzel et al.,
1994). A peak in the concentration of the isotope beryllium-10 in
ice cores (Yiou et al., 1997a), changes in the concentration of
atmospheric methane (Blunier et al., 1998) and in the isotopic
content of oxygen in ice cores (Bender et al., 1999) indicate links
between the Northern and Southern Hemisphere climates over
this period. Large Greenland warming events around 36 and 45
ky BP lag their Antarctic counterparts by more than 1,000 years.
This argues against coupling between northern and southern
polar regions via the atmosphere but favours a connection via the
ocean (Blunier et al., 1998).

"Air temperature, SST and salinity variations in the North
Atlantic are associated with major changes in the thermohaline
circulation. A core from the margin of the Faeroe-Shetland
channel covering the last glacial period reveals numerous oscilla-
tions in benthic and planktonic foraminifera, oxygen isotopes and
ice-rafted detritus (Rasmussen et al., 1996a). These oscillations
correlate with the Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles, showing a close
relationship between the deep ocean circulation and the abrupt
climatic changes of the last glaciation. Warm episodes were
associated with higher SST and the presence of oceanic convec-
tion in the Norwegian Greenland Sea. Cold episodes were associ-
ated with low SST and salinity and no convection in the
Norwegian Greenland Sea (Rasmussen et al., 1996b). Cores from
the mid-latitudes of the North Atlantic show that the iceberg
discharges in Heinrich events resulted in both low salinity and a
reduced thermohaline circulation (Cortijo et al., 1997; Vidal et

transport that supplies the water for the formation of the Labrador

the North Atlantic and Labrador Sea deep-water formation allows
this heat to remain in the South Atlantic (Crowley, 1992), and
may increase deep-water formation either south of the area
affected by melt-water injection (Vidal et al., 1997, 1998) or in
the Southern Ocean (Broecker, 1998). This reorganisation could
cause warming of regions of the South Atlantic and downwind of

The study of atmospheric composition changes has revealed
that rapid changes of properties observed for the lowest part of
the Greenland cores (GRIP Project Members, 1993; Grootes et
al., 1993) do not correspond to climatic instabilities during the
last inter-glacial (Chappellaz et al., 1997). The extent to which
climate was more or less stable during this last inter-glacial than
during the Holocene is unclear. Early evidence from marine cores
(CLIMAP, 1984; McManus er al., 1994) and other ice cores
(Jouzel et al., 1993) indicated that the Eemian climate was rather
stable. A high resolution North Atlantic record shows a lack of
substantial fluctuations during the last inter-glacial but also
indicates that the Eemian began and ended with abrupt changes
in deep-water flow, with transitions occurring in less than 400
years (Adkins et al., 1997). In New Zealand, there were at least
three periods of milder climate than typical of the Holocene
during the last inter-glacial (Salinger and McGlone, 1989). Study
of an Indonesian fossil coral indicates that ENSO was robust
during the last glacial period (Hughen et al., 1999).

Knight, 1998; Doherty et al., 1999). Dai et al. (1997b) found a
global secular increase in precipitation separate from ENSO and
other modes of variability. Data from over 20,000 stations
contributed to the changes since 1900 shown in Figure 2.25. The

Precipitation measurement and analysis are made more
difficult by accompanying natural phenomena such as wind and
the use of different instruments and techniques (Arkin and
Ardanuy, 1989). Because of the substantial under-catch of
precipitation gauges during solid precipitation, frequent light
rainfall events, or windy conditions, the true precipitation in the
Arctic is more than 50% higher than the measured values
(Ferland and Hanssen-Bauer, 2000). Gauge under-catch is
substantially less in warmer, less windy climates with heavier
rainfall. New, satellite-derived precipitation estimates offer the
prospect of near-global climatologies covering at least one or two
decades, but multi-decadal global changes cannot be estimated
with high confidence.

"Over the 20th century, annual zonally averaged precipitation
increased by between 7 to 12% for the zones 30°N to 85°N and by
about 2% between 0°S to 55°S (Figure 2.25(ii)). The increase in
the Northern Hemisphere is likely to be slightly biased because
adjustments have not been made for the increasing fraction of
precipitation falling in liquid as opposed to frozen form. The exact
rate of precipitation increase depends on the method of calculating
the changes, but the bias is expected to be small because the
amount of annual precipitation affected by this trend is generally
only about a few per cent. Nevertheless, this unsteady, but highly
statistically significant trend toward more precipitation in many of
these regions is continuing. For example, in 1998 the Northern
Hemisphere high latitudes (55°N and higher) had their wettest year

"Current evidence indicates that very rapid and large temperature
changes, generally associated with changes in oceanic and
atmospheric circulation, occurred during the last glacial period
and during the last deglaciation, particularly in higher latitudes of
the Northern Hemisphere. During the warming phases, and the
Younger Dryas pause, there is evidence of almost worldwide,
nearly synchronous events. However, as with the Holocene
maximum warming and the Last Glacial Maximum, these
changes appear to have occurred asynchronously between the
Northern Hemisphere and at least part of the Southern
Hemisphere. During the Holocene smaller but locally quite large
climate changes occurred sporadically; similar changes may have
occurred in the last inter-glacial. Evidence is increasing,
therefore, that a rapid reorganisation of atmospheric and ocean
circulation (time-scales of several decades or more) can occur
during inter-glacial periods without human interference.

Figure 2.25(i) shows mostly ir increasing precipitation in the
Northern Hemisphere mid- and high latitudes, especially during
the autumn and winter, but these increases vary both spatially and
temporally. For example, precipitation over the United States has
increased by between 5 to 10% since 1900 (Figure 2.25(ii)) but this
increase has been interrupted by multi-year anomalies such as the
drought years of the 1930s and early 1950s (Karl and Knight,
1998; Groisman ef al., 1999). The increase is most pronounced
during the warm seasons. Using data selected to be relatively free
of anthropogenic influences such as ground water pumpage or land
use changes, several recent analyses (Lettenmaier ef al., 1999; Lins
and Slack, 1999; Groisman er al., 2001) have detected increases in
streamflow across much of the contiguous United States,
confirming the general tendency to increasing precipitation.
However, Lins and Michaels (1994) found in some regions that
increased streamflow did not relate well to an increase in rainfall.
This has been further evaluated by Groisman et al. (2001) who
show that changes in snow-cover extent also influence the timing
and volume of streamflow.

Based on recent research (Bogdanova and Mescherskaya,
1998; Groisman and Rankova, 2001), the precipitation trend for the
last century over the former USSR as reported by the SAR was
slightly overestimated. The new results indicate that precipitation
has increased since 1891 by about 5% west of 90°E for both warm
and cold seasons. Georgievsky et al. (1996) also noted increases in
precipitation over the last several decades over western Russia,
accompanied by increases in streamflow and a rise in the level of
the Caspian Sea. In eastern Russia a negative precipitation trend
since 1945 is embedded in the century-long positive precipitation
trend (Figure 2.25(ii); Gruza et al., 1999). Soil moisture data for
large regions of Eurasia (Robock et al., 2000) show large upward
trends. The rate of increase is more than | cm/decade in the
available soil moisture in the top | m of soil. These large positive
trends occur simultaneously with positive trends in temperature
that would normally reduce soil moisture. Increases in precipita-
tion (and cloud cover, Section 2.5.5) are believed to have more than

compensated for the increased losses due to evapotranspiration.

the Dunde Ice Cap on the Tibetan Plateau (Thompson, 1996)
was slower in the first half of the last millennium than the last
500 years, but 500-year averages are not easily related to the
palaeo-temperature data (Figure 2.21). Pollen evidence
indicates significant changes in summer rainfall patterns in
China in the earlier centuries of the past millennium (Ren,
1998). The relationship between such past changes in regional
drought and precipitation patterns, and _ large-scale
atmospheric circulation patterns associated with ENSO, for
example, is an area of active current research (e.g., Cole and
Cook, 1998).

"The strong spatial variability inherent in precipitation requires
the use of estimates based on satellite observations for many
regions. Thus satellite data are essential to infer global
changes in precipitation, as the oceans account for 70% of the
global surface area. Since adequate observations were not
made until the early 1970s, no satellite-based record is
sufficiently long to permit estimates of century-long changes.
The first satellite instrument specifically designed to make
estimates of precipitation did not begin operation until 1987.
At this time three data sets are available: (a) the Global
Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) product, which
spans the period from 1987 to the present (Huffman ef al.,
1997); (b) the CPC Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP)
product, covering the period from 1979 to 1998 (Xie and
Arkin, 1997); and (c) MSU-derived precipitation estimates
since 1979 (Spencer, 1993). While the period from 1987
appears to be well observed, it is too short to draw conclusions
regarding decadal-scale variations. The longer CMAP data set
assumes that the various satellite-derived estimates have no
trend over the period, and hence no longer time-scale conclu-
sions are possible. Nonetheless, analyses of the CMAP
product and associated data from the NCEP reanalysis project
indicate that there have been substantial average increases in
precipitation over the tropical oceans during the last twenty
years, related to increased frequency and intensity of ENSO
(Trenberth et al., 2001). ENSO conditions are not related to
positive precipitation anomalies everywhere over the tropical
oceans (e.g., south-western Tropical Pacific).

Water vapour pressure, dew-point or relative humidity at the

thermometers are not usually aspirated, so that the cooling of the
wet bulb, and therefore the deduced specific or relative humidity,

Specific “humidity trends over the United States were
overwhelmingly positive for the period 1961 to 1995, with
magnitudes of several per cent per decade, and with the largest
and most statistically significant trends in spring and summer
(Gaffen and Ross, 1999). Night-time specific humidity trends
were generally stronger than daytime trends. Relative humidity
showed smaller increases, especially in winter and spring. The
specific humidity and derived dew point trends are broadly
consistent, both spatially and in their day-night differences, with
temperature trends. Schwartzman ef al. (1998) found that the
diurnal dewpoint cycle is changing over North America, with a
relative decline in late afternoon and a small rise at midday.

Furthermore, new analyses indicate upward trends in near-

upper tropospheric and lower stratospheric levels is of great
importance because strong alterations in radiative forcing can
result from small absolute changes in water vapour at these levels
(Chapters 6 and 7). New data presented here from the SPARC

Zhai and Eskridge (1997) 1 found increases of about 1 to
3%/decade in surface-to-200 hPa precipitable water over China
for 1970 to 1990. Increases were most significant in spring.
Percentage trends were larger over the 700 to 400 hPa layer than
the surface-700 hPa layer. Gutzler (1996) found that specific
humidity data at 1,000, 700, and 300 hPa at four western tropical
Pacific radiosonde stations from 1973 to 1993 gave increases of
3 to 9%/decade, with larger percentage increases at increasing
height above the surface. In contrast, Peixoto and Oort (1996)
found decreases in zonal mean relative humidity between 1974

they are more likely to be associated with instrument changes
than at lower levels, and are more pronounced at higher latitudes

quality of the data prevents any definitive conclusions about statis-
tical significance, nominal significance of trends at the 5% level
was estimated after smoothing the annual data to reduce the
influence of outliers at the beginning and end of this short series.
Few Southern Hemisphere data have been analysed, but Figure

Hemisphere. These increases are reflected in the individual
seasons, although nominally significant annual mean increases are
more extensive. Regional decreases over eastern Canada are
explained by colder conditions in the winter half year associated
with the increasingly positive phase of the North Atlantic

In summary, in situ and radiosonde measurements tend to
show increasing water vapour in the lower troposphere and near
the surface, though this is not seen everywhere, and data quality
is still an issue. The longer, more reliable data sets suggest multi-
decadal increases in atmospheric water vapour of several per cent
per decade over regions of the Northern Hemisphere. New
analyses of balloon and satellite records indicate that strato-
spheric water vapour above 18 km shows an increase of about
1%/year for the period 1981 to 2000 but with a slowing of the
positive trend after 1996. Satellite observations of upper-tropo-
spheric humidity from 1980 to 1997 show statistically significant
positive trends of 0.1%/year for the zone 10°N to 10°S.

some stratospheric instruments have sampled over a long enough
period that several overlapping time-series of intermediate length
(8 to 15 years) can be used to help evaluate stratospheric changes.
A reasonable degree of consistency was found among strato-

Accurate balloon observations of lower-stratospheric water
vapour are available from 1964 to 1976 over Washington, D.C.
and from 1980 to present over Boulder, Colorado, USA (e.g.,
Mastenbrook, 1968; Harries, 1976; Mastenbrook and Oltmans,
1983; Oltmans and Hofmann, 1995). The SPARC study shows
that these point measurements are nevertheless representative of
global stratospheric conditions above about 18 to 20 km, but not
of the lowest stratosphere where there can be significant regional
and seasonal changes. A positive lower stratosphere trend of
about | to 1.5%/year in specific humidity (about 0.04 ppm/year)
since the mid-1960s is indicated by the balloon data (Oltmans et
al., 2000). The increase was not monotonic but showed several
rapid rises with plateaux in between. Even though the recent
satellite record is relatively short, these measurements have
revealed changes of the same character. The satellite results show
a spatial pattern of trends in the lower stratosphere, and suggest a
slowing in the positive trend after 1996 (Smith er al., 2000).
Although not definitive, these observations are consistent in
suggesting that lower-stratospheric water vapour has increased
globally on average at about 1%/year over at least the past forty
years, but at a variable rate.

Although radiosondes have made observations of water
vapour in the upper troposphere (i.e., above 500 hPa) since the
1950s, these observations have suffered from instrumental errors
(Elliott and Gaffen, 1991). Peixoto and Oort (1996) have re-
examined these observations for the period 1974 to 1988 and
found large trends in upper-tropospheric humidity at the 300 hPa
level. They concluded that these trends were unrealistically large
and were likely to be due to instrument changes. Satellite
observations of upper-tropospheric humidity (UTH) measure-
ments made by TOVS (Television infrared observation satellite
Operational Vertical Sounder) since 1979, and representative of
a deep layer between 500 to 200 hPa, show very large interan-
nual variability (Bates et al., 1996). The SPARC assessment of
these observations (Kley et al., 2000) indicated that they were of
sufficient quality for trend analyses. The SPARC study and an
analysis by Bates and Jackson (2001) show large regional trends
that are attributed to circulation changes associated with ENSO,
decadal variability over equatorial Africa, and decadal
variability of the Arctic Oscillation (see Section 2.6).

"The SAR reported widespread decreases of pan evaporation over
the USA and Russia during the 20th century. Pan evaporation
measurements are an index of evaporation from a surface with an
unlimited supply of water (potential evaporation). Interpretation
of this result involving potential evaporation as a decrease in
actual land surface evaporation is contradictory to the temp-
erature and precipitation increase reported in these areas, and the
general intensification of the hydrological cycle over northern
extra-tropical land areas (Brutsaert and Parlange, 1998). Further
analysis by Lawrimore and Peterson (2000) supports Brutsaert
and Parlange’s (1998) interpretation, as does Golubev ef al.
(2001). Using parallel observations of actual evaporation and pan
evaporation at five Russian experimental sites, Golubev et al.
(2001) developed a method to estimate actual land surface
evaporation from the pan evaporation measurements. They
showed that using this method, actual evaporation is shown to
have increased during the second half of the 20th century over
most dry regions of the United States and Russia. Similarly, over
humid maritime regions of the eastern United States (and north-
eastern Washington state) actual evaporation during the warm
season was also found to increase. Only over the heavily forested
regions of Russia and the northern United States did actual
evaporation decrease. The increase in actual evaporation is
related to the greater availability of moisture at the surface, due
to increases in precipitation and the higher temperatures.

"this analysis showed a gradual rise in cumulonimbus cloud
amount from the mid-1950s to the mid-1970s, with a gradual

(1998b) cast doubt on the homogeneity of the cloud amounts
derived from ship data. They find that inter-decadal variations of
the frequency of occurrence of cloud amount for a given cloud
type are generally unrelated to similar time-scale variations in
SST and large-scale divergence of the surface winds.
Nonetheless, some regional changes and variations based on ship
reports of low and middle clouds are likely to be rather robust.
Variations in these categories of cloud are consistent with
variations of other climate system variables. Examples include:
(1) a long-term upward trend in altostratus and nimbostratus
across the mid-latitude North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans
(Parungo et al., 1994; Norris and Leovy, 1995); (2) ENSO related
variations in the frequency of low cloud types across the Pacific
and Indian Oceans (Bajuk and Leovy, 1998b); and (3) interannual
variations in summer season stratiform clouds across the North
Pacific (Norris et al., 1998). Norris (1999) found an increase in
total sky cover of approximately 2%, and an increase of approx-
imately 4% in low cloud cover in his analyses of ship reports
between 1952 and 1995. He finds no evidence for changes in
observation practices that may have affected these trends. The
trends are dominated by a globally consistent mode and are as
large or larger in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere as in the
Northern Hemisphere. This argues against attribution to
increased anthropogenic aerosol amounts.

United States, Canada, and Australia by Henderson-Sellers
(1992) and Karl and Steurer (1990). These studies show 20th
century increases in cloud cover over much of the United
States (mostly confined to the first 80 years) and the former
USSR, which are significantly negatively correlated with
changes in the diurnal range of surface air temperature (DTR)
(as shown earlier in Figure 2.3). Sun and Groisman (2000)
showed that in the former USSR low-level cloud cover signif-
icantly decreased during the period 1936 to 1990. However,
this was more than offset by a significant increase in cumulus
and cirrus clouds during the past several decades. Over much
of China, however, daytime and night-time total cloud cover
exhibited significant decreasing trends of 1 to 2% sky
cover/decade for both day and night observations between
1951 and 1994 (Kaiser, 1998, 2000), which the DTR failed to
follow (Figure 2.3). This discrepancy may result from the
increasing effect of industrial aerosols on the DTR since the
late 1970s (Dai er al., 1999). Tuomenvirta et al. (2000) show
increasing trends in cloud cover during the period 1910 to 1995
for northern Europe, which are consistent with decreases in the
DTR. A new analysis (Neff, 1999) reveals a dramatic increase
(15 to 20%) of spring and summer cloud amount at the South
Pole during the past four decades in this region. This appears
to be related to the observed delay in the breakdown of the
spring polar vortex and is believed to be related to decreases in

Instrumental records have been examined to search for
possible changes in ENSO over the past 120 years. Three new
reconstructions of SST in the eastern Equatorial Pacific (Figure
2.29) that use optimum interpolation methods exhibit strong
similarities. The dominant 2 to 6 year time-scale in ENSO is
apparent. Both the activity and periodicity of ENSO have varied
considerably since 1871 with considerable irregularity in time.
There was an apparent “shift” in the temperature of the tropical
Pacific around 1976 to warmer conditions, discussed in the SAR,
which appeared to continue until at least 1998. During this period
ENSO events were more frequent, intense or persistent. It is
unclear whether this warm state continues, with the persistance of
the long La Nijia from late 1998 until early 2001. ENSO has been
related to variations of precipitation and temperature over much

"Changes or fluctuations in atmospheric and oceanic circulation
are important elements of climate. Such circulation changes are
the main cause of variations in climate elements on a regional
scale, sometimes mediated by parallel changes in the land surface
(IPCC, 1990, 1996). ENSO and NAO are such examples. On
decadal time-scales, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and
the related Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) may account
for approximately half the global mean variation in surface
temperatures. They are also prominently linked to regional
variations in temperature and precipitation (Higgins er al., 2000).
This section documents regional changes and slow fluctuations in
atmospheric circulation over past decades, and demonstrates that
these are consistent with large-scale changes in other variables,
especially temperature and precipitation. Note that there is much
evidence that many of the atmospheric circulation changes we
observe, particularly in the extra-tropics, are the net result of
irregular fluctuations between preferred states of the atmosphere
(Palmer, 1993, 1999) that last for much shorter times. Thus
changes in circulation on decadal time-scales involve changes in
the frequency of such states. Chapter 7 discusses this in more
detail. The focus of this section is on long-term variation and
change, rather than on shorter-term variability.

interannual variability of ENSO over the last century, related in
part to an observed reduction in ENSO variability between about
1920 and 1960. Various studies (Wang and Wang, 1996; Torrence
and Compo, 1998; Torrence and Webster, 1998; Kestin et al.,

‘classical’ 3 to 4 year ENSO bands (3.4 and 7 years) during the
first and last 40 to 50 years of the instrumental record. A period
of very weak signal strength (with a near 5-year periodicity)

The 1990s have received considerable attention, as the recent
behaviour of ENSO seems unusual relative to that of previous
decades. A protracted period of low SOI from 1990 to 1995,
during which several weak to moderate El Nifio events occurred
with no intervening La Nifia events (Goddard and Graham, 1997)
was found by some studies (e.g., Trenberth and Hoar, 1996) to be
statistically very rare. Whether global warming is influencing El
Nifio, especially given the remarkable El Nifio of 1997/98, is a
key question (Trenberth, 1998b), especially as El Nifio affects
global temperature itself (Section 2.2 and Chapter 7).

The corresponding sea level pressure (SLP) signature is also
strongest over the North Pacific, and its December-February
counterpart in the mid-troposphere more closely resembles the
Pacific-North America (PNA) pattern (Zhang ef al., 1997b;
Livezey and Smith, 1999). There is ambiguity about whether
inter-decadal Pacific-wide features are independent of global
warming. In the longer Folland et al. (1999) analyses since 1911
they appear to be largely independent, but in the Livezey and
Smith analysis of more recent SST data they are an integral part

of data since 1901, Moron et al. (1998) find a global warming
signal whose pattern in the Pacific is intermediate between these

"The IPO shows three major phases this century: positive from
1922 to 1946 and from 1978 to at least 1998, with a negative
phase between 1947 and 1976. Arguably, the structure of this
pattern, nearly symmetrical about the equator and only subtly
different from ENSO, is a strong indication of the importance of
the tropical Pacific for many remote climates on all time-scales
(Garreaud and Battisti, 1999). Power et al. (1999) showed that the
two phases of the IPO appear to modulate year-to-year ENSO
precipitation variability over Australia. Salinger and Mullan
(1999) showed that prominent sub-bidecadal climate variations in
New Zealand, identified in the temperature signal by Folland and
Salinger (1995), are related to a SST pattern like the IPO. The IPO
is a significant source of decadal climate variation throughout the
South Pacific, and modulates ENSO climate variability in this
region (Salinger er al., 2001). Similarly, the PDO (and likely the
IPO) may play a key role in modulating ENSO teleconnections
across North America on inter-decadal time-scales (Gershunov

"The PDO of Mantua et al. (1997), with lower-frequency
variations in the leading North Pacific SST pattern, may be
related to the same Pacific-wide features, and parallels the
dominant pattern of North Pacific SLP variability. The relation-
ship is such that cooler than average SSTs occur during periods
of lower than average SLP over the central North Pacific and
vice versa. Recently, the IPO, a Pacific basin-wide feature, has
been described, which includes low-frequency variations in
climate over the North Pacific (Power et al., 1998, 1999;
Folland et al., 1999a). The time-series of this feature is broadly
similar to the inter-decadal part of the North Pacific PDO index
of Mantua et al. (1997). The IPO may be a Pacific-wide
manifestation of the PDO and seems to be part of a continuous
spectrum of low-frequency modulation of ENSO, and so may
be partly stochastic. When the IPO is in a positive phase, SST
over a large area of the south-west Pacific is cold, as is SST over
the extra-tropical north-west Pacific. SST over the central
tropical Pacific is warm but less obviously warm over the
equatorial far eastern Pacific unlike ENSO. Warmth also
extends into the tropical west Pacific, unlike the situation on the
ENSO time-scale.

The dominant pattern of atmospheric circulation variability
over the North Atlantic is known as the NAO, and its wintertime
index is shown in Figure 2.30 (updated from Hurrell, 1995). As
discussed in the SAR, positive values of the NAO give stronger
than average westerlies over the mid-latitudes of the Atlantic
with low SLP anomalies in the Icelandic region and over much
of the Arctic and high SLP anomalies across the sub-tropical
Atlantic and into southern Europe. The positive, enhanced
westerly, phase of the NAO is associated with cold winters over
the north-west Atlantic and warm winters over Europe, Siberia
and eastern Asia (Thompson and Wallace, 2001) as well as wet
conditions from Iceland to Scandinavia and dry winters over
southern Europe. A sharp reversal is evident in the NAO index
starting around 1970 from a negative towards a positive phase.

It has been known for some time that the position of the
western North Pacific sub-tropical high affects the East Asian
monsoon. Gong and Wang (1999a) showed that summer (June to
August) precipitation over central and eastern China near 30°N
is positively correlated with the intensity of the high, with
negative correlations to the north and south. A location of the
sub-tropical high further south than normal is conducive to
heavy summer rainfall in this region. Time-series of the sub-
tropical high show an increase in areal extent in the 1920s, then
another increase from the mid-1970s to 1998, giving frequent
wet summers in this region in recent years. The north-east winter
monsoon has also shown low-frequency variations. Thus the
strength of the Siberian high increased to a peak around 1968,
and then weakened to a minimum around 1990 (Gong and
Wang, 1999b), in phase with the increased frequency of the
positive phase of the NAO (Wallace, 2000 and next section).
This is likely to have contributed to strong recent winter
warming in China shown in Figure 2.10.

"(1994). A general reduction in SLP after about 1976 has been
particularly evident during the winter half (November to March)
of many of these years. This is characterised by a deeper-than-
normal Aleutian low pressure system, accompanied by stronger-
than-normal westerly winds across the central North Pacific and
enhanced southerly to south-westerly flow along the west coast of
North America, as reviewed in the SAR (Figure 3.17).
Consequently, there have been increases in surface air temperature
and SST over much of western North America and the eastern
North Pacific, respectively, over the past two decades, especially
in winter, but decreases in SST, or only modest warming, over
parts of the central extra-tropical North Pacific (Figure 2.10).
Numerous studies have suggested that the mid-1970s changes in
the atmospheric and oceanic circulation may reflect one or more
low-frequency variations over the North Pacific, one being the
PDO (Kawamura, 1994; Latif and Barnett, 1994; Mann and Park,
1994, 1996; Deser and Blackmon 1995; Zhang et al., 1997b;

"Variations in the behaviour of the North African summer
monsoon were highlighted in IPCC (1990). Moron (1997)
demonstrated that long-term variations of Sahel annual rainfall,
particularly the wet 1950s and the dry 1970 to 1980s, are seen
over the Guinea coast area, although trends are strongest in the
Sahel. The significant decrease in Guinea coast rainfall (Ward,
1998) is present in both the first and second rainy seasons, but is
strongest in the second. Janicot et al. (1996) and Moron (1997)
demonstrated that the moderate influence of ENSO (towards
drier conditions) has increased since 1960, with warm events
associated more strongly with large-scale anomalous dry
conditions over the Guinea and Sahel belts. Ward er al. (1999)
show that the Sahel has become moderately wetter since 1987,
despite the increased drying influence of ENSO events, a trend
that continued to 1999 (Parker and Horton, 2000). This recent
behaviour may be related to a quasi-hemispheric variation of
SST (e.g., Enfield and Mestas-Nufiez, 1999) shown to be related
to Sahel rainfall by Folland et al. (1986), and which may be
related to the recent strong increase in North Atlantic SST
mentioned in Section 2.2.2.2. Many other parts of tropical Africa
are influenced by ENSO towards either drier or wetter
conditions than normal, sometimes modulated by regional SST
anomalies near Africa (e.g., Nicholson and Kim, 1997;
Nicholson, 1997; Indeje et al., 2000), but few trends can be
discerned.

The changes in atmospheric circulation over the Atlantic

over the Arctic in recent years (Walsh et al., 1996). Other
features related to the circulation changes include the strength-
ening of sub-polar westerlies from the surface of the North

(Thompson et al., 2000a) and pronounced regional changes in
precipitation patterns (Hurrell, 1995; Dai et al., 1997b; Hurrell
and van Loon 1997; Section 2.5.2.1). Associated precipitation
increases have resulted in the notable advance of some
Scandinavian glaciers (Hagen et al., 1995), while decreases to

relationship between the SLP and ice anomaly fields is consis-

the sea-ice variations (Prisenberg er al., 1997). Feedbacks or
other influences of winter ice anomalies on the atmosphere
have been more difficult to detect, although Deser et al. (2000)

"Since about 1985, the NAO has tended to remain in a strong
positive phase, though with substantial interannual variability.
Hurrell (1996) and Thompson et al. (2000a) showed that the
recent upward trend in the NAO accounts for much of the
regional surface winter half-year warming over northern Europe
and Asia north of about 40°N over the past thirty years, as well
as the cooling over the north-west Atlantic (see Section 2.2.2.3).
Moreover, when circulation changes over the North Pacific are
also considered, much of the pattern of the Northern Hemisphere
winter half-year surface temperature changes since the mid-
1970s can be explained. This can be associated with changes in
the NAO, and in the PNA atmospheric pattern related to ENSO
or the PDO (Graf et al., 1995; Wallace et al., 1995; Shabbar et

A number of studies have placed the recent positive values
of the NAO into a longer-term perspective (Jones et al., 1997a;
Appenzeller et al., 1998; Cook et al., 1998; Luterbacher et al.,
1999; Osborn et al., 1999) back to the 1700s. The recent
strength of the positive phase of the NAO seems unusual from
these reconstructions but, as in Figure 2.28, these proxy data
reconstructions may underestimate variability. An extended
positive phase occurred in the early 20th century (Figure 2.30),
particularly pronounced in January (Parker and Folland, 1988),
comparable in length to the recent positive phase. Higher-
frequency variability of the NAO also appears to have varied.
Hurrell and van Loon (1997) showed that quasi-decadal (6 to
10 year) variability has become more pronounced over the
latter half of the 20th century, while quasi-biennial variability
dominated in the early instrumental record.

In the Northern Hemisphere, pronounced changes in winter
atmospheric and oceanic circulations over the North Pacific in
the 1970s (the North Pacific Oscillation) have been paralleled
by wintertime circulation changes over the North Atlantic,
recorded by the NAO. In the North Pacific, spatially coherent
changes have occurred in surface temperature across the North
Pacific and western North America, while the enhanced
westerly phase of the NAO has caused considerable winter half-
year temperature and precipitation changes over a vast area of
extra-tropical Eurasia. In the Southern Hemisphere, a feature
quite like the NAO, the HLM or the AAO, also appears to have
moved into an enhanced westerly phase in middle latitudes.

"ENSO variability is also implicated in the modulation of a
“High Latitude Mode” (HLM) (Kidson, 1988; Karoly, 1990),
especially over the austral summer. The HLM is now also called
the “Antarctic Oscillation” (AAO); they appear to be the same
phenomenon with the same structure (Thompson and Wallace,
2000). The AAO is a zonal pressure fluctuation between mid-
and high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere, centred on 55 to
60°S. It has recently been further studied (Gong and Wang,
1999c; Kidson, 1999; Thompson and Wallace, 2001; Figure
2.31) and shown to extend into the lower stratosphere between
the Antarctic and the sub-tropical latitudes of the Southern
Hemisphere. The AAO appears to persist all year but may be
most active from mid-October to mid-December when it
extends into the stratosphere (Thompson and Wallace, 2001). In
its high index phase, it consists of low pressure or heights above
the Antarctic and the near Southern Ocean with high heights
north of about 50°S. Although the data are sparse, there is
evidence that, like the NAO, the AAO has tended to move more
towards a positive index phase, despite lower pressures being
observed over the New Zealand region during the 1990s. This
change is also associated with with increasing westerly winds
in mid-latitudes. Thompson and Wallace (2001) show that most
of Antarctica is rather cold in this phase, except for the
Antarctic Peninsula which is warm due to additional advection
of relatively warm air from seas to the west. This may explain
some of the behaviour of Antarctic temperatures in the last two
decades (Figure 2.10; Comiso, 2000).

Consequently, even when changes in extremes can be
documented, unless a specific analysis has been completed, it
is often uncertain whether the changes are caused by a change
in the mean, variance, or both. In addition, uncertainties in the
rate of change of the mean confound interpretation of changes
in variance since all variance statistics are dependent on a
reference level, i.e., the mean.

This section considers the changes in variability and
extremes simultaneously for two variables, temperature and
precipitation. We include new analyses and additional data
compiled since the SAR which provide new insights. We also
assess new information related to changes in extreme weather
and climate phenomena, e.g., tropical cyclones, tornadoes,
etc. In these analyses, the primary focus is on assessing the
stationarity (e.g., the null hypothesis of no change) of these
events, given numerous inhomogeneities in monitoring.

For variables that are not well approximated by normal
distributions, like precipitation, the situation is even more
complex, especially for dry climates. For precipitation, for
example, changes in the mean total precipitation can be
accompanied by other changes like the frequency of precipi-
tation or the shape of the distribution including its variability.
All these changes can affect the various aspects of precipita-
tion extremes including the intensity of precipitation (amount
per unit time).

"Changes in climate variability and extremes of weather and
climate events have received increased attention in the last few
years. Understanding changes in climate variability and
climate extremes is made difficult by interactions between the
changes in the mean and variability (Meehl et al., 2000). Such
interactions vary from variable to variable depending on their
statistical distribution. For example, the distribution of
temperatures often resembles a normal distribution where
non-stationarity of the distribution implies changes in the
mean or variance. In such a distribution, an increase in the
"	Text
"mean leads to new record high temperatures (Figure 2.32a),
but a change in the mean does not imply any change in
variability. For example, in Figure 2.32a, the range between
the hottest and coldest temperatures does not change. An
increase in variability without a change in the mean implies an
increase in the probability of both hot and cold extremes as
well as the absolute value of the extremes (Figure 2.32b).
Increases in both the mean and the variability are also possible
(Figure 2.32c), which affects (in this example) the probability
of hot and cold extremes, with more frequent hot events with
more extreme high temperatures and fewer cold events. Other
combinations of changes in both mean and variability would

lead to different results.

"The issues involved in measuring and assessing changes in
extremes have recently been comprehensively reviewed by
Trenberth and Owen (1999), Nicholls and Murray (1999), and
Folland et al. (1999b). Despite some progress described
below, there remains a lack of accessible daily climate data
sets which can be intercompared over large regions (Folland et
al., 2000). Extremes are a key aspect of climate change.
Changes in the frequency of many extremes (increases or
decreases) can be surprisingly large for seemingly modest
mean changes in climate (Katz, 1999) and are often the most
sensitive aspects of climate change for ecosystem and societal
responses. Moreover, changes in extremes are often most
sensitive to inhomogeneous climate monitoring practices,
making assessment of change more difficult than assessing the
change in the mean.

Consequently, there is now little evidence to suggest that the
interannual variability of global temperatures has increased over
the past few decades, but there is some evidence to suggest that the
variability of intra-annual temperatures has actually quite widely
decreased. Several analyses find a decrease in spatial and temporal
variability of temperatures on these shorter time-scales.

Given the number of ways in which extreme climate events and
variability about the mean can be defined, (e.g., extreme daily
temperatures, large areas experiencing unusual temperatures,
severity of heat waves, number of frosts or freezes, changes in
interannual variability of large area temperatures, etc.) extreme
care must be exercised in generalising results. Here we assess the
evidence for changes in temperature extremes or variability, first

duration episodes (a few days) of extreme hot or cold weather did
not show any significant changes in frequency or intensity

Collins et al. (2000) found higher frequencies of multi-day warm
nights and days, and decreases in the frequency of cool days and
nights. In an extensive assessment of the change in frequency of
heat waves during the latter half of the 20th century, Frich et al.
(2001) find some evidence for an increase in heat-wave frequency,
but several regions have opposite trends (Figure 2.33c). The
extreme heat in the United States during several years in the 1930s

"Parker et al. (1994) compared the interannual variability of
seasonal temperature anomalies from the 1954 to 1973 period to
the 1974 to 1993 period for most of the globe. They found a small
increase in variability overall with an especially large increase in
central North America. By restricting the analyses to the latter half
of the 20th century, Parker et al. (1994) minimised the potential
biases due to an increasing number of observations in this period.
Several other studies found a reduction in other aspects of
variability over longer time periods. Jones (1999) also analysed
global data and found no change in variability, but since 1951 the
rise in global mean temperatures can be attributed to an increase
(decrease) in areas with much above (below) normal tempera-
tures. They also analysed the change in the aggregated total of
much below and much above normal temperatures (upper and
lower ten percentiles). They found little overall change, except for
a reduced number of much above or below normal temperatures
during the 1960s and 1970s. Michaels et al. (1998) examined 5°
latitude x 5° longitude monthly temperature anomalies for many
grid cells around the world and found an overall decrease in intra-
annual variance over the past 50 to 100 years. They also examined
the daily maximum and minimum temperatures from the United
States, China, and the former Soviet Union and found a general
decline in the intra-monthly temperature variability. As reported in
the SAR, a related analysis by Karl et al. (1995b) found reduced
day-to-day variability during the 20th century in the Northern
Hemisphere, particularly in the United States and China. Recently,
Collins et al. (2000) has identified similar trends in Australia. By
analysing a long homogenised daily temperature index for four
stations in Northern Europe, Moberg er al. (2000) also found a
progressive reduction in all-seasons inter-daily variability of about
7% between 1880 and 1998. Balling (1998) found an overall
decrease in the spatial variance of both satellite-based lower-
tropospheric measurements from 1979 to 1996 and in near-surface

air temperatures from 1897 to 1996.

"latitudes and found a statistically significant increase (5 to >15%)
in the growing season length in many regions. Heino et al. (1999)
also found that there has been a reduction in the number of days
with frost (the number of days with minimum temperature <0°C)
in northern and central Europe. Thus, some stations now have as
many as 50 fewer days of frost per year compared with earlier in
the 20th century. Easterling et al. (2000) found there has been a
significant decrease in the number of days below freezing over the
central United States (about seven per year). For Canada, Bonsal
et al. (2001) also found fewer days with extreme low temperatures
during winter, spring and summer, and more days with extreme
high temperatures during winter and spring. This has led to a
significant increase in the frost-free period. Decreasing numbers
of days with freezing temperatures have been found in Australia
and New Zealand over recent decades (Plummer et al., 1999;
Collins et al., 2000). In addition, while increases in the frequency
of warm days have been observed, decreases in the number of cool
nights have been stronger. Frich et al. (2001) show a reduced
number of days with frost across much of the globe (Figure 2.33)
while Michaels et al. (2000) find that much of the warming during
the 20th century has been during the cold season in the mid- to
high latitudes, consistent with the reduction of extremely low
temperatures. Frich et al. (2001) have also found a statistically
significant reduction in the difference between the annual
extremes of daily maximum and minimum temperatures during
the latter half of the 20th century. In China, strong increases in the
absolute minimum temperature have been observed, with
decreases in the 1-day seasonal extreme maximum temperature
(Zhai et al., 1999a) since the 1950s. Wang and Gaffen (2001),
however, for a similar period, found an increase in “hot” days in
China. Hot days were defined as those days above the 85th
percentile during July and August based on an “apparent temper-
ature” index related to human discomfort in China (Steadman,
1984). The number of extremely cold days has also been shown to
be decreasing in China (Zhai et al., 1999a). Manton et al. (2001)
found significant increases in hot days and warm nights, and
decreases in cool days and cold nights since 1961 across the
Southeast Asia and South Pacific Region. Jones et al. (1999c)
have analysed the 230-year-long daily central England data set
that has been adjusted for observing inhomogeneities. They found
that the increase in temperature observed in central England
corresponds mainly to a reduction in the frequency of much below
normal daily temperatures. An increase of the frequency of much
above normal temperatures was less apparent.

During the 1997/98 El Nifio event, global temperature
records were broken for sixteen consecutive months from May
1997 through to August 1998. Karl et al. (2000) describe this as
an unusual event and such a monthly sequence is unprecedented
in the observational record. More recently, Wigley (2000) argues
that if it were not for the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo, an approxi-
mately equal number of record-breaking temperatures would have
been set during the El Nifio of 1990/91. As temperatures continue
to warm, more events like these are likely, especially when
enhanced by other factors, such as El Nifio.

"A better understanding of the relationship between changes in
total precipitation and intense precipitation events has been
achieved since the SAR. Although many areas of the globe have
not been analysed, and considerable data remain inaccessible,
enough data have been analysed to confirm some basic properties
of the changes in extreme precipitation. Groisman et al. (1999)
developed a simple statistical model of the frequency of daily
precipitation based on the gamma distribution. They applied this
model to a variety of regions around the world (40% of the global
land area) during the season of greatest precipitation. Although
Wilks (1999) shows that the gamma distribution under some
circumstances can underestimate the probability of the highest
rainfall amounts, Groisman et al. (1999) applied the distribution
to the upper 5 and 10 percentiles of the distribution which are less
subject to underestimation. Their analysis period varied from
region to region, but within each region it generally spanned at

"Increases in heavy precipitation have also been documented
even when mean total precipitation decreases (for example, see
Northern Japan in Figure 2.35, or Manton et al., 2001). This can
occur when the probability of precipitation (the number of
events) decreases, or if the shape of the precipitation distribution
changes, but this latter situation is less likely (Buffoni er al.,
1999; Groisman er al., 1999; Brunetti et al., 2000a,b). For
example, in Siberia for the summer season during the years 1936
to 1994 there was a statistically significant decrease in total
precipitation of 1.3%/decade, but the number of days with
precipitation also decreased. This resulted in an increase
(1.9%/decade) in the frequency of heavy rainfall above 25 mm.
The opposite can also occur when the number of rainfall events
increases; thus Ferland er al. (1998) found no trends in 1-day
annual maximum precipitation in the Nordic countries, even

when mean total precipitation increased.

"Africa). In the model used by Groisman et al. (1999), the mean
total precipitation is also proportional to the shape and scale
parameters of the gamma distribution as well as to the probability
of precipitation on any given day. The shape parameter of the
gamma distribution tends to be relatively stable across a wide
range of precipitation regimes, in contrast to the scale parameter.
Given the conservative nature of the shape parameter, it is possible
to illustrate the relationships between changes in the mean total
precipitation, the probability of precipitation (which is propor-
tional to the number of days with precipitation), and changes in
heavy precipitation (Figure 2.34). Given no change in the
frequency (number of days) of precipitation, a 10% change in the
mean total precipitation is amplified to a larger percentage change
in heavy precipitation rates compared to the change in the mean.
Using the statistical theory of extremes, Katz (1999) obtained
results consistent with those of Groisman et al. (1999). For many
regions of the world it appears that the changes in the frequency
or probability of precipitation events are either small enough, or
well enough expressed in the high rainfall rates (Karl and Knight,
1998; Gruza et al., 1999; Haylock and Nicholls, 2000) that an
increase in the mean total precipitation is disproportionately
reflected in increased heavy precipitation rates (Figure 2.35)

"frequency of rainfall events has been responsible for the decrease

been a decrease in the heaviest daily precipitation amounts,

the Ethiopian plateau (Nicholson, 1993; Tarhule and Woo, 1998;

Since large portions of the mid- and high latitude land areas
have had increasing precipitation during the last half the 20th
century, the question arises as to how much of this area is affected
by increases in heavy and extreme precipitation rates. The Frich et
al. (2001) analysis suggests an overall increase in the area affected
by more intense daily rainfall. Figure 2.36 shows that widely
distributed parts of the mid- and high latitudes have locally statis-
tically significant increases in both the proportion of mean annual
total precipitation falling into the upper five percentiles and in the
annual maximum consecutive 5-day precipitation total. However,
for the regions of the globe sampled taken as a whole, only the
latter statistic shows a significant increase. Regional analyses in

"Russia (Gruza et al., 1999), the United States (Karl and Knight,
1998) and elsewhere (Groisman et al., 1999; Easterling er al.,

uniform, as would be anticipated with the relatively high spatial
and interannual variability of precipitation, about 10% of the
stations analysed show statistically significant increases at the 5%
level. This equates to about a 4% increase in the annual maximum
5-day precipitation total (Figure 2.36b). The number of stations
reflecting a locally significant increase in the proportion of total
annual precipitation occurring in the upper five percentiles of
daily precipitation totals outweighs the number of stations with
significantly decreasing trends by more than 3 to | (Figure 2.36c).
Although not statistically significant when averaging over all
stations, there is about a 1% increase in the proportion of daily
precipitation events occurring in the upper five percentiles (Figure
2.36d). Overall, it is likely that there has been a 2 to 4% increase
in the number of heavy precipitation events when averaged across

"and Slack (1999) could not detect an increase in the upper
quantiles of streamflow, despite the documented increase in
heavy and extreme precipitation events. It is possible that this null
result is partly due to the method of analysis, but it is also attrib-
utable to the timing of the annual peak streamflow discharge,
which in the United States is usually in late winter or early spring.
A reduced snow cover extent in the mountainous West changes
the peak river flow, as does timing of increases in heavy and
extreme precipitation reported in the United States, which is best
reflected during the warm season. Groisman ef al. (2001) and
Zhang et al. (2000) also show reduced peak streamflow in areas
with reduced spring snow cover extent. Nonetheless, in much of
the United States where spring snow melt does not dominate
peak or normal flow, Groisman er al. (2001) show increasing
high streamflow related to increasing heavy precipitation.

"This section updates the information provided in the SAR
regarding changes in tropical cyclones across various ocean
basins and those affecting the nearby continents. As reported in
the SAR, a part of the multi-decadal trend of tropical cyclones
occurring in the Australian region (105° to 160°E) is likely to be
artificial, as the forecasters in the region no longer classify some
weak (>990 hPa central pressure) systems as “cyclones”
(Nicholls et al., 1998). By considering only the moderate and
intense tropical cyclones (central pressure <990 hPa), this artificial
trend is eliminated. The remaining moderate and strong tropical
cyclones reveal a numerical decline since the late 1980s, but the
trend is not statistically significant. Similarly, the trend in intense
tropical cyclones (minimum central pressure below 970 hPa) is
not significantly different from zero. Nicholls et al. (1998) attrib-
uted the decrease in moderate cyclones to more frequent
occurrences of El Nifio during the 1980s and 1990s. However, a
weak trend in the intense tropical cyclones implies that while
ENSO modulates the total frequency of cyclones in the region,
other factors must be more important in regulating their intensity.
For example, new work by Higgins and Shi (2000) and Maloney
and Hartmann (2001) show that 30 to 80 day Madden-Julian
oscillations modulate tropical cyclone activity.

Hourly values of water levels provide a unique record of
tropical and extra-tropical storms where stations exist. Zhang et
al. (1997a) have analysed century-long records along the East
Coast of the United States. They calculated several different
measures of storm severity, but did not find any long-term trends.
On the other hand, they did find that the effect of sea level rise
over the last century has exacerbated the beach erosion and
flooding from modern storms that would have been less damaging

Using historical records, Fernandez-Partagas and Diaz

activity for the years 1851 to 1890 was 12% lower than the
corresponding forty year period of 1951 to 1990, although little
can be said regarding the intense hurricanes. They based this
assessment upon a constant ratio of USA landfalling tropical
cyclones to all-basin activity, which is likely to be valid for multi-

with these frequency changes, there have been periods with a
strong mean intensity of the North Atlantic tropical cyclones (mid-

wind found by Jones er al. (1999c). This increase is also consis-

focused on hemispheric changes in cyclone activity. Lambert

North Pacific Oceans for the period 1891 to 1991. He found a
significant increase in intense extra-tropical storms, especially
over the last two decades of his analysis, but the data were not
completely homogenised. Simmonds and Keay (2000) used data
from 1958 to 1997 in the Southern Hemisphere and found an
increase in cyclone activity through 1972 before decreasing
through 1997 with strong decreases during the 1990s.

It appears that recent work points towards increases over time
in extra-tropical cyclone activity during the latter half of the 20th
century in the Northern Hemisphere, and decreased activity in the
Southern Hemisphere. However, the mechanisms involved are not
clear, and it is not certain whether the trends are multi-decadal
fluctuations, or rather part of a longer-term trend. Furthermore
decreased cyclone activity in higher latitudes of the Southern
Hemisphere is not obviously consistent with an increase in the
positive phase of the Antarctic Oscillation in the last fifteen years
or so (Section 2.6.6). A more fundamental question is whether we
would expect more or fewer extra-tropical cyclones with
increased warming. As pointed out by Simmonds and Keay
(2000), the specific humidity increases as temperatures increase,
and this increased moisture should enhance extra-tropical
cyclones, but Zhang and Wang (1997) suggest that cyclones
transport energy more efficiently in a more moist atmosphere,
therefore requiring fewer extra-tropical cyclones (see Chapters 7
and 10 for more discussion).

"Extra-tropical cyclones are baroclinic low pressure systems that
occur throughout the mid-latitudes of both hemispheres. Their
potential for causing property damage, particularly as winter
storms, is well documented, where the main interest is in wind
and wind-generated waves. In place of direct wind measure-
ments, which suffer from lack of consistency of instrumentation,
methodology and exposure, values based on SLP gradients have
been derived which are more reliable for discerning long-term
changes. Over the oceans, the additional measurements of wave
heights and tide gauge measurements provide additional ways of
indirectly evaluating changes in extra-tropical storm strength and
frequency (see Chapter 11, Section 11.3.3). Global analyses of
changes in extra-tropical storm frequency and intensity have not
been attempted, but there have been several large-scale studies.
Jones et al. (1999c) developed a gale index of geostrophic flow
and vorticity over the UK for the period 1881 to 1997. This
revealed an increase in the number of severe gale days over the
UK since the 1960s, but no long-term increase when considering
the century period. Serreze et al. (1997) found increases in cold
season cyclones in the Arctic region for the period 1966 to 1993.
Angel and Isard (1998) found significant increases in strong
cyclones (<993 mb) in the Great Lakes region from 1900 to 1990
during the cold season. Graham and Diaz (2001) find evidence
for increases in strong cyclones over the Pacific Ocean between
25 and 40°N since 1948 and link the increase to increasing sea
surface temperatures in the western Tropical Pacific.
Alexandersson et al. (1998, 2000) similarly studied extreme
geostrophic wind events in the north-western European area

increases in either the dry area, e.g., over the Sahel, eastern Asia

for the Sahel, however, the magnitude of dry and wet areas of the

should be noted that rainfall in the Sahel since the height of the

A regional analysis assessed the temporal fluctuations and

trends in hail-day and thunder-day occurrences during a 100-
year period, from 1896 to 1995, derived from carefully
screened records of 67 stations distributed across the United
States. Upward hail day trends were found in the High Plains-
Rockies and the south-east, contrasting with areas with no trend
in the northern Midwest and along the East Coast, and with
downward trends elsewhere (Changnon and Changnon, 2000).
The major regions of decrease and increase in hail activity
match regions of increased and decreased thunder activity for
1901 to 1980 well (Changnon, 1985; Gabriel and Changnon,
1990) and also crop-hail insurance losses (Changnon ef al.,
1996; Changnon and Changnon, 1997). In general, hail
frequency shows a general decrease for most of the United
States over the last century, with increases over the High Plains,
the region where most of the crop-hail damage occurs in the
United States. So, despite an increase in minimum temperature
of more than 1°C since 1900 and an increase in tropospheric
water vapour over the United States since 1973 (when records
are deemed reliable), no systematic increase in hail or thunder
days was found.

"Small-scale severe weather phenomena (SCSWP) are primarily
characterised by quasi-random temporal and spatial events.
These events, in turn, have local and regional impacts, often with
significant damage and sometimes loss of life. Tornadoes and
thunderstorms and related phenomena such as lightning, hail,
wind, dust, water spouts, downpours and cloudbursts belong to
this group. In the light of the very strong spatial variability of
SCSWP, the density of surface meteorological observing stations
is too coarse to measure all such events. Moreover, areally consis-
tent values of SCSWP are inherently elusive. Statistics of
relatively rare events are not stable at single stations, observa-
tional practices can be subjective and change over time, and the
metadata outlining these practices are often not readily available
to researchers. For these reasons, monitoring the occurrence of
local maxima and minima in smoothed SCSWP series, as well as
checking for trends of the same sign for different but related
SCSWP (e.g., thunderstorms, hail, cloud bursts), are important
for checking inconsistencies. Because of the inherent difficulty in
working with these data, there have been relatively few large-
scale analyses of changes and variations in these events.
Nonetheless, a few new regional analyses have been completed
since the SAR.

"Based on new analyses since the SAR, it is likely that there has
been a widespread increase in heavy and extreme precipitation
events in regions where total precipitation has increased, e.g.,
the mid- and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.
Increases in the mean have often been found to be amplified in
the highest precipitation rates total. In some regions, increases
in heavy rainfall have been identified where the total precipita-
tion has decreased or remained constant, such as eastern Asia.
This is attributed to a decrease in the frequency of precipitation.
Fewer areas have been identified where decreases in total
annual precipitation have been associated with decreases in the
highest precipitation rates, but some have been found.
Temperature variability has decreased on intra-seasonal and
daily time-scales in limited regional studies. New record high
night-time minimum temperatures are lengthening the freeze
and frost season in many mid- and high latitude regions. The
increase in global temperatures has resulted mainly from a
significant reduction in the frequency of much below normal
seasonal mean temperatures across much of the globe, with a
corresponding smaller increase in the frequency of much above
normal temperatures. There is little sign of long-term changes
in tropical storm intensity and frequency, but inter-decadal
variations are pronounced. Owing to incomplete data and
relatively few analyses, we are uncertain as to whether there has
been any large-scale, long-term increase in the Northern
Hemisphere extra-tropical cyclone intensity and frequency
though some, sometimes strong, multi-decadal variations and
recent increases were identified in several regions. Limited
evidence exists for a decrease in cyclone frequency in the
Southern Hemisphere since the early 1970s, but there has been
a paucity of analyses and data. Recent analyses of changes in
severe local weather (tornadoes, thunder days, lightning and

"to 0.61°C/century) over the 20th century.

The nearly worldwide decrease in mountain glacier extent and
mass is consistent with 20th century global temperature
increases. A few recent exceptions in maritime areas have been
affected by atmospheric circulation variations and related
precipitation increases.

Though less certain, substantial proxy evidence points to the
exceptional warmth of the late 20th century relative to the last
1,000 years. The 1990s are likely to have been the warmest
decade of the past 1,000 years over the Northern Hemisphere
as a whole.

Satellite and balloon measurements agree that lower-tropo-
spheric temperatures have increased only slightly since 1979,
though there has been a faster rate of global surface temp-
erature increase. Balloon measurements indicate a larger lower-
tropospheric temperature increase since 1958, similar to that
shown by global surface temperature measurements over the
same period. Balloon and satellite measurements agree that
lower-stratospheric temperatures have declined significantly
since 1979.

Since 1979, trends in worldwide land-surface air temperature
derived from weather stations in the Northern Hemisphere, in
regions where urbanisation is likely to have been strong, agree
closely with satellite derived temperature trends in the lower
troposphere above the same regions. This suggests that urban
heat island biases have not significantly affected surface
temperature over the period.

The decrease in the continental diurnal temperature range since
around 1950 coincides with increases in cloud amount and, at
least since the mid-1970s in the Northern Hemisphere,
increases in water vapour.

Decreases in spring snow cover extent since the 1960s, and in
the duration of lake and river ice over at least the last century,
relate well to increases in Northern Hemispheric surface air
temperatures.

The systematic decrease in spring and summer Arctic sea-ice
extent in recent decades is broadly consistent with increases of
temperature over most of the adjacent land and ocean. The
large reduction in the thickness of summer and early autumn
Arctic sea ice over the last thirty to forty years is consistent

The land-atmosphere flux estimated from atmospheric
observations comprises the balance of net CO, release due to
land-use changes and CO, uptake by terrestrial systems (the
“residual terrestrial sink”). The residual terrestrial sink is
estimated as —1.9 PgC/yr (range —3.8 to +0.3 PgC/yr) during the
1980s. It has several likely causes, including changes in land
management practices and fertilisation effects of increased
atmospheric CO, and nitrogen (N) deposition, leading to
increased vegetation and soil carbon.

Statistically, high rates of increase in atmospheric CO, have
occurred in most El Nifio years, although low rates occurred
during the extended El Nifio of 1991 to 1994, Surface water CO,
measurements from the equatorial Pacific show that the natural
source of CO, from this region is reduced by between 0.2 and 1.0
PgC/yr during El Nifio events, counter to the atmospheric
increase. It is likely that the high rates of CO, increase during
most El Nifio events are explained by reductions in land uptake,
caused in part by the effects of high temperatures, drought and

fire on terrestrial ecosystems in the tropics.

Modelling based on atmospheric observations (inverse
modelling) enables the land-atmosphere and ocean-atmosphere
fluxes to be partitioned between broad latitudinal bands. The sites
of anthropogenic CO, uptake in the ocean are not resolved by
inverse modelling because of the large, natural background air-
sea fluxes (outgassing in the tropics and uptake in high latitudes).
Estimates of the land-atmosphere flux north of 30°N during 1980
to 1989 range from —2.3 to —0.6 PgC/yr; for the tropics, —1.0 to
+1.5 PgC/yr. These results imply substantial terrestrial sinks for
anthropogenic CO, in the northern extra-tropics, and in the
tropics (to balance deforestation). The pattern for the 1980s
persisted into the 1990s.

Land and ocean uptake of CO, can now be separated using
atmospheric measurements (CO, oxygen (Oz) and '3CO,). For
1980 to 1989, the ocean-atmosphere flux is estimated as —1.9 +
0.6 PgC/yr and the land-atmosphere flux as —-0.2 + 0.7 PgC/yr
based on CO, and O, measurements (negative signs denote net
uptake). For 1990 to 1999, the ocean-atmosphere flux is
estimated as —1.7 + 0.5 PgC/yr and the land-atmosphere flux as
—1.4 + 0.7 PgC/yr. These figures are consistent with alternative
budgets based on CO, and '3CO, measurements, and with
independent estimates based on measurements of CO, and '°CO,
in sea water. The new 1980s estimates are also consistent with the
ocean-model based carbon budget of the IPCC WGI Second
Assessment Report (IPCC, 1996a) (hereafter SAR). The new
1990s estimates update the budget derived using SAR method-
ologies for the IPCC Special Report on Land Use, Land Use
Change and Forestry (IPCC, 2000a).

"Responses of the carbon cycle to changing CO, concentrations
¢ Uptake of anthropogenic CO, by the ocean is primarily
governed by ocean circulation and carbonate chemistry. So
long as atmospheric CO, concentration is increasing there is net
uptake of carbon by the ocean, driven by the atmosphere-ocean
difference in partial pressure of CO). The fraction of anthro-
pogenic CO, that is taken up by the ocean declines with
increasing CO, concentration, due to reduced buffer capacity of
the carbonate system. The fraction taken up by the ocean also
declines with the rate of increase of atmospheric CO;, because
the rate of mixing between deep water and surface water limits
CO) uptake.

Increasing atmospheric CO, has no significant fertilisation
effect on marine biological productivity, but it decreases pH.

uptake of CO) by the ocean.

Increased vertical stratification in the ocean is likely to
accompany increasing global temperature. The likely
consequences include reduced outgassing of upwelled CO),
reduced transport of excess carbon to the deep ocean, and
changes in biological productivity.

On short time-scales, warming increases the rate of
heterotrophic respiration on land, but the extent to which this
effect can alter land-atmosphere fluxes over longer time-
scales is not yet clear. Warming, and regional changes in
precipitation patterns and cloudiness, are also likely to bring
about changes in terrestrial ecosystem structure, geographic

"¢ Terrestrial uptake of CO, is governed by net biome produc-
tion (NBP), which is the balance of net primary production
(NPP) and carbon losses due to heterotrophic respiration
(decomposition and herbivory) and fire, including the fate of
harvested biomass. NPP increases when atmospheric CO,
concentration is increased above present levels (the “fertili-
sation” effect occurs directly through enhanced photo-
synthesis, and indirectly through effects such as increased
water use efficiency). At high CO, concentration (800 to
1,000 ppm) any further direct CO, fertilisation effect is likely
to be small. The effectiveness of terrestrial uptake as a carbon
sink depends on the transfer of carbon to forms with long
residence times (wood or modified soil organic matter).
Management practices can enhance the carbon sink because
of the inertia of these “slow” carbon pools.

¢ Changes in management practices are very likely to have
significant effects on the terrestrial carbon cycle. In addition
to deforestation and afforestation/reforestation, more subtle
management effects can be important. For example, fire
suppression (e.g., in savannas) reduces CO, emissions from
burning, and encourages woody plant biomass to increase.
On agricultural lands, some of the soil carbon lost when land
was cleared and tilled can be regained through adoption of
low-tillage agriculture.

¢ Anthropogenic N deposition is increasing terrestrial NPP in
some regions; excess tropospheric ozone (O3) is likely to be
reducing NPP.

atmospheric dust may influence marine biological produc-
tivity, although such effects are poorly quantified.

the projected range of CO, concentrations at the end of the

(Bern-CC model).

Variations in climate sensitivity and ocean and terrestrial

these values, and to the emissions implied by the stabilisation

The part of fossil fuel CO, that is taken up by the ocean and
the part that is taken up by the land can be calculated from the
changes in atmospheric CO, and O, content because terrestrial
processes of CO, exchange involve exchange of oxygen whereas
dissolution in the ocean does not. Global carbon budgets based
on CO, and O, measurements for the 1980s and 1990s are

Several additional lines of evidence confirm that the recent
and continuing increase of atmospheric CO) content is caused
by anthropogenic CO, emissions — most importantly fossil fuel
burning. First, atmospheric O) is declining at a rate comparable
with fossil fuel emissions of CO, (combustion consumes O,).
Second, the characteristic isotopic signatures of fossil fuel (its
lack of '4C, and depleted content of °C) leave their mark in the
atmosphere. Third, the increase in observed CO, concentration
has been faster in the northern hemisphere, where most fossil
fuel burning occurs.

be restored to the terrestrial biosphere, CO, at the end of the

thick arrows denote the most important fluxes from the point of view of the contemporary CO, balance of the atmosphere: gross primary produc-
tion and respiration by the land biosphere, and physical air-sea exchange. These fluxes are approximately balanced each year, but imbalances can
affect atmospheric CO) concentration significantly over years to centuries. The thin arrows denote additional natural fluxes (dashed lines for
fluxes of carbon as CaCO ), which are important on longer time-scales. The flux of 0.4 PgC/yr from atmospheric CO) via plants to inert soil
carbon is approximately balanced on a time-scale of several millenia by export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in rivers (Schlesinger, 1990). A
further 0.4 PgC/yr flux of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is derived from the weathering of CaCO, which takes up CO, from the atmosphere in
a 1:1 ratio. These fluxes of DOC and DIC together comprise the river transport of 0.8 PgC/yr. In the ocean, the DOC from rivers is respired and
released to the atmosphere, while CaCO; production by marine organisms results in half of the DIC from rivers being returned to the atmosphere
and half being buried in deep-sea sediments — which are the precursor of carbonate rocks. Also shown are processes with even longer time-scales:
burial of organic matter as fossil organic carbon (including fossil fuels), and outgassing of CO, through tectonic processes (vulcanism). Emissions
due to vulcanism are estimated as 0.02 to 0.05 PgC/yr (Williams ef al., 1992; Bickle, 1994). (b) The human perturbation (data from Table 3.1).
Fossil fuel burning and land-use change are the main anthropogenic processes that release CO) to the atmosphere. Only a part of this CO, stays in
the atmosphere; the rest is taken up by the land (plants and soil) or by the ocean. These uptake components represent imbalances in the large
natural two-way fluxes between atmosphere and ocean and between atmosphere and land. (c) Carbon cycling in the ocean. CO, that dissolves in
the ocean is found in three main forms (CO), coy, HCOs, the sum of which is DIC). DIC is transported in the ocean by physical and biological
processes. Gross primary production (GPP) is the total amount of organic carbon produced by photosynthesis (estimate from Bender et al., 1994);
net primary production (NPP) is what is what remains after autotrophic respiration, i.e., respiration by photosynthetic organisms (estimate from
Falkowski et al., 1998). Sinking of DOC and particulate organic matter (POC) of biological origin results in a downward flux known as export
production (estimate from Schlitzer, 2000). This organic matter is tranported and respired by non-photosynthetic organisms (heterotrophic respira-
tion) and ultimately upwelled and returned to the atmosphere. Only a tiny fraction is buried in deep-sea sediments. Export of CaCO; to the deep
ocean is a smaller flux than total export production (0.4 PgC/yr) but about half of this carbon is buried as CaCO; in sediments; the other half is
dissolved at depth, and joins the pool of DIC (Milliman, 1993). Also shown are approximate fluxes for the shorter-term burial of organic carbon
and CaCO; in coastal sediments and the re-dissolution of a part of the buried CaCO; from these sediments. (d) Carbon cycling on land. By
contrast with the ocean, most carbon cycling through the land takes place locally within ecosystems. About half of GPP is respired by plants. The
remainer (NPP) is approximately balanced by heterotrophic respiration with a smaller component of direct oxidation in fires (combustion).
Through senescence of plant tissues, most of NPP joins the detritus pool; some detritus decomposes (i.e., is respired and returned to the
atmosphere as CO ) quickly while some is converted to modified soil carbon, which decomposes more slowly. The small fraction of modified soil
carbon that is further converted to compounds resistant to decomposition, and the small amount of black carbon produced in fires, constitute the
“inert” carbon pool. It is likely that biological processes also consume much of the “inert” carbon as well but little is currently known about these
processes. Estimates for soil carbon amounts are from Batjes (1996) and partitioning from Schimel et al. (1994) and Falloon et al. (1998). The
estimate for the combustion flux is from Scholes and Andreae (2000). ‘t’ denotes the turnover time for different components of soil organic matter.

Ecosystem-atmosphere CO, exchange on short time-scales can be measured using micrometeorological techniques such as
eddy covariance, which relies on rapidly responding sensors mounted on towers to resolve the net flux of CO, between a patch
of land and the atmosphere (Baldocchi er al., 1988). The annual integral of the measured CO, exchange is approximately equiva-
lent to NEP (Wofsy et al., 1993; Goulden et. al, 1996; Aubinet ef al., 2000). This innovation has led to the establishment of a
rapidly expanding network of long-term monitoring sites (FLUXNET) with many sites now operating for several years,
improving the understanding of the physiological and ecological processes that control NEP (e.g., Valentini et al., 2000). The
distribution of sites is currently biased toward regrowing forests in the Northern Hemisphere, and there are still technical

problems and uncertainties, although these are being tackled. Current flux measurement techniques typically integrate processes
at a scale less than 1 km’.

"The carbon density of vegetation and soils has been measured in numerous ecological field studies that have been aggregated
to a global scale to assess carbon stocks and NPP (e.g., Atjay et al., 1979; Olson et al., 1983; Saugier and Roy, 2001; Table 3.2),
although high spatial and temporal heterogeneity and methodological differences introduce large uncertainties. Land inventory
studies tend to measure the carbon stocks in vegetation and soils over larger areas and/or longer time periods. For example, the
United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) has been compiling forest inventories since 1946 providing detailed
data on carbon stocks, often based on commercial wood production data. Inventory studies include managed forests with mixed
age stands, thus average carbon stock values are often lower than those based on ecological site studies, which have generally
been carried out in relatively undisturbed, mature ecosystems. Fluxes of carbon can be estimated from changes in inventoried
carbon stocks (e.g., UN-ECE/FAO, 2000), or from combining data on land-use change with methods to calculate changes in
carbon stock (e.g., Houghton, 1999). The greatest uncertainty in both methods is in estimating the fate of the carbon: the fraction
which is burned, rates of decomposition, the effect of burning and harvesting on soil carbon, and subsequent land management.

fires, harvesting/removals (eventually combusted or
decomposed), erosion and export of dissolved or suspended
organic carbon (DOC) by rivers to the oceans (Schlesinger and
Melack, 1981; Sarmiento and Sundquist; 1992), what remains is
the net biome production (NBP), i.e., the carbon accumulated by
the terrestrial biosphere (Schulze and Heimann, 1998). This is
what the atmosphere ultimately “sees” as the net land uptake on
a global scale over periods of a year or more. NBP is estimated
in this chapter to have averaged —0.2 + 0.7 PgC/yr during the
1980s and —1.4 + 0.7 PgC/yr during the 1990s, based on

between the land and atmosphere, represent a sizeable fraction of

The difference between NPP and Rh determines how much
carbon is lost or gained by the ecosystem in the absence of
disturbances that remove carbon from the ecosystem (such as
harvest or fire). This carbon balance, or net ecosystem produc-
tion (NEP), can be estimated from changes in carbon stocks, or
by measuring the fluxes of CO, between patches of land and the
atmosphere (see Box 3.1). Annual NEP flux measurements are
in the range 0.7 to 5.9 MgC/ha/yr for tropical forests and 0.8 to
7.0 MgC/ha/yr for temperate forests; boreal forests can reach up
to 2.5 MgC/ha/yr although they have been shown to be carbon-
neutral or to release carbon in warm and/or cloudy years
(Valentini et al., 2000). Integration of these and other results
leads to an estimated global NEP of about 10 PgC/yr, although
this is likely to be an overestimate because of the current biased
distribution of flux measuring sites (Bolin et al., 2000).

"Most dead biomass enters the detritus and soil organic matter
pools where it is respired at a rate that depends on the chemical
composition of the dead tissues and on environmental conditions
(for example, low temperatures, dry conditions and flooding slow
down decomposition). Conceptually, several soil carbon pools
are distinguished. Detritus and microbial biomass have a short
turnover time (<10 yr). Modified soil organic carbon has decadal
to centennial turnover time. Inert (stable or recalcitrant) soil
organic carbon is composed of molecules more or less resistant
to further decomposition. A very small fraction of soil organic
matter, and a small fraction of burnt biomass, are converted into
inert forms (Schlesinger, 1990; Kuhlbusch et al., 1996). Natural
processes and management regimes may reduce or increase the
amount of carbon stored in pools with turnover times on the order
of tens to hundreds of years (living wood, wood products and
modified soil organic matter) and thus influence the time
evolution of atmospheric CO, over the century.

Higher plants acquire CO, by diffusion through tiny pores
(stomata) into leaves and thus to the sites of photosynthesis. The
total amount of CO, that dissolves in leaf water amounts to
about 270 PgC/yr, i.e., more than one-third of all the CO, in the
atmosphere (Farquhar et al., 1993; Ciais et al., 1997). This
quantity is measurable because this CO, has time to exchange
oxygen atoms with the leaf water and is imprinted with the
corresponding '8O “signature” (Francey and Tans, 1987;
Farquhar et al., 1993). Most of this CO, diffuses out again
without participating in photosynthesis. The amount that is
“fixed” from the atmosphere, i.e., converted from CO, to
carbohydrate during photosynthesis, is known as gross primary
production (GPP). Terrestrial GPP has been estimated as about
120 PgC/yr based on '80 measurements of atmospheric CO
(Ciais et al., 1997). This is also the approximate value necessary
to support observed plant growth, assuming that about half of
GPP is incorporated into new plant tissues such as leaves, roots
and wood, and the other half is converted back to atmospheric
CO, by autotrophic respiration (respiration by plant tissues)
(Lloyd and Farquhar, 1996; Waring et al., 1998).

"Rough upper bounds for the impact of reforestation on atmospheric CO, concentration over a century time-scale can be calculated
as follows. Cumulative carbon losses to the atmosphere due to land-use change during the past | to 2 centuries are estimated as
180 to 200 PgC (de Fries et al., 1999) and cumulative fossil fuel emissions to year 2000 as 280 PgC (Marland et al., 2000), giving
cumulative anthropogenic emissions of 480 to 500 PgC. Atmospheric CO, content has increased by 90 ppm (190 PgC).
Approximately 40% of anthropogenic CO, emissions has thus remained in the atmosphere; the rest has been taken up by the land
and oceans in roughly equal proportions (see main text). Conversely, if land-use change were completely reversed over the 21st
century, a CO, reduction of 0.40 x 200 = 80 PgC (about 40 ppm) might be expected. This calculation assumes that future ecosys-

Land use responds to social and economic pressures to
provide food, fuel and wood products, for subsistence use or for
export. Land clearing can lead to soil degradation, erosion and
leaching of nutrients, and may therefore reduce the subsequent
ability of the ecosystem to act as a carbon sink (Taylor and Lloyd,
1992). Ecosystem conservation and management practices can
restore, maintain and enlarge carbon stocks (IPCC, 2000a). Fire
is important in the carbon budget of some ecosystems (e.g.,
boreal forests, grasslands, tropical savannas and woodlands) and
is affected directly by management and indirectly by land-use
change (Apps et al., 1993). Fire is a major short-term source of
carbon, but adds to a small longer-term sink (<0.1 PgC/yr)
through production of slowly decomposing and inert black
carbon.

The terrestrial system is currently acting as a global sink for
carbon (Table 3.1) despite large releases of carbon due to
deforestation in some regions. Likely mechanisms for the sink
are known, but their relative contribution is uncertain. Natural
climate variability and disturbance regimes (including fire and
herbivory) affect NBP through their impacts on NPP, allocation
to long- versus short-lived tissues, chemical and physical proper-
ties of litter, stocks of living biomass, stocks of detritus and soil
carbon, environmental controls on decomposition and rates of
biomass removal. Human impacts occur through changes in land
use and land management, and through indirect mechanisms
including climate change, and fertilisation due to elevated CO,
and deposition of nutrients (most importantly, reactive nitrogen).
These mechanisms are discussed individually in the following
sections.

Changes in land use and management affect the amount of

carbon in plant biomass and soils. Historical cumulative carbon
losses due to changes in land use have been estimated to be 180
to 200 PgC by comparing maps of “natural” vegetation in the
absence of human disturbance (derived from ground-based
information (Matthews, 1983) or from modelled potential vegeta-
tion based on climate (Leemans, 1990)) to a map of current
vegetation derived from 1987 satellite data (de Fries et al., 1999).
Houghton (1999, 2000) estimated emissions of 121 PgC (approx-
imately 60% in tropical areas and 40% in temperate areas) for the
period 1850 to 1990 from statistics on land-use change, and a
simple model tracking rates of decomposition from different
pools and rates of regrowth on abandoned or reforested land.
There was substantial deforestation in temperate areas prior to
1850, and this may be partially reflected in the difference
between these two analyses. The estimated land-use emissions
during 1850 to 1990 of 121 PgC (Houghton, 1999, 2000) can be
compared to estimated net terrestrial flux of 39 PgC to the
atmosphere over the same period inferred from an atmospheric

"By definition, for an ecosystem in steady state, Rh and other
carbon losses would just balance NPP, and NBP would be zero.
In reality, human activities, natural disturbances and climate
variability alter NPP and Rh, causing transient changes in the
terrestrial carbon pool and thus non-zero NBP. If the rate of
carbon input (NPP) changes, the rate of carbon output (Rh) also
changes, in proportion to the altered carbon content; but there is
a time lag between changes in NPP and changes in the slower
responding carbon pools. For a step increase in NPP, NBP is
expected to increase at first but to relax towards zero over a
period of years to decades as the respiring pool “catches up”.
The globally averaged lag required for Rh to catch up with a
change in NPP has been estimated to be of the order of 10 to 30
years (Raich and Schlesinger, 1992). A continuous increase in
NPP is expected to produce a sustained positive NBP, so long as
NPP is still increasing, so that the increased terrestrial carbon
has not been processed through the respiring carbon pools
(Taylor and Lloyd, 1992; Friedlingstein et al., 1995a; Thompson
et al., 1996; Kicklighter et al., 1999), and provided that the
increase is not outweighed by compensating increases in

"Deforestation has been responsible for almost 90% of the
estimated emissions due to land-use change since 1850, with a
20% decrease of the global forest area (Houghton, 1999).
Deforestation appears to be slowing slightly in tropical countries
(FAO, 1997; Houghton, 2000), and some deforested areas in
Europe and North America have been reforested in recent
decades (FAO, 1997). Managed or regenerated forests generally
store less carbon than natural forests, even at maturity. New trees
take up carbon rapidly, but this slows down towards maturity
when forests can be slight sources or sinks (Buchmann and
Schulze, 1999). To use land continuously in order to take up
carbon, the wood must be harvested and turned into long-lived
products and trees must be re-planted. The trees may also be used
for biomass energy to avoid future fossil fuel emissions (Hall et
al., 2000). Analysis of scenarios for future development show

Draining peatlands for agriculture increases total carbon released

"The climatic sensitivity of high northern latitude ecosystems
(tundra and taiga) has received particular attention as a
consequence of their expanse, high carbon density, and observa-
tions of disproportionate warming in these regions (Chapman and
Walsh, 1993; Overpeck et al., 1997). High-latitude ecosystems
contain about 25% of the total world soil carbon pool in the
permafrost and the seasonally-thawed soil layer. This carbon
storage may be affected by changes in temperature and water
table depth. High latitude ecosystems have low NPP, in part due
to short growing seasons, and slow nutrient cycling because of
low rates of decomposition in waterlogged and cold soils.
Remotely sensed data (Myneni et al., 1997) and phenological
observations (Menzel and Fabian, 1999) independently indicate a
recent trend to longer growing seasons in the boreal zone and
temperate Europe. Such a trend might be expected to have
increased annual NPP. A shift towards earlier and stronger spring
depletion of atmospheric CO, has also been observed at northern
stations, consistent with earlier onset of growth at mid- to high
northern latitudes (Manning, 1992; Keeling et al., 1996a;

individual high-latitude sites have generally failed to find

reflect terrestrial biosphere responses to climate variability
(Section 3.5.3). Warming may increase NPP in temperate and
arctic ecosystems where it can increase the length of the seasonal
and daily growing cycles, but it may decrease NPP in water-
stressed ecosystems as it increases water loss. Respiratory
processes are sensitive to temperature; soil and root respiration
have generally been shown to increase with warming in the short
term (Lloyd and Taylor, 1994; Boone et al., 1998) although
evidence on longer-term impacts is conflicting (Trumbore, 2000;
Giardina and Ryan, 2000; Jarvis and Linder, 2000). Changes in
rainfall pattern affect plant water availability and the length of the
growing season, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. Cloud
cover can be beneficial to NPP in dry areas with high solar
radiation, but detrimental in areas with low solar radiation.
Changing climate can also affect the distribution of plants and the
incidence of disturbances such as fire (which could increase or
decrease depending on warming and precipitation patterns,
possibly resulting under some circumstances in rapid losses of
carbon), wind, and insect and pathogen attacks, leading to
changes in NBP. The global balance of these positive and
negative effects of climate on NBP depends strongly on regional

The process of CO) “fertilisation” thus involves direct effects
on carbon assimilation and indirect effects such as those via
water saving and interactions between the carbon and nitrogen
cycles. Increasing CO, can therefore lead to structural and
physiological changes in plants (Pritchard et al., 1999) and can
further affect plant competition and distribution patterns due to
responses of different species. Field studies show that the relative
stimulation of NPP tends to be greater in low-productivity years,
suggesting that improvements in water- and nutrient-use
efficiency can be more important than direct NPP stimulation

CO, and O, compete for the reaction sites on the photosynthetic
carbon-fixing enzyme, Rubisco. Increasing the concentration of
CO, in the atmosphere has two effects on the Rubisco reactions:
increasing the rate of reaction with CO, (carboxylation) and
decreasing the rate of oxygenation. Both effects increase the
rate of photosynthesis, since oxygenation is followed by
photorespiration which releases CO, (Farquhar ef al., 1980).
With increased photsynthesis, plants can develop faster,
attaining the same final size in less time, or can increase their
final mass. In the first case, the overall rate of litter production
increases and so the soil carbon stock increases; in the second
case, both the below-ground and above-ground carbon stocks
increase. Both types of growth response to elevated CO, have

The strength of the response of photosynthesis to an
increase in CO, concentration depends on the photosynthetic
pathway used by the plant. Plants with a photosynthetic
pathway known as C; (all trees, nearly all plants of cold

generally show an increased rate of photosynthesis in response
to increases in CO) concentration above the present level (Koch

with the C, photosynthetic pathway (tropical and many
temperate grasses, some desert shrubs, and some crops
including maize and sugar cane) already have a mechanism to
concentrate CO, and therefore show either no direct photo-
synthetic response, or less response than C; plants (Wand et al.,

respiration under some conditions (Drake et al., 1999),

Because the soil microbial community is generally limited by

"Nitrogen availability is an important constraint on NPP

into the atmosphere in the form of nitrogen oxides (NO,) during
fossil fuel and biomass combustion and ammonia emitted by
industrial regions, animal husbandry and fertiliser use (Chapter
4). This nitrogen is then deposited fairly near to the source, and
can act as a fertiliser for terrestrial plants. There has been a
rapid increase in reactive nitrogen deposition over the last 150
years (Vitousek er al., 1997; Holland et al., 1999). Much field
evidence on nitrogen fertilisation effects on plants (e.g.,

result in increased NPP, including the growth of trees in Europe

The annual two-way gross exchange of CO, between the

molecular diffusion across the air-sea interface. Net CO,
transfer can occur whenever there is a partial pressure differ-
ence of CO, across this interface. The flux can be estimated as
the product of a gas transfer coefficient, the solubility of CO>,
and the partial pressure difference of CO, between air and
water. The gas transfer coefficient incorporates effects of many
physical factors but is usually expressed as a non-linear
function of wind speed alone. There is considerable uncertainty
about this function (Liss and Merlivat, 1986; Wanninkhof,
1992; Watson ef al., 1995). Improvements in the ability to

carbonate (CaCO3) that sink vertically or accumulate in
sediments, coral reefs and sands. This process depletes surface
CO;7-, reduces alkalinity, and tends to increase pCO, and drive
more outgassing of CO, (see Box 3.3 and Figure 3.1). The
effect of CaCO; formation on surface water pCO, and air-sea
fluxes is therefore counter to the effect of organic carbon
production. For the surface ocean globally, the ratio between
the export of organic carbon and the export of calcium
carbonate (the “rain ratio”) is a critical factor controlling the
overall effect of biological activity on surface ocean pCO,
(Figure 3.1; Archer and Maier-Reimer, 1994). Milliman (1993)
estimated a global production of CaCO; of 0.7 PgC/yr, with
roughly equivalent amounts produced in shallow water and
surface waters of the deep ocean. Of this total, approximately
60% accumulates in sediments. The rest re-dissolves either in
the water column or within the sediment. An estimate of CaCO;
flux analogous to the export production of organic carbon,
however, should include sinking out of the upper layers of the
open ocean, net accumulation in shallow sediments and reefs,
and export of material from shallow systems into deep sea
environments. Based on Milliman’s (1993) budget, this quantity
is about 0.6 PgC/yr (+ 25 to 50 % at least). The global average
rain ratio has been variously estimated from models of varying
complexity to be 4 (Broecker and Peng, 1982), 3.5 to 7.5
(Shaffer, 1993), and 11 (Yamanaka and Tajika, 1996). (It should
be noted that rain ratios are highly depth dependent due to rapid
oxidation of organic carbon at shallow depth compared to the

1996; Falkowski et al., 1998; Field er al., 1998; Balkanski er al.,
1999). About 14 to 30% of the total NPP occurs in coastal areas
(Gattuso et al., 1998). The resulting organic carbon is
consumed by zooplankton (a quantitatively more important
process than herbivory on land) or becomes detritus. Some
organic carbon is released in dissolved form (DOC) and
oxidised by bacteria (Ducklow, 1999) with a fraction entering
the ocean reservoir as net DOC production (Hansell and
Carlson, 1998). Sinking of particulate organic carbon (POC)
composed of dead organisms and detritus together with vertical
transfer of DOC create a downward flux of organic carbon from
the upper ocean known as “export production”. Recent
estimates for global export production range from roughly 10 to
20 PgC/yr (Falkowski et al., 1998; Laws et al., 2000). An
alternative estimate for global export production of 11 PgC/yr
has been derived using an inverse model of physical and
chemical data from the world’s oceans (Schlitzer, 2000). Only
a small fraction (about 0.1 PgC) of the export production sinks
in sediments, mostly in the coastal ocean (Gattuso et al., 1998).
Heterotrophic respiration at depth converts the remaining
organic carbon back to DIC. Eventually, and usually at another
location, this DIC is upwelled into the ocean’s surface layer
again and may re-equilibrate with the atmospheric CO,. These
mechanisms, often referred to as the biological pump, maintain
higher DIC concentrations at depth and cause atmospheric CO,
concentrations to be about 200 ppm lower than would be the
case in the absence of such mechanisms (Sarmiento and
Toggweiler, 1984; Maier-Reimer et al., 1996).

"The overall productivity of the ocean is determined largely
by nutrient supply from deep water. There are multiple
potentially limiting nutrients: in practice nitrate and/or
phosphate are commonly limiting (Falkowski et al., 1998;
Tyrell, 1999). Silicate plays a role in limiting specific types of
phytoplankton and hence in determining the qualitative nature
of primary production, and potentially the depth to which
organic carbon sinks. A role for iron in limiting primary produc-
tivity in regions with detectable phosphate and nitrate but low
productivity (HNLC or “high nutrient, low chlorophyll
regions”) has been experimentally demonstrated in the equato-
rial Pacific (Coale et al., 1996) and the Southern Ocean (Boyd
et al., 2000). In both regions artificial addition of iron
stimulated phytoplankton growth, resulting in decreased
surface-water pCO). In HLNC regions, the supply of iron from
deep water, while an important source, is generally insufficient
to meet the requirements of phytoplankton. An important
additional supply of iron to surface waters far removed from
sediment and riverine sources is aeolian transport and deposi-
tion (Duce and Tindale, 1991; Fung et al., 2000; Martin, 1990).
This aeolian supply of iron may limit primary production in
HNLC regions, although the effect is ultimately constrained by
the availability of nitrate and phosphate. Iron has been hypoth-
esised to play an indirect role over longer time-scales (e.g.,
glacial-interglacial) through limitation of oceanic nitrogen
fixation and, consequently, the oceanic content of nitrate
(Falkowski et al., 1998; Broecker and Henderson, 1998; Box
3.4). The regional variability of oceanic nitrogen fixation
(Gruber and Sarmiento, 1997) and its temporal variability and
potential climate-sensitivity have recently become apparent
based on results from long time-series and global surveys (Karl
et al., 1997; Hansell and Feely, 2000).

implying that anthropogenic CO, uptake is limited by the rate at
which “older” waters are mixed towards the air-sea interface. The
rate of exposure of older, deeper waters is therefore a critical
factor limiting the uptake of anthropogenic CO. In principle,
there is sufficient uptake capacity (see Box 3.3) in the ocean to
incorporate 70 to 80% of anthropogenic CO, emissions to the
atmosphere, even when total emissions of up to 4,500 PgC are
considered (Archer et al., 1997). The finite rate of ocean mixing,
however, means that it takes several hundred years to access this
capacity (Maier-Reimer and Hasselmann, 1987; Enting er al.,
1994; Archer et al., 1997). Chemical neutralisation of added CO,
through reaction with CaCO; contained in deep ocean sediments
could potentially absorb a further 9 to 15% of the total emitted
amount, reducing the airborne fraction of cumulative emissions by
about a factor of 2; however the response time of deep ocean
sediments is in the order of 5,000 years (Archer et al., 1997).

Using time-series and ‘global survey data, “the increasing
oceanic carbon content has been directly observed, although the
signal is small compared to natural variability and requires
extremely accurate measurements (Sabine et al., 1997). A long-
term increase of surface water CO), levels tracking the mean
atmospheric CO, increase has been observed in the ocean’s
subtropical gyres (Bates et al., 1996; Winn et al., 1998) and the
equatorial Pacific (Feely et al., 1999b). However, very few such
time-series exist and the response of other important oceanic
regions to the atmospheric pCO) increase cannot yet be assessed.
Inter-decadal increases in DIC concentrations at depth have been
resolved from direct measurements (Wallace, 1995; Peng et al.,
1998; Ono et al., 1998; Sabine et al., 1999). The total amounts of
anthropogenic CO, accumulated in the ocean since the pre-
industrial era can also be estimated from measurements using
recent refinements (Gruber et al., 1996) of long-standing methods
for separating the natural and anthropogenic components of
oceanic DIC. A comparison of such analyses with ocean model
results is presented in Section 3.6.3.

The increase of atmospheric pCO, over pre-industrial levels
has tended to increase uptake into natural CO) sink regions and
decreased release from natural outgassing regions. Contemporary
net air-sea fluxes comprise spatially-varying mixtures of natural
and anthropogenic CO, flux components and cannot be equated
with anthropogenic CO, uptake, except on a global scale. Uptake
of anthropogenic CO) is strongest in regions where “old” waters,
which have spent many years in the ocean interior since their last
contact with the atmosphere, are re-exposed at the sea surface to a
contemporary atmosphere which now contains anthropogenic
CO, (e.g., Sarmiento et al., 1992; Doney, 1999). In an upwelling
region, for example, the natural component of the air-sea flux may
be to outgas CO, to the atmosphere. The higher atmospheric pCO,
of the contemporary atmosphere acts to reduce this outgassing
relative to the natural state, implying that more carbon remains in
the ocean. This represents uptake of anthropogenic CO, by a
region which is a source of CO, to the atmosphere. The additional
carbon in the ocean resulting from such uptake is then transported
by the surface ocean circulation, and eventually stored as surface
waters sink, or are mixed, into the deep ocean interior. Whereas
upwelling into the surface layer is quantitatively balanced on a
global scale by sinking, the locations where deep waters rise and
sink can be separated by large horizontal distances.

Despite the importance of biological processes for the ocean’s
natural carbon cycle, current thinking maintains that the oceanic
uptake of anthropogenic CO, is primarily a physically and
chemically controlled process superimposed on a biologically
driven carbon cycle that is close to steady state. This differs from
the situation on land because of the different factors which control
marine and terrestrial primary productivity. On land, experiments
have repeatedly shown that current CO, concentrations are
limiting to plant growth (Section 3.2.2.4). In the ocean, experi-
mental evidence is against control of productivity by CO) concen-
trations, except for certain species at lower than contemporary
CO, concentrations (Riebesell et al., 1993; Falkowski, 1994).
Further, deep ocean concentrations of major nutrients and DIC are
tightly correlated, with the existing ratios closely (but not exactly,
see Section 3.2.3.3) matching the nutritional requirements of
marine organisms (the “Redfield ratios”: Redfield et al., 1963).
This implies that as long as nutrients that are mixed into the ocean
surface layer are largely removed by organic carbon production
and export, then there is little potential to drive a net air-sea carbon
transfer simply through alteration of the global rate of production.
Terrestrial ecosystems show greater variability in this respect
because land plants have multiple ways to acquire nutrients, and
have greater plasticity in their chemical composition (Melillo and
Gosz, 1983). There are, however, extensive regions of the ocean
surface where major nutrients are not fully depleted, and changes
in these regions may play a significant role in altering atmosphere-

ocean carbon partitioning (see Section 3.2.3.3).

Qualitative and quantitative changes in carbon uptake arising from
changes in marine ecosystems are more speculative (Denman et
al., 1996; Falkowski et al., 1998; Watson and Liss, 1998), but are
likely to have occurred over glacial-interglacial time-scales
(Section 3.3). Falkowski et al. (1998) listed three major classes of
biologically linked factors that can in principal alter the air-sea
partitioning of CO,: (1) changes in surface nutrient utilisation
(e.g., in HNLC areas); (2) changes in total ocean content of major
nutrients; (3) changes in the elemental composition of biogenic
material (including the rain ratio). Our incomplete understanding
of present day nutrient controls on productivity limits our ability
to predict future changes in ocean biology and their effect on CO,
levels. For example, the possible identification of changes in deep
ocean C:N:P ratios (Pahlow and Riebesell, 2000) leaves open the
question of the extent to which ocean biological carbon cycling is
in steady state, or is likely to remain so in the future.

Changes in surface nutrient utilisation. Changes in the utilisa-
tion of surface nutrients in HNLC regions have the potential to
alter export production and carbon storage in the ocean interior.
Most attention focuses on the role of inadvertent or deliberate
changes in the external supply of iron to such regions. The sign of
possible future responses of ocean biota due to iron supply
changes is difficult to assess. Future iron supply may increase due
to erosion (enhanced by agriculture and urbanisation) which tends
to increase dust export and aeolian iron deposition (Tegen and
Fung, 1995). Conversely, a globally enhanced hydrological cycle
and increased water-use efficiency of terrestrial plants may tend to
reduce future dust export (Harrison et al., 2001). The delivery of
dust to the HNLC regions will be sensitive to regional changes in
erosion and the hydrological cycle, affecting the important regions
of dust export, rather than to global scale changes (Dai et al.,
1998).

"Changes in total ocean content of major nutrients. Changes in
the delivery of the major biologically limiting nutrients (N, P, Fe,
Si) from riverine, atmospheric or sedimentary sources, or changes
in removal rates (e.g., denitrification), could alter oceanic nutrient
inventories and hence export production and ocean carbon
storage. On the global scale, the upward fluxes of major nutrients
are slightly depleted in N relative to P with respect to the nutrient
requirements of phytoplankton (Fanning, 1992). This relative
supply of N versus P may be sensitive to climate and circulation
related changes in the rate of fixed-nitrogen removal by denitrifi-
cation (Ganeshram ef al., 1995) or via changes in the rate of
nitrogen fixation. Changes in river flow and composition are also
affecting the supply of nutrients (Frankignoulle et al., 1998). The
hypothesised link between nitrogen fixation in certain ocean
regions and the external iron supply (Falkowski, 1997; Wu et al.,
2000) could play a role in future nutrient and carbon budgets.
Nitrogen fixation rates may also be affected by changes in strati-
fication and mixing. For example, Karl et al. (1997) have identi-
fied interannual variability in nitrogen fixation rates in the sub-
tropical Pacific which are apparently linked to ENSO variability
in upper ocean dynamics.

"Changes in the elemental composition of biogenic material.
The structure and biogeochemistry of marine ecosystems can be
affected by numerous climate-related factors including tempera-
ture, cloudiness, nutrient availability, mixed-layer physics and
sea-ice extent. In turn the structure of marine ecosystems, and
particularly the species composition of phytoplankton, exert a
control on the partitioning of carbon between the ocean and the
atmosphere. For example, a change in distribution of calcareous
versus siliceous planktonic organisms could affect CO, uptake in
the future, as it may have done in the past (Archer and Maier-
Reimer, 1994). Precipitation of CaCO; by marine organisms
(calcification) removes dissolved CO,7-, thus decreasing surface
water alkalinity and reducing the capacity of sea water to dissolve
atmospheric CO, (see Box 3.3). Recent experimental evidence
suggests that as a direct result of increasing atmospheric and
surface water pCO) levels, oceanic calcification will decrease
significantly over the next 100 years. Model-based calculations
suggest that decreases in coral reef calcification rates of the order
17 to 35% relative to pre-industrial rates are possible (Kleypas et
al., 1999). Experimental studies with corals have confirmed such
effects (Langdon er al., 2000). Field and laboratory studies have
shown that planktonic calcification is also highly sensitive to
pCO, levels. The calcification rate of coccolithophorids decreases
by 16 to 83% at pCO, levels of 750 ppm (Riebesell et al., 2000).
Such an effect would tend to favour CO, storage in the upper
ocean and act as a negative feedback on atmospheric growth rates
of CO;. However, long-term predictions of such biological
responses are hampered by a lack of understanding concerning
physiological acclimation and genetic adaptations of species to
increasing pCO3.

It is pertinent, however, that photosynthesis evolved at a time
when O, concentrations were far less than at present. O, has
accumulated in the atmosphere over geological time because
photosynthesis results in the burial of reduced chemical species:
pyrite (FeS,) derived from sulphur-reducing bacteria, and organic
carbon. This accumulation has consequences for terrestrial and
marine ecosystems today. Primary production is carbon limited in
terrestrial ecosystems in part because of (geologically speaking)
low CO, concentrations, and in part because Rubisco (the enzyme
that fixes CO, in all plants) also has an affinity for O that reduces
its efficiency in photosynthesis (see Section 3.2.2.4). Primary
production is iron limited in some marine ecosystems mainly
because of the extreme insolubility of Fe(IID), the predominant
form of iron in the present, O>-rich environment. These difficulties
faced by contemporary organisms represent a legacy of earlier
evolution under very different biogeochemical conditions.

"One family of hypotheses to explain glacial/inter-glacial variations of atmospheric CO, relies on physical mechanisms that could
change the dissolution and outgassing of CO) in the ocean. The solubility of CO) is increased at low temperature, but reduced at
high salinity. These effects nearly cancel out over the glacial/inter-glacial cycle, so simple solubility changes are not the answer.
Stephens and Keeling (2000) have proposed that extended winter sea ice prevented outgassing of upwelled, CO,-rich water around
the Antarctic continent during glacial times. A melt-water “cap” may have further restricted outgassing of CO, during summer
(Frangois et al., 1997). These mechanisms could explain the parallel increases of Antarctic temperature and CO, during deglacia-

and low latitudes for the transport of CO, by physical processes is not well known, and may be poorly represented in most ocean

Several authors have hypothesised increased utilisation of surface nutrients by marine ecosystems in high latitudes, leading to
stronger vertical gradients of DIC and thus reduced atmospheric CO, during glacial times (Sarmiento and Toggweiler, 1984;
Siegenthaler and Wenk, 1984; Knox and McElroy, 1984). Other hypotheses call for an increased external supply of nutrients to the
ocean (McElroy, 1983; Martin et al., 1990; Broecker and Henderson, 1998). The supply of iron-rich dust to the Southern Ocean is
increased during glacial periods, due to expanded deserts in the Patagonian source region (Andersen et al., 1998; Mahowald et al.,
1999; Petit et al., 1999); dust-borne iron concentration in Antarctic ice is also increased (Edwards ef al., 1998). Fertilisation of
marine productivity by iron from this source could have influenced atmospheric CO}. Most of these mechanisms, however, can only
account for about 30 ppm, or less, of the change (Lefévre and Watson, 1999; Archer and Johnson, 2000). Palaeo-nutrient proxies
have also been used to argue against large changes in total high latitude productivity (Boyle, 1988; Rickaby and Elderfield, 1999;
Elderfield and Rickaby, 2000), even if the region of high productivity in the Southern Ocean may have been shifted to the north
(Kumar et al., 1995; Francois et al., 1997). Increased productivity over larger regions might have been caused by decreased denitri-
fication (Altabet er al., 1995; Ganeshram et al., 1995) or iron stimulated N, fixation (Broecker and Henderson, 1998) leading to an
increase in the total ocean content of reactive nitrogen.

Changes during the present inter-glacial (until the start of the

Although complete explanations for these changes in the past

Atmospheric CO, concentrations have also been reconstructed
indirectly, from stomatal index measurements on sub-fossil leaves
(Van de Water et al., 1994; Beerling ef al., 1995; Rundgren and
Beerling, 1999; Wagner et al. 1999). Stomatal density and
stomatal index of many species respond to atmospheric CO,
(Woodward, 1987; Woodward and Bazzaz, 1988) but are
influenced by other environmental variables as well (Poole et al.,
1996). One recent stomatal index record, interpreted as implying
high (up to 350 ppm) and rapidly fluctuating CO, concentrations
in the early Holocene (Wagner et al., 1999), is clearly incompat-
ible with the ice core record of Indermiihle er al. (1999), whereas
a continuous stomatal index record from 9 kyr BP onwards
(Rundgren and Beerling, 1999) has shown concentration trends
consistent with the ice-core records.

"Orbital variations (Berger, 1978) are the pacemaker of climate
change on multi-millenial time-scales (Hays et al., 1976).
Atmospheric CO, is one of many Earth system variables that
show the characteristic “Milankovitch” periodicities, and has been
implicated as a key factor in locking natural climate changes to the
100 kyr eccentricity cycle (Shackleton, 2000). Whatever the
mechanisms involved, lags of up to 2,000 to 4,000 years in the
drawdown of CO), at the start of glacial periods suggests that the
low CO, concentrations during glacial periods amplify the climate
change but do not initiate glaciations (Lorius and Oeschger, 1994;
Fischer et al., 1999). Once established, the low CO, concentration
is likely to have enhanced global cooling (Hewitt and Mitchell,
1997). During the last deglaciation, rising CO, paralleled
Southern Hemisphere warming and was ahead of Northern
Hemisphere warming (Chapter 2).

"The terrestrial biosphere stores 300 to 700 Pg more carbon
during interglacial periods than during glacial periods, based on a
widely accepted interpretation of the 8C record in deep-sea

Terrestrial modelling studies (e.g., Friedlingstein et al., 1995b;
Peng et al., 1998) have reached the same conclusion. Thus, the
terrestrial biosphere does not cause the difference in atmospheric
CO, between glacial and interglacial periods. The cause must lie
in the ocean, and indeed the amount of atmospheric change to be
accounted for must be augmented to account for a fraction of the
carbon transferred between the land and ocean. The mechanism
remains controversial (see Box 3.4). In part this is because a
variety of processes that could be effective in altering CO} levels
ona century time-scale can be largely cancelled on multi-millenial
time-scales by changes in CaCO; sedimentation or dissolution, as
discussed in Section 3.2.3.1.

show a short-lived maximum around 11 kyr BP, followed by a
slight fall, which may have been caused by increasing carbon

During glacial periods, the atmospheric CO, concentration
does not track the “fast” changes in climate (e.g., decade to
century scale warming events) associated with Dansgaard-
Oeschger events, although there are CO, fluctuations of up to 20
ppm associated with the longer-lived events (Stauffer et al., 1998;
Indermiihle et al., 2000) (see Chapter 2 for explanations of these
terms). During the last deglaciation, atmospheric CO, concentra-
tion continued to increase, by about 12 ppm, through the Younger
Dryas cold reversal (12.7 to 11.6 kyr BP) seen in Northern
Hemisphere palaeoclimate records (Fischer et al., 1999; Smith et
al., 1999). Palaeo-oceanographic evidence shows that the Younger
Dryas event was marked by a prolonged shut-down of the thermo-
haline circulation, which is likely to have been triggered by the
release of melt water into the North Atlantic. Similar behaviour,
with a slight rise in CO, accompanying a major Northern
Hemisphere cooling and shutdown of North Atlantic Deep Water
production, has been produced in a coupled atmosphere-ocean
model (Marchal et al., 1998). The observed CO, rise during the
Younger Dryas period was modest, suggesting that atmospheric
CO, has, under natural conditions, been well buffered against
abrupt changes in climate, including thermohaline collapse. This
buffering is a direct consequence of the large reservoir of DIC in
the ocean.

Houghton and Hackler’s (1995) earlier estimate of 1.6 PgC/yr

reanalysis of data from tropical Asia (Houghton and Hackler,

reduce the estimated emissions from the Brazilian Amazon by
half (Houghton et al., 2000), and point to other previously
unaccounted for sinks of carbon in the USA such as fire

management of agricultural soils (Houghton et al., 1999).
Consideration of these additional studies brings the overall total

Estimates of annual global emissions from fossil fuel
burning and cement production by Marland et al. (2000) span
the period from 1751 through to 1997, reaching a maximum in
1997 of 6.6 PgC/yr (0.2 PgC/yr of this was from cement
production). The primary data for these estimates are annual
energy statistics compiled by the United Nations (2000).
Emissions for 1998 and 1999 have been estimated based on
energy statistics compiled by British Petroleum (2000).
Emission factors (IPCC, 1997) were applied to consumption
statistics (British Petroleum, 2000) to calculate emissions over
the period 1990 to 1999. Emissions were then scaled to match
the estimates for emissions from fossil fuel burning and cement
production from Marland et al. (2000) over the overlap period
from 1990 to 1997. The scaled emission estimates, therefore,
implicitly include emissions from cement production.

"An independent analysis (see Section 3.6.2.2) by the Carbon
Cycle Model Linkage Project (CCMLP) also calculated the
marginal effects of land-use changes on the global terrestrial
carbon budget (McGuire ef al., 2001). Land-use change data
(conversions between native vegetation and crops) were derived
from Ramankutty and Foley (2000). The estimates obtained for
net land-use flux during the 1980s were between 0.6 and 1.0
PgC/yr, i.e., substantially smaller than the fluxes calculated by
Houghton (1999). The reasons for this discrepancy are unclear.
The CCMLP estimates may be too low because they neglected
conversions to pasture. However, data presented in Houghton
(1999) indicate that the main changes during recent decades
were due to land conversion for crops. A more important differ-

Measurement of changes in O) presents a technical challenge because changes of a few ppm caused by fossil fuel burning have
to be determined against a background concentration of 209,000 ppm (about 21%). For technical reasons, O, is measured relative
to N>, the main constituent of the atmosphere, as a reference gas. For simplicity this chapter refers to O2 concentrations, although
strictly it is O2 : N> ratios that are measured. The impact of nitrification-denitrification changes on atmospheric N> content are
assumed not to be problematic because they are small and the inventory of N, is very large. Increases in ocean temperatures (Levitus
et al., 2000), because of their effect on the temperature dependent solubility, induce small outgassing fluxes of O7 and N; (Keeling
et al., 1993) that have to be taken into account (see Figure 3.4) although their magnitude is only approximately known. Impacts on
atmospheric O, caused by changes in the ventilation of deeper, oxygen depleted waters have been observed on interannual time-
scales (Keeling et al., 1993, Bender et al., 1996). They could also occur on longer time-scales, e.g., through increased ocean strati-

"The amount of CO, that remains in the atmosphere each year has been consistently less than the amount emitted by fossil fuel
burning. This is because some CO) dissolves and mixes in the ocean, and some is taken up by the land. These two modes of uptake
have different effects on the concentration of O, in the atmosphere. Fossil fuel burning consumes O, and causes a decline in
atmospheric O, concentration (Figure 3.4). Dissolution of CO) in the ocean has no effect on atmospheric O). Terrestrial uptake of
CO;, by contrast, implies that photosynthesis (which releases O2) is exceeding respiration and other oxidation processes, including
fire (which consume O3). Thus, net terrestrial uptake of CO) implies a net release of O, in a known stochiometric ratio. This differ-
ence can be used to partition the total CO, uptake into land and ocean components, as shown graphically in Figure 3.4. Strictly
speaking, the atmospheric O, — CO, budget method can only distinguish between net non-biological ocean uptake and net
biospheric uptake, which in principle includes both the terrestrial and the marine biosphere. However, since biological oxygen
uptake is not expected to have changed significantly during recent decades because of nutrient limitations in most parts of the ocean

et al., 1989; Francey et al., 1995; Keeling et al., 1995). The principle of using 6'°C to separate land and ocean components of the
carbon budget relies on the fractionation during photosynthesis by C; plants, which discriminates against °C. This fractionation
leads to biospheric carbon being depleted in '°C by about 18%o relative to the atmosphere. In contrast, exchanges with the ocean
involve relatively small fractionation effects. Changes in the 'C/!?C ratio of atmospheric CO, thus indicate the extent to which
concurrent CO, variations can be ascribed to variations in biospheric uptake. The calculation also requires specification of the
turnover times of carbon in the ocean and on land, because fossil fuel burning implies a continuous release of isotopically light
carbon to the atmosphere. This leads to a lowering of the atmospheric !3C/!?C isotope ratio, which takes years to centuries to work
its way through the carbon cycle (Keeling et al., 1980; Tans et al., 1993; Ciais et al., 1995a,b).

Several alternative approaches to estimating the ocean-
atmosphere and land-atmosphere fluxes of CO, are summarised
in Table 3.4. Alternative methods for estimating the global ocean-
atmosphere flux, based on surface-water pCO, measurements
and ocean 8!3C changes (Quay ef al., 1992; Tans er al., 1993,
Heimann and Maier-Reimer, 1996; Sonnerup er al., 1999),
respectively, have yielded a range of —1.5 to —2.8 PgC/yr (for
various recent periods). The total anthropogenic CO, added to the
ocean since pre-industrial times can also be estimated indirectly
using oceanic observations (Gruber et al., 1996). A global value
of 107 + 27 PgC by 1990 can be estimated from the basin-scale
values of 40 + 9 PgC for the Atlantic in the 1980s (Gruber, 1998),
20 + 3 PgC for the Indian Ocean in 1995 (Sabine et al., 1999),
and the preliminary value of 45 PgC for the Pacific Ocean in
1990 to 1996 (Feely er al., 1999a) with a large uncertainty of the
order of + 15 PgC. Assuming that accumulation of CO) in the
ocean follows a curve similar to the (better known) accumulation
in the atmosphere, the value for the ocean-atmosphere flux for
1980 to 1989 would be between —1.6 and —2.7 PgC/yr. Although
each individual method has large uncertainty, all of these ocean-
based measurements give results comparable with the fluxes
presented in Table 3.1. Consideration of model-based estimates
of ocean uptake in Table 3.4 is deferred to Section 3.6.2.2.

"The rate of increase in the globally averaged atmospheric concen-

years have differed by 3 to 4 PgC/yr within a decade (Figure 3.3).
This variability cannot be accounted for by fossil fuel emissions,
which do not show short-term variability of this magnitude. The
explanation must lie in variability of the land-atmosphere flux or
the ocean-atmosphere flux or both. Variability in both systems
could be induced by climate variability.

"The land-atmosphere flux based on atmospheric measure-
ments represents the balance of a net land-use flux (currently a
positive flux, or carbon source, dominated by tropical deforesta-
tion) and a residual component which is, by inference, a negative
flux or carbon sink. Using the land-atmosphere flux estimates
from Table 3.1, assuming that land-use change contributed +1.7
PgC/yr to the atmosphere during the 1980s (Section 3.4.2), then
a residual terrestrial flux of —1.9 PgC/yr (i.e., a residual sink of
similar magnitude to the total ocean uptake) is required for mass
balance. This is the term popularly (and misleadingly) known as
the “missing sink”. The central estimate of its magnitude agrees
with previous analyses, e.g., in the SAR (if “northern forest
regrowth” is combined with “residual terrestrial sink” terms in
the SAR budget; Schimel et al., 1996) and the SRLULUCF
(Bolin et al., 2000) (Table 3.3). The uncertainty around this
number is rather large, however, because it compounds the
uncertainty in the atmospheric budget with a major uncertainty
about changes in land use. Using an error range corresponding
to 90% confidence intervals around the atmospheric estimate of
—0.2 PgC/yr (i.e., 1.66, giving confidence intervals of +1.1
PgC/yr), and taking the range of estimates for CO) released due
to land-use change during the 1980s from Section 3.4.2, the
residual terrestrial sink is estimated to range from —3.8 to +0.3
PgC/yr for the 1980s. Model-based analysis of the components of
the residual terrestrial sink (Table 3.4) is discussed in Section

largely been resolved during the 1990s (Francey et al., 1999a).
For the 1990s, a range of analyses using different atmospheric

a significant fraction of this Northern Hemisphere sink on land.

extremes of the ranges of values accepted for the two terms in this

(Europe, CIS, Japan and North America). An earlier review of
individual regional and national studies by Dixon et al. (1994),
highlighted in the IPCC WGII Second Assessment Report (IPCC,
996b; Brown et al., 1996), gave a range of —0.6 to —0.9 PgC/yr
or the land atmosphere flux in northern forests. While TBFRA-
2000 estimated biomass of woody vegetation only, the analyses
reviewed in Dixon et al. (1994) included other vegetation, soils,
itter and wood products. Under the United Nations Framework
Convention for Climate Change (UNFCCC) signatory countries
are required to report greenhouse gas emissions, including those
rom land-use change and forestry. Compilation of these data
implies a land-atmosphere flux of —0.6 PgC/yr for all Annex I
countries, and —0.6 PgC/yr for Annex I countries in the northern
latitudes only (UNFCCC, 2000). While the TBFRA synthesised

Process-based ocean models used in carbon cycle studies
include surface exchange of CO, with the atmosphere, carbon
chemistry, transport by physical processes in the ocean, and
transport by marine biology. The parametrization of marine
biology can be classified as (a) nutrient-based models where the
export of carbon below the surface ocean (approximately the top
50 m) is a function of surface nutrient concentration, (b) nutrient-
restoring models in which biological carbon fluxes are set to the
rates required for maintaining observed nutrient concentration

Process-based terrestrial models used in carbon cycle studies
are (a) terrestrial biogeochemical models (TBMs), which
simulate fluxes of carbon, water and nitrogen coupled within
terrestrial ecosystems, and (b) dynamic global vegetation models
(DGVMs), which further couple these processes interactively
with changes in ecosystem structure and composition (competi-
tion among different plant functional types; Prentice et al., 2000).
The treatment of carbon-nutrient interaction varies widely; for
example, some models treat nitrogen supply explicitly as a
constraint on NPP, while others do not. There are currently about
30 TBMs and <10 DGVMs. Cramer and Field (1999) and
Cramer et al. (2001) reported results from intercomparisons of
TBMs and DGVMs respectively. A current international project,
Ecosystem Model/Data Intercomparison (EMDI), aims to test
models of both types against a large set of terrestrial measure-
ments, in order to better constrain the modelled responses of
terrestrial carbon cycling to changes in CO, and climate.

A recent compilation of data from 478 permanent plots in
mature tropical moist forests throughout the tropics over at least
two decades found these were taking up carbon due to increasing
rates of tree growth. Extrapolation from these plots led to an
estimated land-atmosphere flux of (0.6 + 0.3 PgC/yr in Latin
America; growth trends in African and Asian forests were not
significantly different from zero (Phillips et al., 1998). This net
uptake is offset by emissions due to deforestation. Dixon et al.
(1994) estimated tropical forests overall to be a net source of
carbon with a land-atmosphere flux 1.7 + 0.4, based mostly on
FAO (1993b) inventory data and simple models of the effect of
land-use change (Houghton, 1995). It will not be possible to
assess trends and fluxes for the 1990s in the tropics from
inventory data until a full data set is available from the FAO
Global Forest Resources Assessment 2000. Among those
countries that have reported land-use emissions data to the
UNFCCC, there are significant discrepancies between the
primary data used in emissions inventories and the data available
in international surveys; for example, rates of deforestation differ
from rates reported by FAO (1993b) by as much as a factor of six
(Houghton and Ramakrishna, 1999).

"The results of globally aggregated forest inventories show a
greater uptake of carbon in forest growth than model-based
calculations of the marginal effects of land-use change (e.g.,
Houghton, 2000). Thus, inventory studies provide independent
evidence for the existence of a residual terrestrial sink; and they
show that a substantial part of this sink, at least, is located in
northern extratropical and tropical forests. Additional evidence
from individual inventory studies in mature forests that have not
undergone land-use changes shows that carbon stocks in such
forests are increasing (e.g., Lugo and Brown, 1993; Phillips et
al., 1998; Schulze et al., 1999). The difference between the
northern extra-tropical land-atmosphere flux of around —0.8
PgC/yr calculated by inventories (TBFRA-2000) and that of —
0.1 PgC/yr from land-use statistics (Houghton, 2000), both for
the early 1990s, implies a residual terrestrial sink on the order
of —0.7 PgC/yr in northern mid- and high latitudes. Combining
this with the estimated sink of —0.6 PgC/yr in mature tropical
moist forests (Phillips et al., 1998) makes it plausible that at
least a significant fraction of the current global terrestrial sink
(Table 3.1) could be explained by an increase of carbon stocks
in extant forests. The inventory-based estimate of land-
atmosphere flux in northern forests (-0.8 PgC/yr) is at the
positive end of the range calculated by inverse modelling studies
for the >30°N latitude band from 1990 to 1996 (—1.8 to —0.7
PgC/yr, Section 3.5.3), either because of biases in inverse
modelling that might tend to increase apparent uptake in the

et al., 1996; Heimann et al., 1997; Gérard et al., 1999; Ito and
Oikawa, 2000; Knorr, 2000; Prentice et al., 2000). This finding
supports the hypothesis (Section 3.5.2) that terrestrial effects
are important in determining the interannual variability of CO,
uptake. During typical El Nifio events, terrestrial model results
consistently show strongly reduced CO, uptake or CO) release
by the land. This result has been obtained with a range of
models, even when the models differ substantially in the
relative sensitivitivities of NPP and heterotrophic respiration to
temperature (Heimann et al., 1997; Knorr, 2000). The low CO
growth rate during the early 1990s has been simulated by some
terrestrial models (Prentice et al., 2000; Knorr, 2000).

"A more direct test of the simulated net exchange of CO,
between the terrestrial biosphere and the atmosphere is
provided by comparison with atmospheric CO, measurements
at remote monitoring sites. The comparison requires the use of
an atmospheric transport model to simulate CO, as a passive
tracer (Kaminski et al., 1996). The seasonal cycle of
atmospheric CO, shows a strong latitudinal pattern in
amplitude and phase, and is dominated by the terrestrial
biosphere (Heimann et al., 1998). The ability to simulate this
seasonal cycle thus constitutes a benchmark for terrestrial
models’ response to climate (Denning et al., 1996; Hunt et al.,
1996; Heimann et al., 1998; Nemry et al., 1999). Generally,
the observed seasonal cycles of CO) in northern and tropical
latitudes can be well simulated, with terrestrial models using
NDVI data as input (Knorr and Heimann, 1995), or by fully
prognostic models, including DGVMs (Prentice et al., 2000).

Time-dependent data sets for in situ comparisons are now
becoming available, thanks to eddy-covariance measurements
of CO, fluxes (Section 3.2.2.1; Box 3.1). Daily and seasonal
cycles of CO, and water fluxes provide a test of the coupling
between the carbon and hydrological cycles as simulated by
terrestrial models (Cienciala et al., 1998). Flux measurements
are now being carried out on a multi-annual basis at an
increasing number of stations, although global coverage
remains uneven, with the greatest concentration in Europe and
North America and few measurements from the tropics (see
Box 3.1). Field campaigns have started to retrieve flux data

Terrestrial models have also been evaluated at a global
scale by comparing simulated ecosystem water balance with
river runoff (e.g., Neilson and Marks, 1994; Foley et al., 1996;
Kucharik et al., 2000), and simulated seasonal leaf area with
satellite observations of “greenness”, often based on the
normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) (Field et al.,
1995b; de Fries et al., 1995). NDVI data can be translated into
estimates of the plant-absorbed fraction of incoming photo-
synthetically active radiation (FPAR) (Asrar et al, 1992),
which is related to leaf area index (LAI). The first terrestrial
model intercomparison showed differences among model
simulations of LAI and its seasonality (Bondeau et al., 1999).
More recently, it has been shown that constraining a terrestrial
model with remotely sensed spatial patterns of FPAR can lead
to a reduction of uncertainty in NPP simulations by about one
third (Knorr and Heimann, 2001b). Agreement with patterns of
remotely sensed FPAR has thus become a standard benchmark
for terrestrial models (Haxeltine and Prentice, 1996; Kucharik
et al., 2000) and attention has been focused on improving the
simulation of LAI and its seasonal variations.

There is no general agreement on how to model the linkage
between reactive nitrogen deposition and vegetation produc-
tivity, and recent model estimates of the additional effect of
anthropogenic nitrogen fertilisation on the global carbon cycle
vary widely. The anthropogenic nitrogen input itself (Holland er
al., 1999), the fate of anthropogenic nitrogen in the ecosystem
(Nadelhoffer et al., 1999; Jenkinson et al., 1999), and changes
in ecosystem nitrogen fixation (Vitousek and Field, 1999)
represent major sources of uncertainty. Estimates of the anthro-
pogenic nitrogen effect range from —0.2 PgC/yr (Nadelhoffer et
al., 1999) to —1.1 or —1.4 PgC/yr (Holland et al., 1997). The
model with the smallest CO, fertilisation effect (-0.9 PgC/yr)
in the McGuire et al. (2001) study has been shown to respond
strongly to anthropogenic nitrogen input, yielding a combined
(CO, and nitrogen) fertilisation effect of —1.5 PgC/yr. A
modelling study by Lloyd (1999) suggests that CO, and
nitrogen fertilisation effects may by synergistic. Evaluation of
model results on carbon-nitrogen coupling against experimental

The most. comprehensive model- based estimates of the terrestrial
components of the anthropogenic CO, budget are those that have
been produced by the CCMLP. McGuire et al. (2001) used two
TBMs and two DGVMs driven by changes in atmospheric CO),
then changes in CO), with historical changes in climate (from
observations), and finally changes in CO) and climate with land-
use change from Ramankutty and Foley (2000) (Figure 3.8; Table
3.4). In these simulations, CO, fertilisation accounted for a land-
atmosphere flux of —0.9 to —3.1 PgC/yr, land-use change a
positive flux of 0.6 to 1.0 PgC/yr, and climate variability a small
additional effect of uncertain sign, -0.2 to 0.9 PgC/yr during the
1980s. The total land-atmosphere flux simulated for the 1980s
amounted to —0.3 to —1.5 PgC/yr, which is consistent with or
slightly more negative than the observationally-based estimate of
—0.2 + 0.7 PgC/yr (Table 3.1). Net uptake by all models reported
in McGuire er al. (2001) is shown to be occurring mainly in
tropical, temperate and boreal forests — consistent with forest
inventory data (Section 3.5.4) — while some regions (notably
semi-arid tropical and sub-tropical regions) show net carbon loss.
The model estimates of the CO, source due to land-use change
are substantially smaller than the estimate of Houghton (1999)
(Section 3.4.2). This divergence primarily reflects disagreements
between the Houghton (1999) and Ramankutty and Foley (2000)
data sets as to the timing of tropical deforestation in different
regions (see Section 3.4.2).

ocean models are the mean vertical gradient in DIC, with enriched
deep ocean concentrations (Goyet and Davies, 1997), and the
spatial patterns of surface pCO, with outgassing in the tropics and
uptake at higher latitudes (Takahashi et al., 1999). Furthermore,
models which incorporate marine biology (including DOC and
plankton dynamics) roughly reproduce the seasonal cycle of
surface ocean pCO , atmospheric O, after it has been corrected for
seasonal land variability, and surface chlorophyll (Six and Maier-

"Ocean uptake is constrained to some degree by observations of
anthropogenic tracers. Three transient tracers are commonly used.
First, anthropogenic CO, itself gives a direct benchmark for model
estimates of the quantity and distribution of anthropogenic CO, that
has penetrated the ocean since the pre-industrial era. Anthropogenic
CO, can be inventoried by an indirect method whereby carbon
concentration is compared to what would be expected from water
exposed to pre-industrial air (Gruber ef al., 1996). The CO,
released in the early 1960s by atmospheric nuclear testing
(commonly called bomb '4C) provides a second tracer; the content
of bomb C in the ocean is used to constrain global air-sea CO,
exchange (Wanninkhof ef al., 1992), and ocean model results can
be compared with its penetration depth as a benchmark for vertical
transport (Broecker et al., 1995). Bomb C is computed by
subtracting the observed '4C concentration from an estimate of its
pre-industrial value (Broecker et al., 1995). Finally, CFCs also
constrain the downward transport of tracers in ocean models. No
natural background needs to be subtracted from CFCs. None of
these three tracers provide a perfect indicator of anthropogenic CO,
uptake: CO, equilibrates with the atmosphere ten times faster than
'4C and ten times slower than CFCs; anthropogenic CO; and '4C
are indirectly estimated. As part of the Ocean Carbon-Cycle Model
Intercomparison Project (OCMIP), a comparison of carbon models
with respect to all three anthropogenic tracers is in progress (Orr
and Dutay, 1999; Orr et al., 2001).

"Three common problems related to marine biology in global
ocean models are discussed here. First, most models poorly
represent the formation and dissolution of CaCO3, which controls
alkalinity. This process is often parameterized as a function of
direct or indirect observations (salinity, temperature, nutrients).
Although correct for the present day ocean, this parametrisation
may not hold for past or future conditions with different ocean
circulation and surface water fluxes. The alkalinity cycle is difficult
to represent because the rate of CaCO; formation derived from
observations is consistently larger than the one required by models
for reproducing observed deep ocean alkalinity (Maier-Reimer,
1993; Yamanaka and Tajika, 1996). Second, marine productivity
tends to be underestimated by models in sub-tropical regions and
overestimated in the equatorial oceans and at high latitudes in the
North Pacific and Southern Oceans. The overestimation may be
caused by limitation in plankton growth by iron (Coale et al.,
1996; Boyd et al., 2000; Archer and Johnson, 2000), while under-
estimation in the sub-tropics partly stems from neglecting
mesoscale variability (McGillicuddy and Robinson, 1997; Oschlies
and Garcon, 1998). The remaining discrepancies might be attrib-
uted in part to more complex processes involving nitrogen fixation
(Karl et al., 1997). Finally, the tight coupling between carbon and
either nitrogen or phosphate, which is generally implicit in ocean
carbon models, precludes the simulation of past or future marine
biological feedback mechanisms that involve a partial decoupling
between carbon and nutrients (see Section 3.2.3).
"	Text
"Although many first-order features can be reproduced by
global models, there are still important aspects of the ocean
carbon cycle that are not well simulated, because either marine
biology or ocean physics are imperfectly reproduced. Ocean
carbon models have difficulties in reproducing the spatial
structure of the deep ocean '4C (Orr et al., 2001), which suggests
problems in simulating the physical exchange of carbon between
surface and the deep ocean. Models display their largest
disagreements where fewest observations exist, in particular in
the important region of the Southern Ocean where the mixing of
tracers is subject to large uncertainties (Caldeira and Duffy,
2000; Sarmiento et al., 2000; Orr et al., 2001). In spite of these
differences, all ocean carbon models estimate zero interhemi-
spheric transport of carbon (Sarmiento ef al., 2000) whereas a
transport as large as 1 PgC/yr has been inferred from
atmospheric CO, measurements (Keeling ef al., 1989).
Consideration of the global transport of carbon by rivers reduces
the discrepancy but does not remove it (Sarmiento and
Sundquist, 1992; Aumont et al., 2001b). Atmospheric CO, and
O, measurements suggest that interhemispheric transport may
be incorrectly simulated by ocean models (Stephens er al.,
1998), and could hint at difficulties in modelling heat transport
(Murnane et al., 1999). Recent data from the Southern Ocean,
however, seem closer to model results (Stephens, 1999) and the
question about interhemispheric transport thus remains open.
These problems could partly be resolved by a better representa-
tion of the physical transport of carbon in the ocean, especially
isopycnal diffusion, sub-grid eddy mixing, and sea-ice formation
(Stephens ef al., 1999).

be indicative of problems in ocean physics mentioned earlier,

The range of model estimates of the climate change impact is
dependent on the choice of scenario for atmospheric CO, and on
assumptions concerning marine biology (Joos et al., 1999b). At
high CO, concentrations, marine biology can have a greater
impact on atmospheric CO, than at low concentrations because
the buffering capacity of the ocean is reduced (see Box 3.3)
(Sarmiento and Le Quéré, 1996). Although the impact of changes
in marine biology is highly uncertain and many key processes
discussed in Section 3.2.3.1 are not included in current models,
sensitivity studies can provide approximate upper and lower

annual ocean-atmosphere flux of CO, continues to become
larger, reaching —6.7 to —4.5 PgC/yr by 2100 (Figure 3.10c).

Several atmosphere-ocean models were used to project the
effect of climate change (Maier-Reimer et al., 1996; Sarmiento et
al., 1998; Matear and Hirst, 1999; Joos et al., 1999b; Bopp et al.,
2001). These models include most processes previously
discussed, including all processes associated with carbonate
chemistry and gas exchange, physical and biological transport of
CO), and changes in temperature, salinity, wind speed, and ice
cover. They account for simple changes in biological produc-
tivity, but not for changes in external nutrient supply, species
composition, pH, or Redfield ratios, all of which could be
involved in more complex biological feedbacks. Coupled models
estimate the impact of climate change as a departure, reported in
per cent, from a “control” experiment modelling the effect of
increasing atmospheric CO) alone.

In climate change simulations, warming of surface waters and
increased stratification of the upper ocean produced an overall
positive feedback that reduced the accumulated ocean uptake of
CO, by 6 to 25% between 1990 and the middle of the 21st
century, as compared with the CO,-only case. In the first part of
the simulation, the climate-mediated feedback is mainly due to
the temperature effect on CO, solubility (Sarmiento and Le
Quéré, 1996; Matear and Hirst, 1999). Towards the mid-century,
the impact of circulation changes becomes significant in most
models, with the net effect of further reducing ocean CO, uptake.
To investigate the effect of climate change on the IS92a scenario,
the average of the OCMIP CO,-only projections (mean of results
in Figure 3.10c) was used as a baseline and the reduction in
atmosphere-ocean CO, flux caused by climate change (in per
cent since the beginning of the simulation) was applied to this
curve (Figure 3.10d). The range in model results (Figure 3.10d)
must be attributed to uncertainties related to climate change
feedback, and not to uncertainties in the modelling of physical

transport as shown in Figure 3.10c.

"Possible feedbacks from terrestrial carbon cycling to
atmospheric CO, were assessed using multiple models by
Cramer et al. (2001). Six DGVMs (Figure 3.10a) (Foley et al.,
1996; Brovkin et al., 1997; Friend et al., 1997; Woodward et
al., 1998; Huntingford er al., 2000; Sitch, 2000) were driven
first by CO, concentrations derived from the IS92a emissions
scenario as in the SAR, and then with CO) changes plus climate
changes derived from the HadCM2 coupled ocean-atmosphere
general circulation model simulation including sulphate aerosol
effects as described by Mitchell et al. (1995). Except for one
empirical model (VECODE; Brovkin et al., 1997), the models
included explicit representation of all the following processes:
the CO, fertilisation effect on NPP (modelled explicitly in
terms of photosynthesis, respiration, and feedbacks associated
with carbon allocation); responses of NPP to climate specific to
each plant functional type (PFT); competition among PFTs for
light and water; dynamic shifts in vegetation structure due to
climate and CO, effects; competitive limits to above-ground
biomass; natural disturbance regimes and their interaction with
PFT composition; soil temperature and moisture effects on
heterotrophic respiration. Two models include an interactive N
cycle. Land use and anthropogenic N deposition were not

"Driven by increases in CO) beyond the present day, the
modelled sink due to CO, fertilisation continued to increase. By
the middle of the 21st century the simulated land-atmosphere
flux due to CO) was in the range —8.7 to —3.6 PgC/yr. Beyond
mid-century the rate of increase became less, due to the
declining photosynthetic response to CO). When the climate
change scenario was included as well as the CO, increase,
modelled uptake was reduced compared with the CO -only
analysis. At mid-century, climate change reduced the uptake by
21 to 43%. A marked decline in terrestrial uptake after the mid-
century was seen in two models, and one model had zero terres-
trial uptake by 2100. By 2100 the range of model estimates of
the land-atmosphere flux had widened to —6.7 to +0.4 PgC/yr.
Increasing heterotrophic respiration in response to warming
(Cao and Woodward, 1998a,b; Cramer et al., 2001) was a
common factor (but not the only one) leading to reduced land
uptake. The differences among the modelled climate responses
were largely due to unresolved discrepancies in the response of
global NPP to temperature. The balance of positive versus
negative regional effects of climate change on NPP was
estimated differently by these models, to the extent that the sign
of the global response of NPP to climate change alone was not
consistent. In addition, one model simulated a partial replace-
ment of the Amazon rainforest by C, grassland. This response
was not shown, or occurred on a much smaller scale, in the
other models. The details of this modelling exercise are presum-
ably dependent on sensitivity of the particular climate model,
and regional aspects of the simulated climate change (Cramer et
al., 2001).

Two general circulation model simulations have included
interactive land and ocean carbon cycle components (Cox et al.,
2000; Friedlingstein et al., 2001). The Cox et al. (2000) model
was driven by CO, emissions from the IS92a scenario (Legget et
al., 1992) and the Friedlingstein et al. (2001) model was driven by
CO), emissions from the SRES A2 scenario (IPCC, 2000b). Both
simulations indicate a positive feedback, i.e., both CO, concentra-
tions and climate change at the end of the 21st century are
increased due to the coupling. The simulated magnitudes of the
effect differ (+70 ppm, Friedlingstein et al., 2001; +270 ppm, Cox
et al., 2000). In the Cox ef al. (2000) simulation, which included
a DGVM, the increased atmospheric CO, is caused mainly by loss
of soil carbon and in part by tropical forest die back. The
magnitude of the climate-carbon cycle feedback still has large
uncertainties associated with the response of the terrestrial
biosphere to climate change, especially the response of
heterotrophic respiration and tropical forest NPP to temperature
(Cox et al., 2000; see Sections 3.2.2.3 and 3.7.1). In the following
section, simplified models are used to assess these uncertainties.

combining different bounding assumptions about the behaviour of the

photosynthesis module, or increased asymptotically following Haxeltine and Prentice (1996). (Although apparently unrealistic
capping the CO, fertilisation in the model is designed to mimic the possibility that other, transient factors such as land managemen
changes might be largely responsible for current terrestrial carbon uptake.) Transport parameters of the ocean model (including ga
exchange) were scaled by a factor of 1.5 and 0.5. Average ocean uptake for the 1980s is 2.0 PgC/yr in the reference case, 1.4

In contrast with the SAR, the results presented here are based
on approximating the behaviour of spatially resolved process-
based models in which CO, and climate responses are not
constrained by prior assumptions about the global carbon budget.
The CO,-only response of both models’ reference cases (Figure
3.11) leads to a 2100 CO, concentration of 682 ppm (ISAM) or
651 ppm (Bern-CC). These values are slightly lower than projected
in the SAR — 715 ppm (ISAM; SAR version) and 712 ppm (Bern
Model; SAR version) — because current process-based terrestrial
models typically yield a stronger CO, response than was assumed
in the SAR. With climate feedbacks included, the 2100 CO,
concentration in the reference case becomes, by coincidence,
effectively indistinguishable from that given in the SAR: 723 ppm
(ISAM) and 706 ppm (Bern-CC). The ranges of 164 ppm or —12%
/ +11% (about the reference case) (ISAM) and 273 ppm or —10%
/ +28% (Bern-CC) in the 2100 CO, concentration indicate that
there is significant uncertainty about the future CO, concentra-
tions due to any one pathway of changes in emissions. Separate

0.6 PgC/yr and a range of 0.0 to 1.5 PgC/yr. These ranges broadly
overlap the range estimates of the 1980s land-use source given in
Table 3.1. Present knowledge of the carbon budget is therefore not
precise enough to allow much narrowing of the uncertainty associ-
ated with future land and ocean uptake as expressed in these
projections. However, the lowest implied land-use source values
fall below the range given in Table 3.1.

The six scenarios lead to substantial differences in projected
CO, concentration trajectories (Figure 3.12). Significant
uncertainties are introduced by the range of model parametriza-
tions considered, so that the trajectories calculated for “adjacent”
scenarios overlap, especially during the first half-century. The
reference cases of the six scenarios account for a range of 2100
CO, concentrations from 541 to 963 ppm in the Bern-CC model
and 549 to 970 ppm in the ISAM model. The uncertainties around
the 2100 values due to model parametrizations are —12 to +10 %
(ISAM) and -14 to +31 % (Bemn- CC).

These uncertainties reflect incomplete understanding of
climate sensitivity and the carbon cycle. They substantially limit
our current ability to make quantitative predictions about the
future consequences of a given emissions trajectory. Nevertheless,
the results show that higher emissions are always expected to lead
to higher projected atmospheric concentrations. They also show
that the range of emissions scenarios currently accepted as
plausible leads to a range of CO) concentrations that exceeds the
likely upper bound of uncertainties due to differences among
model parameterizations and assumptions.

"The Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) (IPCC,
2000b) produced a series of scenarios, of which six are used here,
representing outcomes of distinct narratives of economic develop-
ment and demographic and technological change. In ISAM model
runs with these scenarios, past fossil emissions (see Section 3.4.1),
CO) concentrations (Enting et al., 1994; Keeling and Whorf,
2000) and mean global temperatures (Jones et al., 2000) were
specified up to and including 1999; scenario-based analyses
started in 2000. In the Bern-CC model runs, observed CO,
(Etheridge, et al., 1996, Keeling and Whorf, 2000) and past fossil
emissions (Marland ef al., 1999) were prescribed, and historical
temperature changes were modelled, based on radiative forcing
from greenhouse gases and aerosols; again, scenario-based
analyses started in 2000. Past emissions from changing land use
were calculated in order to balance the carbon budget.

In conclusion, anthropogenic CO, emissions are virtually
certain to be the dominant factor determining CO2 concentrations
throughout the 21st century. The importance of anthropogenic
emissions is underlined by the expectation that the proportion of
emissions taken up by both ocean and land will decline at high
atmospheric CO, concentrations (even if absolute uptake by the
ocean continues to rise). There is considerable uncertainty in
projections of future CO, concentration, because of uncertainty
about the effects of climate change on the processes determining
ocean and land uptake of CO}. These uncertainties do not negate
the main finding that anthropogenic emissions will be the main
control.

Stabilisation scenarios illustrate implied rates of CO, emission
that would arrive at various stable CO, concentration levels.
These have been projected using a similar methodology to that
applied in the analysis of emissions scenarios. The WRE trajec-
tories follow CO, concentrations consistent with the IS92a
scenario beginning in 1990 and branch off to reach constant CO,
concentrations of 450, 550, 650, 750 and 1,000 ppm (Wigley et
al., 1996). The rationale for various alternative time trajectories
and stabilisation levels is discussed in Chapter 2 of the IPCC
WGIII Third Assessment Report (Morita et al., 2001).
Differences in emissions pathways for different time trajectories
leading to a certain stabilisation target (e.g., S versus WRE
profiles) are discussed in Schimel er al., (1997). Here, we have
calculated emissions for one set of emission profiles to illustrate
differences in implied emissions that arise from updating models
since the SAR.

"As in Section 3.7.3.2, the models were initialised up to present.
Then anthropogenic emissions for the prescribed CO, stabilization
profiles were calculated; deduced emissions equal the change in
modeled ocean and terrestrial carbon inventories plus the
prescribed change in atmospheric CO, content. To estimate the
strength of carbon cycle-climate feedbacks, global temperature
(ISAM) and changes in the fields of temperature, precipitation and
cloud cover (Bern-CC) were projected from CO, radiative forcing
only, neglecting effects of other greenhouse gases and aerosols
which are not specified in the WRE profiles. The results for the
reference cases are not substantially different from those presented
in the SAR (Figure 3.13). However, the range based on alternative
model parametrizations is larger than presented in the SAR, mainly
due to the range of simulated terrestrial CO, uptake. CO) stabilisa-
tion at 450, 650 or 1,000ppm would require global anthropogenic
CO), emissions to drop below 1990 levels, within a few decades,
about a century, or about two centuries, respectively.

Large-scale manipulations of terrestrial ecosystems have been
proposed as a means of slowing the increase of atmospheric CO,
during the 21st century in support of the aims of the Kyoto
Protocol (Tans and Wallace, 1999; IPCC, 2000a). Based on
current understanding of land use in the carbon cycle, the impacts
of future land use on terrestrial biosphere-atmosphere exchanges
have the potential to modify atmospheric CO, concentrations on
this time-scale. Direct effects of land-use changes are thought to
represent about 10 to 30% of total anthropogenic CO, emissions
(Table 3.1), so there is scope for either intended or unintended
changes in land use to reduce or increase total anthropogenic
emissions. But the possibilities for enhancing natural sinks have to
be placed in perspective: a rough upper bound for the reduction in
CO) concentration that could be achieved by enhancing terrestrial
carbon uptake through land-use change over the coming century
is 40 to 70 ppm (Section 3.2.2.2), to be considered against a two
to four times larger potential for increasing CO) concentraion by
deforestation, and a >400 ppm range among the SRES scenarios
(Figure 3.12).
"	Text
"The differences among the CO, concentrations projected with the
various SRES scenarios considered are larger than the differences
caused by inclusion or omission of climate-mediated feedbacks.
The range of uptake rates projected by process-based models for
any one scenario is, however, considerable, due to uncertainties
about (especially) terrestrial ecosystem responses to high CO,
concentrations, which have not yet been resolved experimentally,
and uncertainties about the response of global NPP to changes in
climate (Cramer et al., 1999). A smaller feedback would be
implied if, as some models indicate, global NPP increases with
warming throughout the relevant range of climates and no forest
die back occurs. Larger positive feedbacks would be implied if
regional drying caused partial die back of tropical forests, as some
of the DGVMs in Cramer et al. (2001), and one coupled climate-
carbon model study of Cox ef al. (2000), suggest; however,
another coupled climate-carbon model study (Friedlingstein et al.,
2001) suggests a smaller feedback. Uncertainty also arises due to
differences in the climate responses of ocean models, especially as
regards the extent and effects (biological as well as physical) of
increased stratification in a warmer climate (Joos et al., 1999b).

"In all cases, once CO, concentration becomes constant, the
implied anthropogenic emission declines steadily. This result was
expected. It highlights the fact that to maintain a constant future
CO, concentration, anthropogenic CO, emissions would
ultimately have to be reduced to the level of persistent natural
sinks. Persistent terrestrial sinks are not well quantified;
peatlands may be a candidate, but the gradual rise in atmospheric
CO, concentration during the present interglacial (Figure 3.2)
argues against any such sink. Estimates of current uptake by
peatlands are <0.1 PgC/yr (Clymo et al., 1998). Mixing of ocean
DIC between surface and deep waters should continue to produce
ocean uptake for several centuries after an input of anthropogenic
atmospheric CO, (Siegenthaler and Oeschger, 1978; Maier-
Reimer and Hasselmann, 1987; Sarmiento ef al., 1992). This
mixing is the main reason for continued uptake (and therefore
positive calculated emissions) after stabilisation. However, the
main, known natural sink expected to persist longer than a few
centuries is that due to dissolution of CaCO; in ocean sediments,
which increases ocean alkalinity and thereby allows additional
CO, to dissolve in the ocean. For CO, concentrations about 1,000
ppm, this sink is estimated to be smaller than about —0.1 PgC/yr
(Archer et al., 1998). Thus, for any significant CO, emissions to

controlled primarily by emissions of CHy, carbon monoxide (CO),
nitrogen oxides (NO,), and volatile organic compounds (VOC).
There is now greater confidence in the model assessment of the
increase in tropospheric O; since the pre-industrial period, which
amounts to 30% when globally averaged, as well as the response
to future emissions. For scenarios in which the CH, abundance
doubles and anthropogenic CO and NO, emissions triple, the
tropospheric O3 abundance is predicted to increase by an

additional 50% above today’s abundance.

The atmospheric lifetime relates emissions of a component
to its atmospheric burden. In some cases, for instance for
methane, a change in emissions perturbs the chemistry and thus
the corresponding lifetime. The CH, feedback effect amplifies
the climate forcing of an addition of CH, to the current
atmosphere by lengthening the perturbation lifetime relative to
the global atmospheric lifetime of CH, by a factor of 1.4. This
earlier finding is corroborated here by new model studies that
also predict only small changes in this CH, feedback for the
different scenarios projected to year 2100. Another feedback
has been identified for the addition of N,O to the atmosphere;
it is associated with stratospheric O3 chemistry and shortens the
perturbation lifetime relative to the global atmospheric lifetime
of N,O by about 5%.

Several chemically reactive gases - CO, NO, (=NO+NO3),
and VOC — control in part the abundance of O3 and the
oxidising capacity (OH) of the troposphere. These pollutants
act as indirect greenhouse gases through their influence on
atmospheric chemistry, e.g., formation of tropospheric O3 or
changing the lifetime of CHy. The emissions of NO, and CO are
dominated by human activities. The abundance of CO in the
Northern Hemisphere is about twice that in the Southern
Hemisphere and has increased in the second half of the 20th
century along with industrialisation and population. The urban
and regional abundance of NO, has generally increased with
industrialisation, but the global abundance of this short-lived,
highly variable pollutant cannot be derived from measurements.
Increased NO, abundances will in general increase tropospheric
O; and decrease CH,. Deposition of NO, reaction products
fertilises the biosphere, stimulates CO, uptake, but also
provides an input of acidic precipitation.

An important policy issue is the complete impact of
different industrial or agricultural sectors on climate. This
requires aggregation of the SRES scenarios by sector (e.g.,
transportation) or sub-sector (e.g., aviation; Penner et al., 1999),
including not only emissions but also changes in land use or
natural ecosystems. Due to chemical coupling, correlated
emissions can have synergistic effects; for instance NO, and CO
from transportation produce regional O} increases. Thus a given
sector may act through several channels on the future trends of
greenhouse gases. In this chapter we will evaluate the data

atmospheric burdens of CH, and N,O over the next century will
likely be driven by changes in both anthropogenic and natural
sources. A second class of greenhouse gases — the synthetic
HFCs, PFCs, SF5, CFCs, and halons — did not exist in the
atmosphere before the 20th century (Butler et al., 1999). CFy, a
PEC, is detected in ice cores and appears to have an extremely
small natural source (Harnisch and Eisenhauer, 1998). The
current burdens of these latter gases are derived from atmospheric
observations and represent accumulations of past anthropogenic
releases; their future burdens depend almost solely on industrial
production and release to the atmosphere. Stratospheric H,O

The current global emissions, mean abundances, and trends
of the gases mentioned above are summarised in Table 4. 1a.
Table 4.1b lists additional synthetic greenhouse gases without
established atmospheric abundances. For the Montreal Protocol
gases, political regulation has led to a phase-out of emissions
that has slowed their atmospheric increases, or turned them into
decreases, such as for CFC-11. For other greenhouse gases, the
anthropogenic emissions are projected to increase or remain
high in the absence of climate-policy regulations. Projections of
future emissions for this assessment, i.e., the IPCC Special
Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) (Nakicenovié et al.,
2000) anticipate future development of industries and agricul-
ture that represent major sources of greenhouse gases in the

greenhouse gas concentrations derived from the SRES prelimi-

"This chapter investigates greenhouse gases whose atmospheric
burdens! and climate impacts generally depend on atmospheric
chemistry. These greenhouse gases include those listed in the
Kyoto Protocol — methane (CHy), nitrous oxide (N,O), hydro-
fluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur
hexafluoride (SF,) — and those listed under the Montreal Protocol
and its Amendments — the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), and the halons. A major
focus of this assessment is the change in tropospheric ozone (O3).
Stratospheric water vapour (H,O) is also treated here, but tropo-
spheric H,O, which is part of the hydrological cycle and
calculated within climate models, is not discussed. This chapter
also treats the reactive gases carbon monoxide (CO), volatile
organic compounds (VOC), and nitrogen oxides (NO, =
NO+NO,), termed indirect greenhouse gases. These pollutants
are not significant direct greenhouse gases, but through
atmospheric chemistry they control the abundances! of direct
greenhouse gases. This chapter reviews the factors controlling the
current atmospheric abundances of direct and indirect
greenhouse gases; it looks at the changes since the pre-industrial
era and their attribution to anthropogenic activities; and it
calculates atmospheric abundances to the year 2100 based on
projected emissions of greenhouse gases and pollutants. Carbon
dioxide (CO}) is treated in Chapter 3; and aerosols in Chapter 5.
The atmospheric abundances of greenhouse gases and aerosols
from all chapters are combined in Chapter 6 to calculate current
and future radiative forcing. This chapter is an update of the
IPCC WGI Second Assessment Report (IPCC, 1996) (hereafter
SAR). For a review of the chemical processes controlling the
abundance of greenhouse gases see the SAR (Prather et al., 1995)
or Ehhalt (1999). More recent assessments of changing
atmospheric chemistry and composition include the IPCC

comprised of surface emissions. For synthetic gases where
industrial production and emissions are well documented, the
source strengths may be accurately known. For CH, and N,O,
however, there are large, not well-quantified, natural emissions.
Further, the anthropogenic emissions of these gases are
primarily associated with agricultural sources that are difficult
to quantify accurately. Considerable research has gone into
identifying and quantifying the emissions from individual
sources for CH, and N,O, as discussed below. Such uncertainty

its trend (i.e., the difference between sources and sinks, in

for the long-lived gases, are usually the best-known quantities
in the budgets. For short-lived, highly variable gases such as

N2O and CFCs) supply ozone-depleting radicals (e.g., nitric

between the gas and its loss rate. Another consequence of the
observed stratospheric ozone depletion is that tropospheric
photochemical activity is expected to have increased, altering
tropospheric OH and O;. Climate change in the 21st century,
including the radiative cooling of the stratosphere by increased
levels of CO , is expected to alter stratospheric circulation and

The sink strength (Tg/yr) of long-lived greenhouse gases
can be derived from a combination of atmospheric observa-
tions, laboratory experiments, and models. The atmospheric
chemistry models are based on physical principles and labora-
tory data, and include as constraints the observed chemistry of
the atmosphere over the past two decades. For example, strato-
spheric loss rates are derived from models either by combining
observed trace gas distributions with theoretically calculated
loss frequencies or from the measured correlation of the respec-
tive gas with a trace gas of known vertical flux. In such analyses
there are a wide range of self-consistency checks. Mean global
loss rates based on a priori modelling (e.g., the CHy,-lifetime
studies from OxComp described later) can be compared with
empirically-based loss rates that are scaled from a gas with
similar loss processes that has well-known emissions and

"Tropospheric OH abundances depend on abundances of

(>300 nm) that reaches the troposphere. As a consequence, OH
varies widely with geographical location, time of day, and
season. Likewise the local loss rates of all those gases reacting
with OH also vary. Because of its dependence on CH, and
other pollutants, tropospheric OH is expected to have changed
since the pre-industrial era and to change again for future
emission scenarios. For some of these gases other removal
processes, such as photolysis or surface uptake, are also
important; and the total sink of the gas is obtained by
integrating over all such processes. The chemistry of tropos-

varies with changing precursor emissions. The chemistry of the
troposphere is also directly influenced by the stratospheric
burden of O3, climatic changes in temperature (T) and
humidity (H,O), as well as by interactions between tropo-
spheric aerosols and trace gases. Such couplings provide a
“feedback” between the climate change induced by increasing
greenhouse gases and the concentration of these gases. Another
feedback, internal to the chemistry, is the impact of CH, on OH

The atmospheric lifetime is basically a scale factor relating
(i) constant emissions (Tg/yr) to a steady-state burden (Tg), or
(ii) an emission pulse (Tg) to the time-integrated burden of that
pulse (Tg/yr). The lifetime is often additionally assumed to be
a constant, independent of the sources; and it is also taken to
represent the decay time (e-fold) of a perturbation. These latter
assumptions apply rigorously only for a gas whose local
chemical lifetime is constant in space and time, such as for the
noble gas radon, whose lifetime is fixed by the rate of its
radioactive decay. In such a case the mean atmospheric lifetime
equals the local lifetime: the lifetime that relates source strength
to global burden is exactly the decay time of a perturbation.

"The global atmospheric lifetime (yr) characterises the time
required to turn over the global atmospheric burden. It is
defined as the burden (Tg) divided by the mean global sink
(Tg/yr) for a gas in steady state (i.e., with unchanging burden).
This quantity was defined as both “lifetime” and “turnover
time” in the SAR (see also Bolin and Rodhe, 1973). Lifetimes
calculated in this manner are listed in Table 4.1. A corollary of
this definition is that, when in steady state (i.e., source strength
= sink strength), the atmospheric burden of a gas equals the
product of its lifetime and its emissions. A further corollary is
that the integrated atmospheric abundance following a single
emission is equal to the product of its steady-state lifetime for
that emission pattern and the amount emitted (Prather, 1996).
This latter, new result since the SAR supports the market-basket
approach of aggregating the direct emissions of different
greenhouse gases with a GWP (Global Warming Potential)
weighting.

This general applicability of the atmospheric lifetime
breaks down for those greenhouse gases and pollutants whose
chemical losses vary in space and time. NO,, for instance, has
a local lifetime of <1 day in the lower troposphere, but >5 days
in the upper troposphere; and both times are less than the time
required for vertical mixing of the troposphere. In this case
emission of NO, into the upper troposphere will produce a
larger atmospheric burden than the same emission into the
lower troposphere. Consequently, the definition of the
atmospheric lifetime of NO, is not unique and depends on the
location (and season) of its emissions. The same is true for any
gas whose local lifetime is variable and on average shorter than
about 0.5 year, i.e., the decay time of a north-south difference
between hemispheres representing one of the longer time-scales
for tropospheric mixing. The majority of greenhouse gases
considered here have atmospheric lifetimes greater than 2 years,
much longer than tropospheric mixing times; and hence their
lifetimes are not significantly altered by the location of sources
"	Text
"Some gases have chemical feedbacks that change their
lifetimes. For example, the increasing CH, abundance leads to
a longer lifetime for CH, (Prather et al., 1995; Schimel er al.,
1996). A chemical feedback with opposite effect has been
identified for N,O where a greater NO burden leads to
increases in stratospheric NO, which in turn depletes mid-
stratospheric ozone. This ozone loss enhances the UV, and as a
consequence NO is photolysed more rapidly (Prather, 1998).
Such feedbacks cause the time-scale of a perturbation,
henceforth called perturbation lifetime (PT), to differ from the
global atmospheric lifetime (LT). In the limit of small perturba-
tions, the relation between the perturbation lifetime of a gas and
its global atmospheric lifetime can be derived from a simple
budget relationship as PT = LT /(J — s), where the sensitivity
coefficient s = dln(LT) / dln(B) and B = burden. Without a
feedback on lifetime, s = 0, and PT is identical to LT. The
product, PT times a sustained change in emission, gives the
resulting change in the burden. The ratio of PT/LT adopted here
for CH,, 1.4, is based on recent model studies (see Section 4.4)
and is consistent with the SAR results.

"To evaluate the total greenhouse effect of a given gas
molecule, one needs to know, first, how long it remains in the
atmosphere and, second, how it interacts chemically with other
molecules. This effect is calculated by injecting a pulse of that
gas (e.g., 1 Tg) into the atmosphere and watching the added
abundance decay as simulated in a CTM. This decay is
represented by a sum of exponential functions, each with its
own decay time. These exponential functions are the chemical
modes of the linearised chemistry-transport equations of the
CTM (Prather, 1996). In the case of a CH, addition, the longest-
lived mode has an e-fold time of 12 years, close to the pertur-
bation lifetime (PT) of CHy, and carries most of the added
burden. (This e-fold time was called the adjustment time in the
SAR.) In the case of a CO addition, this same mode is also
excited, but at a reduced amplitude (Prather, 1996; Daniel and
Solomon, 1998). The pulse of added CO, by causing the
concentration of OH to decrease and thus the lifetime of CH, to
increase temporarily, causes a build-up of CH, while the added
burden of CO persists. After the initial period of a few months
defined by the CO photochemical lifetime, this built-up CH,
then decays in the same manner as would a direct pulse of CHy.
Similarly, an addition of NO, (e.g., from aviation; see Isaksen
and Jackman, 1999) will excite this mode, but with a negative
amplitude. Thus, changes in the emissions of short-lived gases
can generate long-lived perturbations as shown in 3-D CTMs
(Wild and Prather, 2000; Derwent et al., 2001). Changes in
tropospheric O3 accompany the CH, decay on a 12 year time-
scale as an inherent component of this mode, a key example of
chemical coupling in the troposphere. Thus, any chemically
reactive gas, whether a greenhouse gas or not, will produce
some level of indirect greenhouse effect through its impact on
atmospheric chemistry.

evidenced by measurements of CHy in air extracted from ice

Methane’s globally averaged atmospheric surface abundance in
1998 was 1,745 ppb (see Figure 4.1), corresponding to a total
burden of about 4,850 Tg(CH,). The uncertainty in the burden
is small (5%) because the spatial and temporal distributions of
tropospheric and stratospheric CH, have been determined by
extensive high-precision measurements and the tropospheric
variability is relatively small. For example, the Northern
Hemisphere CH, abundances average about 5% higher than
those in the Southern Hemisphere. Seasonal variations, with a
minimum in late summer, are observed with peak-to-peak
amplitudes of about 2% at mid-latitudes. The average vertical
gradient in the troposphere is negligible, but CH, abundances in
the stratosphere decrease rapidly with altitude, e.g., to 1,400
ppb at 30 km altitude in the tropics and to 500 ppb at 30 km in
high latitude northern winter.

"The current emissions from CH, hydrate deposits appear
small, about 10 Tg/yr. However, these deposits are enormous,
about 107 TgC (Suess et al., 1999), and there is an indication of
a catastrophic release of a gaseous carbon compound about 55
million years ago, which has been attributed to a large-scale
perturbation of CH, hydrate deposits (Dickens, 1999; Norris and
RGhl, 1999). Recent research points to regional releases of CHy
from clathrates in ocean sediments during the last 60,000 years
(Kennett et al., 2000), but much of this CH, is likely to be
oxidised by bacteria before reaching the atmosphere (Dickens,
2001). This evidence adds to the concern that the expected global
warming may lead to an increase in these emissions and thus to
another positive feedback in the climate system. So far, the size
of that feedback has not been quantified. On the other hand, the
historic record of atmospheric CH, derived from ice cores (Petit
et al., 1999), which spans several large temperature swings plus
glaciations, constrains the possible past releases from methane
hydrates to the atmosphere. Indeed, Brook et al. (2000) find little
evidence for rapid, massive CH, excursions that might be associ-
ated with large-scale decomposition of methane hydrates in
sediments during the past 50,000 years.

This loss term can be quantified with relatively good accuracy
based on the mean global OH concentration derived from the
methyl! chloroform (CH;CCL3) budget described in Section 4.2.6
on OH. In that way we obtain a mean global loss rate of 507
Tg(CH,)/yr for the current tropospheric removal of CH, by OH.
In addition there are other minor removal processes for
atmospheric CHy. Reaction with Cl atoms in the marine
boundary layer probably constitutes less than 2% of the total sink
(Singh et al., 1996). A recent process model study (Ridgwell et
al., 1999) suggested a soil sink of 38 Tg/yr, and this can be
compared to SAR estimates of 30 Tg/yr. Minor amounts of CHy
are also destroyed in the stratosphere by reactions with OH, Cl,
and O('D), resulting in a combined loss rate of 40 Tg/yr.
Summing these, our best estimate of the current global loss rate
of atmospheric CH, totals 576 Tg/yr (see Table 4.2), which
agrees reasonably with the total sources derived from process
models. The atmospheric lifetime of CH, derived from this loss
rate and the global burden is 8.4 years. Attributing individual
lifetimes to the different components of CH, loss results in 9.6
years for loss due to tropospheric OH, 120 years for stratospheric
loss, and 160 years for the soil sink (ie., 1/8.4 yr = 1/9.6 yr +
1/120 yr + 1/160 yr).

"The most important known sources of atmospheric
methane are listed in Table 4.2. Although the major source
terms of atmospheric CH, have probably been identified, many
of the source strengths are still uncertain due to the difficulty in
assessing the global emission rates of the biospheric sources,
whose strengths are highly variable in space and time: e.g.,
local emissions from most types of natural wetland can vary by
a few orders of magnitude over a few metres. Nevertheless, new
approaches have led to improved estimates of the global
emissions rates from some source types. For instance, intensive
studies on emissions from rice agriculture have substantially
improved these emissions estimates (Ding and Wang, 1996;
Wang and Shangguan, 1996). Further, integration of emissions
over a whole growth period (rather than looking at the
emissions on individual days with different ambient tempera-
tures) has lowered the estimates of CH, emissions from rice
agriculture from about 80 Tg/yr to about 40 Tg/yr (Neue and
Sass, 1998; Sass et al., 1999). There have also been attempts to
deduce emission rates from observed spatial and temporal
distributions of atmospheric CH, through inverse modelling
(e.g., Hein et al., 1997; Houweling er al., 1999). The emissions
so derived depend on the precise knowledge of the mean global
loss rate and represent a relative attribution into aggregated
sources of similar properties. The results of some of these
studies have been included in Table 4.2. The global CH, budget
can also be constrained by measurements of stable isotopes
(8'3C and 8D) and radiocarbon (!4CH,) in atmospheric CH, and
in CH, from the major sources (e.g., Stevens and Engelkemeir,
1988; Wahlen et al., 1989; Quay et al., 1991, 1999; Lassey et
al., 1993; Lowe et al., 1994). So far the measurements of
isotopic composition of CH, have served mainly to constrain
the contribution from fossil fuel related sources. The emissions
from the various sources sum up to a global total of about 600
Tg/yr, of which about 60% are related to human activities such
as agriculture, fossil fuel use and waste disposal. This is consis-
tent with the SRES estimate of 347 Tg/yr for anthropogenic

There is no consensus on the causes of the long-term decline
in the annual growth rate. Assuming a constant mean atmospheric
lifetime of CH, of 8.9 years as derived by Prinn et al. (1995),
Dlugokencky et al. (1998) suggest that during the period 1984 to
1997 global emissions were essentially constant and that the
decline in annual growth rate was caused by an approach to
steady state between global emissions and atmospheric loss rate.
Their estimated average source strength was about 550 Tg/yr.
(inclusion of a soil sink term of 30 Tg/yr would decrease the
lifetime to 8.6 years and suggest an average source strength of
about 570 Tg/yr.) Francey et al. (1999), using measurements of
'3CH, from Antarctic firn air samples and archived air from Cape
Grim, Tasmania, also concluded that the decreased CH, growth
rate was consistent with constant OH and constant or very slowly
increasing CH, sources after 1982. However, other analyses of
the global methyl chloroform (CH;CCl;) budget (Krol er al.,
1998) and the changing chemistry of the atmosphere (Karlsdottir
and Isaksen, 2000) argue for an increase in globally averaged OH
of +0.5%/yr over the last two decades (see Section 4.2.6 below)
and hence a parallel increase in global CH, emissions by
+0.5%/yr.

The enhanced N,0 ¢ emissions from agricultural and natural
ecosystems are believed to be caused by increasing soil N
availability driven by increased fertilizer use, agricultural
nitrogen (N>) fixation, and N deposition; and this model can
explain the increase in atmospheric N,O abundances over the last
150 years (Nevison and Holland, 1997). Recent discovery of a
faster-than-linear feedback in the emission of N,O and NO from
soils in response to external N inputs is important, given the
projected increases of N fertilisation and deposition increases in
tropical countries (Matson et al., 1999). Tropical ecosystems,
currently an important source of N,O (and NO) are often
phosphorus-limited rather than being N-limited like the Northern
Hemispheric terrestrial ecosystems. Nitrogen fertiliser inputs into
these phosphorus-limited ecosystems generate NO and N,O
fluxes that are 10 to 100 times greater than the same fertiliser
addition to nearby N-limited ecosystems (Hall and Matson,
1999). In addition to N availability, soil NO emissions are
regulated by temperature and soil moisture and so are likely to
respond to climate changes (Frolking ef al., 1998; Parton et al.,
1998). The magnitude of this response will be affected by
feedbacks operating through the biospheric carbon cycle (Li et
al., 1992, 1996).

but is rather incorporated into the net emission of N,O from soils
because it is coupled to the overall N-partitioning.

Isotopic (8!°N and §'8O) NO measurements are also used to
constrain the N,O budget. The isotopic composition of tropo-
spheric NO derives from the flux-weighted isotopic composition
of sources corrected for fractionation during destruction in the
stratosphere. Typical observed values are 8!5N = 7 %o and 6'8O =
20.7 %o relative to atmospheric Nz and oxygen (O) (Kim and

"other processes (sources or sinks) must lead to isotopic enrich-

show that the tropospheric isotope signature of N,O can be
explained by a return flux of isotopically enriched NO from the
stratosphere, and no exotic sources of N»O are needed. Yung and
Miller (1997) point out that large isotopic fractionation can occur
in the stratosphere during photolysis due to small differences in
the zero point energies of the different isotopic species, and Rahn
et al. (1998) have verified this latter effect with laboratory
measurements. Wingen and Finlayson-Pitts (1998) failed to find
evidence that reaction of CO; with Nj (McElroy and Jones, 1996)
is an atmospheric source of NO. The use of isotopes has not yet
conclusively identified new sources nor constrained the N,O

isotopic measurements, including measurements of the intra-
molecular position of ‘SN in NO isotopomers (Yoshida and

HFC-23 is a by-product of HCFC-22 production. It has a long
atmospheric lifetime of 260 years, so that most emissions, which
have occurred over the past two decades, will have accumulated
in the atmosphere. Between 1978 and 1995, HFC-23 increased
from about 3 to 10 ppt; and it continues to rise even more rapidly

by massive increase in stratospheric aerosols following the

PFCs, in particular CF, and C,F,, as well as SF, have sources
predominantly in the Northern Hemisphere, atmospheric lifetimes
longer than 1,000 years, and large absorption cross-sections for
terrestrial infra-red radiation. These compounds are far from a
steady state between sources and sinks, and even small emissions
will contribute to radiative forcing over the next several millennia.
Current emissions of C,F, and SF, are clearly anthropogenic and
well quantified by the accumulating atmospheric burden. Harnisch
and Eisenhauer (1998) have shown that CF, and SF, are naturally
present in fluorites, and out-gassing from these materials leads to
natural background abundances of 40 ppt for CF, and 0.01 ppt for
SF,. However, at present the anthropogenic emissions of CF,
exceed the natural ones by a factor of 1,000 or more and are
responsible for the rapid rise in atmospheric abundance.
Atmospheric burdens of CF, and SF¢ are increasing as shown in
Figures 4.4 and 4.5, respectively. Surface measurements show that
SF, has increased by about 7%/yr during the 1980s and 1990s
(Geller et al., 1997; Maiss and Brenninkmeijer, 1998). Recent
relative rates of increase are 1.3%/yr for CF, and 3.2%/yr for C.F,
(Harnisch et al., 1996). The only important sinks for PFCs and SF,
are photolysis or ion reactions in the mesosphere. These gases
provide useful tracers of atmospheric transport in both troposphere

and stratosphere.

attributed to anthropogenic emissions. Fossil sources of CO have
already been accounted for as release of fossil C in the CO,

"It has been proposed that CO emissions should have a GWP
because of their effects on the lifetimes of other greenhouse gases
(Shine et al., 1990; Fuglesvedt et al., 1996; Prather, 1996). Daniel
and Solomon (1998) estimate that the cumulative indirect
radiative forcing due to anthropogenic CO emissions may be
larger than that of N,O. Combining these early box models with
3-D global CTM studies using models from OxComp (Wild and
Prather, 2000; Derwent et al., 2001) suggests that emitting 100
Tg(CO) is equivalent to emitting 5 Tg(CH,): the resulting CHy
perturbation appears after a few months and lasts 12 years as
would a CH, perturbation; and further, the resulting tropospheric
O; increase is global, the same as for a direct CH, perturbation.
Effectively the CO emission excites the global 12-year
chemical mode that is associated with CH, perturbations. This
equivalency is not unique as the impact of CO appears to vary
by as much as 20% with latitude of emission. Further, this
equivalency systematically underestimates the impact of CO on
greenhouse gases because it does not include the short-term
tropospheric O; increase during the early period of very high CO
abundances (< 6 months). Such O}; increases are regional,
however, and their magnitude depends on local conditions.

"Molecular hydrogen (H>) is not a direct greenhouse gas. But
it can reduce OH and thus indirectly increase CH, and HFCs. Its
atmospheric abundance is about 500 ppb. Simmonds et al. (2000)
report a trend of +1.2 + 0.8 ppb/yr for background air at Mace
Head, Ireland between 1994 and 1998; but, in contrast, Novelli et
al. (1999) report a trend of —2.3 + 0.1 ppb/yr based on a global
network of sampling sites. Hy is produced in many of the same
processes that produce CO (e.g., combustion of fossil fuel and
atmospheric oxidation of CH,), and its atmospheric measure-
ments can be used to constrain CO and CH, budgets. Ehhalt
(1999) estimates global annual emissions of about 70 Tg(H,)/yr,
of which half are anthropogenic. About one third of atmospheric
Hy is removed by reaction with tropospheric OH, and the
remainder, by microbial uptake in soils. Due to the larger land
area in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern
Hemisphere, most H) is lost in the Northern Hemisphere. As a
result, H, abundances are on average greater in the Southern
Hemisphere despite 70% of emissions being in the Northern
Hemisphere (Novelli et al., 1999; Simmonds et al., 2000).
Currently the impact of H, on tropospheric OH is small,
comparable to some of the VOC. No scenarios for changing H,
emissions are considered here; however, in a possible fuel-cell
economy, future emissions may need to be considered as a
potential climate perturbation.

"The depletion of stratospheric ozone over the past three
decades has been substantial. Between 60°S and 60°N it
averaged about 2%/decade. A thorough review of the direct and
possible indirect effects of stratospheric ozone depletion are
given in WMO (Granier and Shine, 1999). The depletion of O;
(and its radiative forcing) is expected to follow the weighted
halogen abundance in the stratosphere. Therefore, both will reach
a maximum in about 2000 before starting to recover; however,
detection of stratospheric O3 recovery is not expected much
before 2010 (Jackman et al., 1996; Hofmann and Pyle, 1999).
Methyl chloroform has been the main driver of the rapid
turnaround in stratospheric chlorine during the late 1990s
(Montzka ef al., 1999; Prinn et al., 2000), and further recovery
will rely on the more slowly declining abundances of CFC-11
and -12, and halons (Fraser er al., 1999; Montzka er al., 1999). It
is expected that stratospheric ozone depletion due to halogens
will recover during the next 50 to 100 years (Hofmann and Pyle,
1999). In the short run, climatic changes, such as cooling in the
northern winter stratosphere, may enhance ozone depletion, but
over the next century, the major uncertainties in stratospheric
ozone lie with (i) the magnitude of future consumption of ozone-
depleting substances by developing countries (Fraser and Prather,
1999; Montzka et al., 1999), (ii) the projected abundances of CH,
and N,O, and (iii) the projected climate change impacts on
stratospheric temperatures and circulation.

"Carbon monoxide (CO) does not absorb terrestrial infrared
radiation strongly enough to be counted as a direct greenhouse
gas, but its role in determining tropospheric OH indirectly affects
the atmospheric burden of CH, (Isaksen and Hov, 1987) and can
lead to the formation of O3. More than half of atmospheric CO
emissions today are caused by human activities, and as a result
the Northern Hemisphere contains about twice as much CO as
the Southern Hemisphere. Because of its relatively short lifetime
and distinct emission patterns, CO has large gradients in the
atmosphere, and its global burden of about 360 Tg is more
uncertain than those of CH, or NO. In the high northern
latitudes, CO abundances vary from about 60 ppb during summer
to 200 ppb during winter. At the South Pole, CO varies between
about 30 ppb in summer and 65 ppb in winter. Observed
abundances, supported by column density measurements, suggest
that globally, CO was slowly increasing until the late 1980s, but
has started to decrease since then (Zander et al. 1989; Khalil and
Rasmussen, 1994), possibly due to decreased automobile
emissions as a result of catalytic converters (Bakwin et al., 1994).
Measurements from a globally distributed network of sampling
sites indicate that CO decreased globally by about 2 %/yr from
1991 to 1997 (Novelli et al., 1998) but then increased in 1998. In
the Southern Hemisphere, no long-term trend has been detected
in CO measurements from Cape Point, South Africa for the

Volatile organic compounds (VOC), which include non-methane
hydrocarbons (NMHC) and oxygenated NMHC (e.g., alcohols,
aldehydes and organic acids), have short atmospheric lifetimes
(fractions of a day to months) and small direct impact on radiative
forcing. VOC influence climate through their production of
organic aerosols and their involvement in photochemistry, i.e.,
production of O3; in the presence of NO, and light. The largest
source, by far, is natural emission from vegetation. Isoprene, with
the largest emission rate, is not stored in plants and is only
emitted during photosynthesis (Lerdau and Keller, 1997).

naturally by the oceans. Anthropogenic sources of VOC include
fuel production, distribution, and combustion, with the largest

ethane as a function of latitude. Ehhalt et al. (1991) report a
trend of +0.8%/yr in the column density above Jungfraujoch,
Switzerland for the period 1951 to 1988, but in the following
years, the trend turned negative. Mahieu et al. (1997) report a
trend in C,H, of —2.7 + 0.3%/yr at Jungfraujoch, Switzerland for

that anthropogenic emissions of most VOC have risen since pre-
industrial times due to increased use of gasoline and other
hydrocarbon products. Due to the importance of VOC
abundance in determining tropospheric O3 and OH, systematic
measurements and analyses of their budgets will remain

important in understanding the chemistry- -climate coupling.

"By rapidly converting HO, to OH, NO enhances tropo-
spheric OH abundances and thus indirectly reduces the
atmospheric burdens of CO, CHy, and HFCs. Much of recent
understanding of the role of NO, in producing tropospheric O;
and changing OH abundances is derived from in situ measure-
ment campaigns that sample over a wide range of chemical
conditions in the upper troposphere or at the surface (see Section
4.2.6 on tropospheric OH). These atmospheric measurements
generally support the current photochemical models. There is
substantial spatial and temporal variability in the measured
abundance of NO,, which ranges from a few ppt near the surface
over the remote tropical Pacific Ocean to >100 ppb in urban
regions. The local chemical lifetime of NO, is always short, but
varies widely throughout the troposphere, being | day or less in
the polluted boundary layer, day or night, and 5 to 10 days in the
upper troposphere. As with VOC, it is not possible to derive a
global burden or average abundance for NO, from measurements

of atmospheric abundances.

There is a serious discrepancy between the isoprene
emissions derived by Guenther er al. (1995) based on a global
scaling of emission from different biomes, about 500 TgC/yr,
and those used in OxComp for global chemistry-transport
modelling, about 200 TgC/yr. When the larger isoprene fluxes
are used in the CTMs, many observational constraints on CO
and even isoprene itself are poorly matched. This highlights a
key uncertainty in global modelling of highly reactive trace
gases: namely, what fraction of primary emissions escapes
immediate reaction/removal in the vegetation canopy or
immediate boundary layer and participates in the chemistry on
the scales represented by global models? For the isoprene
budget, there are no measurements of the deposition of reaction
products within the canopy. More detail on the scaling of
isoprene and monoterpene emissions is provided in Chapter 5.
Although isoprene emissions are likely to change in response to
evolving chemical and climate environment over the next
century, this assessment was unable to include a projection of
such changes.

"Most tropospheric NO, are emitted as NO, which
photochemically equilibrates with nitrogen dioxide (NO}) within
a few minutes. Significant sources, summarised in Table 4.8,
include both surface and in situ emissions, and only a small
amount is transported down from the stratosphere. NO, emitted
within polluted regions are more rapidly removed than those in
remote regions. Emissions directly into the free troposphere have
a disproportionately large impact on global greenhouse gases.
The major source of NO, is fossil fuel combustion, with 40%
coming from the transportation sector. Benkovitz et al. (1996)
estimated global emissions at 21 TgN/yr for 1985. The NO,
emissions from fossil fuel use used in model studies here for year
2000 are considerably higher, namely 33 TgN/yr. The large
American and European emissions are relatively stable, but
emissions from East Asia are increasing by about +4%/yr (Kato
and Akimoto, 1992). Other important, but more uncertain surface
sources are biomass burning and soil emissions. The soil source
recently derived from a bottom-up compilation of over 100
measurements from various ecosystems is 21 TgN/yr (Davidson
and Kingerlee, 1997), much higher than earlier estimates. Part of
the discrepancy can be explained by the trapping of soil-emitted
NO in the vegetation canopy. Inclusion of canopy scavenging
reduces the NO, flux to the free troposphere to 13 TgN/yr,
which is still twice the flux estimated by another recent study
(Yienger and Levy, 1995). Emissions of NO, in the free
troposphere include NO, from aircraft (8 to 12 km), ammonia
oxidation, and lightning (Lee er al., 1997). Estimates of the
lightning NO, source are quite variable; some recent global
estimates are 12 TgN/yr (Price et al., 1997a,b), while other
studies recommend 3 to 5 TgN/yr (e.g., Huntrieser et al., 1998;
Wang et al., 1998a). Recent studies indicate that the global
lightning frequency may be lower than previously estimated
(Christian et al., 1999) but that intra-cloud lightning may be
much more effective at producing NO (DeCaria et al., 2000). In
total, anthropogenic NO, emissions dominate natural sources,
with fossil fuel combustion concentrated in northern industrial
regions. However, natural sources may control a larger fraction of
the globe. Overall, anthropogenic NO, emissions are expected to

The dominant sink of NO, is atmospheric oxidation of NO,
by OH to form nitric acid (HNO3), which then collects on
aerosols or dissolves in precipitation and is subsequently
scavenged by rainfall. Other pathways for direct NO, removal
occur through canopy scavenging of NO, and direct, dry deposi-
tion of NO,, HNO, and particulate nitrates to the land surface
and the ocean. Dry deposition can influence the surface
exchanges and can thus alter the release of NO, and N,O to the
atmosphere. Peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), formed by the reaction
of CH3C(O)O) with NO,, can transport HO, and NO, to remote
regions of the atmosphere due to its stability at the cold tempera-
tures of the upper troposphere. In addition tropospheric aerosols
provide surfaces on which reactive nitrogen, in the form of NO;
(nitrate radical) or NjOs, is converted to HNO; (Dentener and
Crutzen, 1993; Jacob, 2000).

current burden of tropospheric O3 is about 370 Tg(O3), which is
equivalent to a globally averaged column density of 34 DU
(Dobson Units, 1 DU = 2.687 < 10!° molecules/em”) or a mean

conditions would give about +4 DU global increase in tropospheric O, alone (see Table 4.11).

‘ Early observations are difficult to interpret and do not provide coverage needed to derive the tropospheric burden of O; (see Harris et al.,
1997). The change in burden is derived here by shifting tropospheric O; uniformly in altitude to give 10 ppb at the surface in
Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes and 20 ppb at surface in Northern Hemisphere tropics (implies 10 DU), or by additionally reducing
Southern Hemisphere tropics to 20 ppb and Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes to 25 ppb at the surface (13 DU).

"The sources and sinks of tropospheric ozone are even more
difficult to quantify than the burden. Influx of stratospheric air is
a source of about 475 Tg(O;)/yr based on observed correlations
with other gases (Murphy and Fahey, 1994; McLinden et al.,
2000). The in situ photochemical sources are predicted to be
many times larger, but are nearly balanced by equally large in situ
chemical sinks (see discussion on CTM modelling of tropo-
spheric O; in Sections 4.4 and 4.5, Table 4.12). Photochemical
production of ozone is tied to the abundance of pollutants and
thus varies widely over a range of spatial scales, the most
important of which (e.g., biomass burning plumes, urban plumes,
aircraft corridors, and convective outflows) are not well
represented in most global CTMs and cannot be quantified
globally with regional models. The dominant photochemical
sinks for tropospheric O3 are the catalytic destruction cycle
involving the HO, + O; reaction and photolytic destruction by
pathways involving the reaction of O('D), a product of O3
photodissociation. The other large sink, comparable in magnitude
to the stratospheric source, is surface loss mainly to vegetation.
Another loss of O3 is observed under certain conditions in the
polar marine boundary layer, notably at the end of Arctic winter.
It indicates reactions involving halogen radicals and aerosols
(Oum et al., 1998; Dickerson et al., 1999; Impey ef al., 1999;
Platt and Moortgat, 1999; Prados et al., 1999; Vogt et al., 1999).
The contribution of these processes to the global budget is not yet
quantified, but is probably small.

"Atmospheric measurement campaigns, both at surface sites
and with aircraft, have focused on simultaneous observations of
the many chemical species involved in tropospheric O3 produc-
tion. Primary areas of O; production are the mid-latitude industri-
alised and tropical biomass burning regions. For example, the
North Atlantic Regional Experiment (NARE) and _ the
Atmosphere Ocean Chemistry Experiment (AEROCE) showed
that the prevailing westerly winds typically carry large quantities
of ozone and precursors from the eastern USA over the North
Atlantic, reaching Bermuda and beyond (e.g., Dickerson et al.,
1995; Penkett et al., 1998; Prados et al., 1999). The Pacific
Exploratory Missions (PEM: Hoell et al., 1997, 1999) measured
extensive plumes of pollution including ozone and its precursors
downwind of eastern Asia. Convective transport of emissions
from biomass burning affect the abundance of O; in the mid- and
upper troposphere (Pickering et al., 1996). Emissions by tropical
fires in South America and southern Africa have been identified
as the cause of enhanced O; over the South Atlantic (Thompson
et al., 1996), and the effects of biomass burning were seen in the
remote South Pacific in PEM Tropics A (Schultz et al., 1999;
Talbot et al ., 1999). Due to the widely varying chemical
environments, these extensive studies provide a statistical
sampling of conditions along with a critical test of the
photochemistry in CTM simulations, but they do not provide an
integrated budget for tropospheric O3. An example of such
model-and-measurements study is given in the Section 4.2.6

spheric O; does not reflect the abundance over the surrounding
continent, and a surface measurement is not representative of the
bulk of the troposphere above. Thus it is not contradictory for
decadal trends in different atmospheric regions to be different,
e.g., driven by the regional changes in pollutants, particularly
NO,. Ozone sondes offer the best record of O3 throughout the
troposphere, although measurements at many stations are made
only weekly (infrequently for a variable gas like O3). Weekly
continuous data since 1970 are available from only nine stations
in the latitude range 36°N to 59°N (Logan et al., 1999; WMO,
1999). Different trends are seen at different locations for different
periods. Most stations show an increase from 1970 to 1980, but no
clear trend from 1980 to 1996. A composite record of the mid-
tropospheric O; abundance from 1970 to 1996 from the nine
stations is taken from the analysis of Logan et al. (1999) and
presented in Figure 4.8. There is no obvious linear increase in O;
abundance over this period, although the second half of this record
(about 57 ppb) is clearly greater than the first half (about 53 ppb).
Of the fourteen stations with records since 1980, only two, one in
Japan and one in Europe, had statistically significant increases in
mid-tropospheric O3 between 1980 and 1995. By contrast, the
four Canadian stations, all at high latitudes, had significant
decreases for the same time period. Surface O; measurements
from seventeen background stations also show no clear trend,
even in the northern mid-latitudes (Oltmans er al., 1998; WMO,
1999). The largest negative trend in surface O; was —0.7  0.2%/yr
at the South Pole (1975 to 1997), while the largest positive trend
was +1.5 £ 0.5%/yr at Zugspitze, Germany (1978 to 1995). This
ambiguous record of change over the past two decades may
possibly be reconciled with the model predictions (see Section
4.4) of increasing tropospheric O; driven regionally by increasing
emissions of pollutants: the growth in NO, emissions is expected
to have shifted from North America and Europe to Asia.

Although in polluted regions and in the upper troposphere,
photodissociation of other trace gases such as peroxides, acetone
and formaldehyde (Singh et al., 1995; Arnold et al., 1997) may
provide the dominant source (e.g., Folkins et al., 1997; Prather
and Jacob, 1997; Wennberg er al., 1998; Miiller and Brasseur,
1999). OH reacts with many atmospheric trace gases, in most
cases as the first and rate-determining step of a reaction chain
that leads to more or less complete oxidation of the compound.
These chains often lead to formation of an HO, radical, which
then reacts with O3 or NO to recycle back to OH. Tropospheric
OH is lost through reactions with other radicals, e.g., the
reaction with HO, to form H,O or with NO, to form HNO3. In
addition to providing the primary loss for CH, and other
pollutants, HO, radicals (OH and HO;) together with NO, are
key catalysts in the production of tropospheric O3 (see Section
4.2.3.3). The sources and sinks of OH involve most of the fast

photochemistry of the troposphere.

"Water vapour in the lower stratosphere is a very effective
greenhouse gas. Baseline levels of stratospheric H,O are
controlled by the temperature of the tropical tropopause, a
parameter that changes with climate (Moyer et al., 1996; Rosenlof
et al., 1997; Dessler, 1998; Mote et al., 1998). The oxidation of
CH, is a source of mid-stratospheric HO and currently causes its
abundance to increase from about 3 ppm at the tropopause to about
6 ppm in the upper stratosphere. In addition, future direct
injections of H,O from high-flying aircraft may add HO to the
lower stratosphere (Penner et al., 1999). Oltmans and Hofmann
(1995) report statistically significant increases in lower strato-
spheric H,O above Boulder, Colorado between 1981 and 1994.
The vertical profile and amplitude of these changes do not
correspond quantitatively with that expected from the recognised
anthropogenic sources (CH, oxidation). Analyses of satellite and
ground-based measurements (Nedoluha er al., 1998; Michelsen et
al., 2000) find increases in upper stratospheric H,O from 1985 to
1997, but at rates (>1%/yr) that exceed those from identified
anthropogenic sources (i.e., aviation and methane increases) and
that obviously could not have been maintained over many decades.
In principle such a temporary trend could be caused by a warming
tropopause, but a recent analysis indicates instead a cooling
tropopause (Simmons et al., 1999). It is important to resolve these
apparent discrepancies; since, without a physical basis for this
recent trend, no recommendation can be made here for projecting
changes in lower stratospheric HO over the 21st century.

"The change in tropospheric O3 since the pre-industrial era is
even more difficult to evaluate on the basis of measurements
alone. Since O; is reactive, atmospheric abundances cannot be
retrieved from ice cores. Recent evaluations of surface measure-
ments in the 19th and early 20th century in Europe (Volz and
Kley, 1988; Staehelin et al., 1994, 1998; Harris et al., 1997)
indicate much lower O; abundances than today, yet the scaling of
these data to a tropospheric O3 burden, even for northern mid-
latitudes, is not obvious. In the SAR, these data were used to
make a rough estimate that O3 abundances in the Northern
Hemispheric troposphere have doubled since the pre-industrial
era. A similar difference, of 10 to 13 DU when globally averaged,
is obtained using the climatology given by Park et al. (1999) for
tropospheric O3 today and a parallel one with abundances
adjusted to match the 19th century measurements in the Northern
Hemisphere. CTM calculations predict that current anthro-
pogenic emissions of NO,, CO, and VOC, as well as the increase
in CH, should have increased tropospheric O3 by a similar
amount, primarily in the Northern Hemisphere. A recent survey
of CTM studies gives global average increases ranging from 8 to
12 DU, although this small range does not adequately represent
the uncertainty. These results are summarised in Table 4.9. Based
on measurements, analyses, and models, the most likely increase
in tropospheric O; was 9 DU globally averaged, with a 67%
confidence range of 6 to 13 DU. For some of the emissions
scenarios considered here, tropospheric O3 is expected to
increase even more in the 21st century as emissions of its precur-
sors — NO,, CO and VOC — continue to grow (see Section 4.4).

Atmospheric measurements provide another cornerstone for the
numerical modelling of photochemistry. Over the last five years
direct atmospheric measurements of HO, radicals, made simulta-
neously with the other key species that control HO,, have been
conducted over a wide range of conditions: the upper troposphere
and lower stratosphere (e.g., SPADE, ASHOE/MAESA, STRAT;
SUCCESS, SONEX, PEM-TROPICS A & B), the remote Pacific
(MLOPEX), and the polluted boundary layer and its outflow
(POPCORN, NARE, SOS). These intensive measurement
campaigns provide the first thorough tests of tropospheric OH
chemistry and production of O} for a range of global conditions.
As an example here, we present an analysis of the 1997 SONEX
(Subsonic assessment program Ozone and Nitrogen oxide
EXperiment) aircraft campaign over the North Atlantic that tests
one of the chemical models from the OxComp workshop (HGIS).

"Analysis of the CH3CCl, burden and trend (Prinn er al.,

cornerstone of our empirical derivations of the OH lifetimes of
most gases. Quantification of the “OH-lifetime” of CH3CCl; has
evolved over the past decade. The SAR adopted a value of 5.9 +
0.7 years in calculating the lifetimes of the greenhouse gases.
This range covered the updated analysis of Prinn et al. (1995),

Reaction rate coefficients used in this chapter to calculate
atmospheric lifetimes for gases destroyed by tropospheric OH
are from the 1997 and 2000 NASA/JPL evaluations (DeMore et
al., 1997; Sander et al., 2000) and from Orkin et al. (1999) for
HFE-356mff2. These rate coefficients are sensitive to
atmospheric temperature and can be ten times faster near the
surface than in the upper troposphere. The global mean
abundance of OH cannot be directly measured, but a weighted
average of the OH sink for certain synthetic trace gases (whose
budgets are well established and whose total atmospheric sinks
are essentially controlled by OH) can be derived. The ratio of the
atmospheric lifetimes against tropospheric OH loss for a gas is
scaled to that of CH;CCl, by the inverse ratio of their OH-
reaction rate coefficients at an appropriate scaling temperature.
A new analysis of the modelled global OH distribution predicts
relatively greater abundances at mid-levels in the troposphere
(where it is colder) and results in a new scaling temperature for
the rate coefficients of 272K (Spivakovsky er al., 2000), instead
of 277K (Prather and Spivakovsky, 1990; SAR). The
atmospheric lifetimes reported in Table 4.1 use this approach,
adopting an “OH lifetime” of 5.7 years for CH;CCl, (Prinn et
al., 1995; WMO, 1999). Stratospheric losses for all gases are
taken from published values (Ko er al., 1999; WMO, 1999) or
calculated as 8% of the tropospheric loss (with a minimum
lifetime of 30 years). The only gases in Table 4.1 with surface
losses are CH, (a soil-sink lifetime of 160 years) and CH;CCl,
(an ocean-sink lifetime of 85 years). The lifetime for nitrogen
trifluoride (NF3) is taken from Molina er al. (1995). These
lifetimes agree with the recent compendium of Naik et al.
(2000).

The 1997 SONEX aircraft campaign over er the North Atlantic
provided the first airborne measurements of HO, abundances
concurrent with the controlling chemical background: H,O3,
CH;00H, CH,O, 03, NO,, H,O, acetone and hydrocarbons.
These observations allowed a detailed evaluation of our
understanding of HO, chemistry and O; production in the upper
troposphere. Figure 4.9 (panels 1-3) shows a comparison
between SONEX measurements and model calculations (Jaeglé
et al., 1999) for OH and HO, abundances and the ratio HO,/OH.
At each point the model used the local, simultaneously observe
chemical abundances. The cycling between OH and HO, takes
place on a time-scale of a few seconds and is mainly controlle
by reaction of OH with CO producing HOs, followed by reaction
of HO, with NO producing OH. This cycle also leads to the
production of ozone. As seen in Figure 4.9, the HO,/OH ratio is
reproduced by model calculations to within the combine
uncertainties of observations (+20%) and those from propagation
of rate coefficient errors in the model (+100%), implying that the
photochemical processes driving the cycling between OH an
HO, appear to be understood (Wennberg ef al., 1998; Brune et
al., 1999). The absolute abundances of OH and HO, are matche
by model calculations to within 40% (the reported accuracy 0:
the HO, observations) and the median model-to-observed ratio
for HO, is 1.12. The model captures 80% of the observe
variance in HO,, which is driven by the local variations in NO,
and the HO, sources (Faloona et al., 2000, Jaeglé et al., 2000;).
The predominant sources of HO, during SONEX were reaction
of OCD) with H,O and photodissociation of acetone; the role o!
H,O, and CH,;00H as HO, sources was small. This was not
necessarily the case in some of the other airborne campaigns,
where large differences between measured and modelled OH, up
to a factor of 5, were observed in the upper troposphere. In these
campaigns the larger measured OH concentrations were
tentatively ascribed to enhanced levels of OH precursors, such as
H,0O,, CH;00OH, or CH,0, whose concentrations had not been
measured.

atmospheric conditions (e.g., Ehhalt, 1998). These SONEX
observations indicate, however, that both OH abundance and O3
production may continue to increase with NO, concentrations up
to 1,000 ppt because the high NO, abundances were often associ-
ated with convection and lightning events and occurred simulta-
neously with high HO, sources. By segregating observations
according to HO, source strengths, Jaeglé et al. (1999) identified
the approach to NO,-saturated conditions predicted by the
chemical models when HO, sources remain constant. A NO,-
saturated environment was clearly found for the POPCORN
(Photo-Oxidant formation by Plant emitted Compounds and OH
Radicals in north-eastern Germany) boundary layer measure-
ments in Germany (Rohrer ef al., 1998; Ehhalt and Rohrer, 2000).
The impact of NO,-saturated conditions on the production of O3
is large in the boundary layer, where much of the NO, is removed
within a day, but may be less important in the upper troposphere,
where the local lifetime of NO, is several days and the elevated
abundances of NO, are likely to be transported and diluted to
below saturation levels. This effective reduction of the NO,-
saturation effect due to 3-D atmospheric mixing is seen in the
CTM modelling of aviation NO, emissions where a linear
increase in tropospheric O3; is found, even with large NO,
emissions in the upper troposphere (Isaksen and Jackman, 1999).

"The IPCC SRES (Nakiéenovié et al., 2000) developed 40 future
scenarios that are characterised by distinctly different levels of
population, economic, and technological development. Six of
these scenarios were identified as illustrative scenarios and these
were used for the analyses presented in this chapter. The SRES
scenarios define only the changes in anthropogenic emissions
and not the concurrent changes in natural emissions due either to
direct human activities such as land-use change or to the indirect
impacts of climate change. The annual anthropogenic emissions
for all greenhouse gases, NO,, CO, VOC and SO, (sulphur
dioxide) are given in the SRES for the preliminary marker
scenarios (Nakicenovié et al., 2000, Appendix VI) and the final
marker/illustrative scenarios (Nakicenovié et al., 2000, Appendix
VII). Much of these data is also tabulated in Appendix II to this
report. There are insufficient data in the published SRES
(Nakiéenovié et al., 2000) to break down the individual contribu-
tions to HFCs, PFCs, and SF, but these emissions were supplied
by Lead Authors of the SRES (available at sres.ciesin.org) and
are also reproduced in this Appendix. The geographic distribution
of emissions of the short-lived compounds — NO,, CO, VOC, and
SO), — is an important factor in their greenhouse forcing, and the
preliminary gridded emissions were likewise supplied by the
SRES Lead Authors (Tom Kram and Steven Smith, December
1998) and used in the OxComp model studies. A synopsis of the
regional shift in CO and NO, emissions projected by 2100 is

The recently approved six marker/illustrative scenarios
(March 2000) are also evaluated and are designated A1B-AIM,
AIT-MESSAGE, AIFI-MiniCAM, A2-ASF, B1-IMAGE, B2-
MESSAGE (hereafter abbreviated as A1B, AIT, AIFI, A2, B1,
B2). For comparison with the previous assessment, we also
evaluate the IPCC emissions scenario IS92a used in the SAR; for
the full range of IS92 scenarios, see the SAR. An agreed-upon
property of all SRES scenarios is that there is no intervention to
reduce greenhouse gases; but, in contrast, regional controls on
SO, emissions across the illustrative SRES scenarios lead to
emissions in the last two decades of the century that are well
below those of 1990 levels. There appear to be few controls on
NO,, CO and VOC emissions across all scenarios; however, the
large increases in surface O; abundances implied by these results
may be inconsistent with the SRES storylines that underpin the
emissions scenarios. As understanding of the relationship between
emissions and tropospheric O3 abundances improves, particularly
on regional scales, more consistent emissions scenarios can be
developed. The SRES scenarios project substantial emissions of
HFC-134a as in IS92a, but only half as much HFC-125, and no
emissions of HFC-152a. The SRES emissions scenarios do
include a much larger suite of HFCs plus SF, and PFCs, which are
not included in IS92a. The emissions of greenhouse gases under
the Montreal Protocol and its Amendments (CFCs, HCFCs,
halons) have been evaluated in WMO (Madronich and Velders,
1999). This report adopts the single WMO baseline Montreal
Protocol Scenario Al (no relation to SRES A1) for emissions and
concentrations of these gases, while the SRES adopted a similar
WMO Scenario A3 (maximum production); however, the differ-
ences between scenarios in terms of climate forcing is inconse-
quential. The resulting abundances of greenhouse gases are given
in Appendix II and discussed in Section 4.4.5.

predict how the lifetimes of these gases are changed by an
evolving atmospheric chemistry. This assessment focuses on
predicting changes in the oxidative state of the troposphere,

greenhouse gases). Many research groups have studied and
predicted changes in global tropospheric chemistry, and we seek

these simulations are therefore short-lived tropospheric gases:
O03, CO, NO,, VOC, OH and other radicals. Following the GIM
model study (Kanakidou et al., 1999), we use atmospheric
measurement of O3 and CO to test the model simulations of the
current atmosphere. The Y2000 atmosphere was chosen because
of the need for an IPCC baseline, and it does not try to match
conditions over the 1980s and 1990s from which the measure-
ments come. Although the observed trends in tropospheric O3
and CO are not particularly large over this period and thus justify
the present approach, a more thorough comparison of model
results and measurements would need to use the regional distri-
bution of the pollutant emissions for the observation period.

The seasonal cycle of O; in the free troposphere (700, 500,
and 300 hPa) has been observed over the past decade from more
than thirty ozone sonde stations (Logan, 1999), These measure-
ments are compared with the OxComp Y2000 simulations for
Resolute (75°N), Hohenpeissenberg (48°N), Boulder (40°N),
Tateno (36°N), and Hilo (20°N) in Figure 4.10. Surface measure-
ments from Cape Grim (40°S), representative of the marine
boundary layer in southern mid-latitudes, are also compared with
the models in Figure 4.10. With the exception of a few outliers,
the model simulations are within +30% of observed tropospheric
O; abundance, and they generally show a maximum in spring to
early summer as observed, although they often miss the month of
maximum O3. At 300 hPa the large springtime variation at many
stations is due to the influence of stratospheric air that is approx-
imately simulated at Resolute, but, usually overestimated at the
other stations. The CTM simulations in the tropics (Hilo) at 700
to 500 hPa show much greater spread and hence generally worse
agreement with observations. The mean concentration of surface
O; observed at Cape Grim is well matched by most models, but

the seasonality is underestimated.

This assessment, building on these developments, organised
a workshop to compare CTM results for a few, well-constrained
atmospheric simulations. An open invitation, sent out in March
1999 to research groups involved in 3-D global tropospheric
chemistry modelling, invited participation in this report’s assess-
ment of change in tropospheric oxidative state through a model
intercomparison and workshop (OxComp). This workshop is an
IPCC-focused follow-on to the Global Integration and Modelling
(GIM) study (Kanakidou er al., 1999). The infrastructure for
OxComp (ftp site, database, graphics, and scientific support) was
provided by the University of Oslo group, and the workshop
meeting in July 1999 was hosted by the Max Planck Institute for
Meteorology (MPI) Hamburg. Participating models are described
by publications in peer-reviewed literature as summarised in
Table 4.10; all include 3-D global tropospheric chemistry
including NMHC; and assessment results are based on models
returning a sufficient number of OxComp cases. The two goals of
OxComp are (i) to build a consensus on current modelling
capability to predict changes in tropospheric OH and O; and (ii)
to develop a useful parametrization to calculate the greenhouse
gases (including tropospheric O3 but not CO ) using the IPCC
emissions scenarios.

Overall, this comparison with CO and O; observations
shows good simulations by the OxComp models of the global
scale chemical features of the current troposphere as evidenced
by CO and O;; however, the critical NO, chemistry emphasises
variability on much smaller scales, such as biomass burning
plumes and lightning storms, that are not well represented by the
global models. With this large variability and small scales, the
database of NO, measurements needed to provide a test for the

simple linear relationship for the absolute change in tropospheric
O; and the relative change in OH as a function of the CH,
abundance and the emission rates for NO,, for CO, and for VOC.
These two relationships are given in Table 4.11. Since the change
in CH, abundance and other pollutant emissions for Y2100-A2x

from —6 to —25%, and here we adopt a decrease of —16%. Given
the different distributions of the O3 increase from the OxComp

shown in Figure 4.12 (latitude by altitude zonal average
abundance, ppb) and Figure 4.13 (latitude by longitude

abundance occurs near the tropopause at 40°N latitude; yet
some models concentrate this increase in the tropics and
others push it to high latitudes. In terms of column density,
models generally predict large increases along the southern

relative to year 2000. In all scenarios except B1, OH decreases
10% or more by the end of the century, pushing the lifetime of
CH, up from 8.4 years, to 9.2 to 10.0 years. While increasing
emissions of NO, in most of these scenarios increases O3 and
would tend to increase OH (see notes to Table 4.11), the increase
in CH, abundance and the greater CO emissions appear to
dominate, driving OH down. In such an atmosphere, emissions of
CH, and HFCs persist longer with greater greenhouse impact. In
contrast the B1 atmosphere is more readily able to oxidise these
compounds and reduce their impact.

Another major gap in these projections is the lack of global
models coupling the atmospheric changes with biogeochemical
models. There have been studies that tackled individual parts of
the problem, e.g., deposition of reactive N (Holland et al., 1997),
crop damage from O3 (Chameides et al., 1994). Integrated
assessment studies have coupled NO and CH, emission models
with lower dimension or parametrized climate and chemistry
models (e.g., Alcamo, 1994; Holmes and Ellis, 1999; Prinn et al.,
1999). However, the inherent local nature of this coupling, along
with the possible feedbacks through, for example NO and VOC
emissions, point to the need for coupled 3-D global chemistry
and ecosystem models i in these assessments.

ology similar to the SAR: (1) The troposphere is treated as a
single box with a fill-factor for each gas that relates the burden to
the tropospheric mean abundance (e.g., Tg/ppb). (2) The
atmospheric lifetime for each gas is recalculated each year based
on conditions at the beginning of the year and the formulae in
Table 4.11. (Changes in tropospheric OH are used to scale the
lifetimes of CH, and HFCs, and the abundance of N,O is used to
calculate its new lifetime.) (3) The abundance of a gas is

"There are some obvious gaps in these projections where
processes influencing the greenhouse gas abundances have been
omitted. One involves coupling of tropospheric chemistry with
the stratosphere. For one, we did not include the recovery of
stratospheric ozone expected over the next century. The slow
recovery of stratospheric ozone depletion from the halogens will
lead to an increase in the flux of ozone into the troposphere and
also to reduced solar UV in the troposphere, effectively reversing
over the next century what has occurred over the past two
decades. A more important impact on the Y2100 stratosphere,
however, is the response to increases in CH, and N,O projected
by most scenarios (see Hofmann and Pyle, 1999), which in terms
of coupled stratosphere-troposphere chemistry models could be

SRES projections, thereafter to year 2100. CH, continues to rise
in B2, AIFI, and A2 (like IS92a), with abundances reaching
2,970 to 3,730 ppb, in order. For A1B and A1T, CH, peaks in
mid-century at about 2,500 ppb and then falls. For B1, CHy levels
off and eventually falls to 1980-levels by year 2100. N,O
continues to rise in all scenarios, reflecting in part its long
lifetime, and abundances by the end of the century range from
350 to 460 ppb. Most scenarios lead to increases in tropospheric
O3, with scenarios AIFI and A2 projecting the maximum tropos-
pheric O3; burdens of 55 DU by year 2100. This increase of about
60% from today is more than twice the change from pre-
industrial to present. Scenario B1 is alone in projecting an overall
decline in tropospheric O3 over most of the century: the drop to
30 DU is about halfway back to pre-industrial values. HFC-134a,
the HFC with the largest projected abundance, is expected to
reach about 900 ppt by year 2100 for all scenarios except B1.
Likewise by 2100, the abundance of CF, rises to 340 to 400 ppt
in all scenarios except B1. The projected increase in SF, is much
smaller in absolute abundance, reaching about 60 ppt in scenarios
Al and A2. For the major non-CO, greenhouse gases, the SRES
A2 and AIFI increases are similar to, but slightly larger than,
those of [S92a. The SRES mix of lesser greenhouse gases (HFCs,
PFCs, SF,) and their abundances are increased substantially
relative to IS92a. The summed radiative forcings from these
gases plus CO) and aerosols are given in Chapter 6.

Analyses and observations (see Section 4.2.6) continue to test
and improve the chemistry and transport used in the global
CTMs. In terms of the chemistry, recent studies have looked, for
example, at the representation of NMHC chemistry (Houweling
et al. 1998; Wang et al. 1998b), the role of halogens in the O;
budget of the remote marine troposphere, and the acetone source
of upper tropospheric OH (see Sections 4.2.4 and 4.2.6). Most of
these improvements in understanding will eventually become
adopted as standard in the global CTMs, but at this stage, for
example, the role of tropospheric halogen chemistry on the
Y2100 predictions has not been evaluated in the CTMs.

HFCs. In one study of regional NO, emissions and control

Australia and least to those in Scandinavia. Understanding trends
in CO requires knowledge not only of the in situ chemistry of CO

also of how local pollution control has altered the global pattern
of emissions (e.g., Hallock-Waters et al., 1999). These shifts have
been included to some extent in the SRES emissions for year

Convection, as well as urban pollution and biomass burning
plumes, occur on horizontal scales not resolved in global CTMs.
These sub-grid features appear to be important in calculating OH
abundances and O; production for biomass burning emissions
(Pickering et al., 1996; Folkins et al., 1997), for the remote upper
troposphere (Jaeglé et al., 1997; Prather and Jacob, 1997;
Wennberg et al., 1998), and in urban plumes (e.g., Sillman ef al.,
1990). Convection is represented in all CTMs here (e.g., Collins
et al., 1999; Miiller and Brasseur, 1999) but in quite different
ways, and it still involves parametrization of processes occurring
on a sub-grid scale. A substantial element of the differences in
CTM simulations appears to lie with the different representations
of convection and boundary layer transport, particularly for the
short-lived gases such as NO,.

"The observed depletion of stratospheric ozone over the past three
decades, which can be attributed in large part but not in total to the
rise in stratospheric chlorine levels, has been reviewed extensively
in WMO (1999). This depletion has lead to increases in tropo-
spheric UV and hence forces tropospheric OH abundances
upward (Bekki er al., 1994). The total effect of such a change is
not simple and involves the coupled stratosphere-troposphere
chemical system; for example, ozone depletion may also have
reduced the influx of O; from the stratosphere, which would
reduce tropospheric O3 (Karlsdottir et al., 2000) and tend to
reverse the OH trend. Such chemical feedbacks are reviewed as
“climate-chemistry” feedbacks in WMO 1999 (Granier and Shine,
1999). There is insufficient understanding or quantitative
consensus on these effects to be included in this assessment.

"Many processes involving atmospheric chemistry, and the
coupling of atmospheric chemistry with other elements of global
change, have been proposed in the scientific literature. These are
generally based on sound physical and chemical principles, but
unfortunately, there is no consensus on their quantitative role in
atmospheric chemistry on a global scale (e.g., the effects of
clouds on tropospheric ozone: Lelieveld and Crutzen (1990) vs.
Liang and Jacob (1997)), on the magnitude of possible compen-
sating effects (e.g., net settling of HNO; on cloud particles:
Lawrence and Crutzen (1999) vs. full cloud-scale dynamics), or
even on how to implement them or whether these are already
effectively included in many of the model calculations. While
many of these processes may be important, there is inadequate
information or consensus to make a quantitative evaluation in this
assessment. This assessment is not a review, and so this section
presents only a few examples of recent publications studying
feedbacks or chemical processes, which are not included, but
which are potentially important in this assessment.

"Over the past decade of assessments, stratospheric O; chemistry
has been closely linked with aerosols, and global models in the
recent WMO assessments have included some treatment of the
stratospheric sulphate layer and polar stratospheric clouds. In the
troposphere, studies have identified mechanisms that couple gas-
phase and aerosol chemistry (Jacob, 2000). Many aerosols are
photochemically formed from trace gases, and at rates that depend
on the oxidative state of the atmosphere. Such processes are often
included in global aerosol models (see Chapter 5). The feedback
of the aerosols on the trace gas chemistry includes a wide range of
processes: conversion of NO, to nitrates, removal of HO,, altering
the UV flux and hence photodissociation rates (e.g., Dickerson et
al., 1997; Jacobson, 1998), and catalysing more exotic reactions
leading to release of NO, or halogen radicals. These processes are
highly sensitive to the properties of the aerosol and the local
chemical environment, and their importance on a global scale is
not yet established. Only the first example above of aerosol
chemistry is generally included in many of the CTMs represented
here; however, the surface area of wet aerosols (that converts NO,
to HNO; via the intermediate species NO; and N,Os) is usually
specified and not interactively calculated. More laboratory and
field research is needed to define the processes so that implemen-
tation in global scale models can evaluate their quantitative impact
on these calculations of greenhouse gases.

tropospheric O; decreases by about 10% in response to a warmer,
more humid climate projected for year 2050 as compared to an

based on NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research)

in tropospheric temperature and HO (Brasseur et al., 1998a) finds

Thunderstorms, and their associated lightning, are a
component of the physical climate system that provides a direct
source of a key chemical species, NOx. The magnitude and distri-
bution of this lightning NO, source controls the magnitude of the
anthropogenic perturbations, e.g., that of aviation NO, emissions
on upper tropospheric O3 (Berntsen and Isaksen, 1999). In spite of
thorough investigations of the vertical distribution of lightning NO,
(Huntrieser et al., 1998; Pickering et al. 1998), uncertainty in the
source strength of lightning NO, cannot be easily derived from
observations (Thakur et al., 1999; Thompson et al., 1999). The link
of lightning with deep convection (Price and Rind, 1992) opens up
the possibility that this source of NO, would vary with climate
change, however, no quantitative evaluation can yet be made.

"An updated survey of global tropospheric ‘CTM studies since the
SAR focuses on the tropospheric O; budget and is reported in
Table 4.12. In this case authors were asked for diagnostics that did
not always appear in publication. The modelled tropospheric O;
abundances generally agree with observations; in most cases the
net budgets are in balance; and yet the individual components vary
greatly. For example, the stratospheric source ranges from 400 to
1,400 Tg/yr, while the surface sink is only slightly more
constrained, 500 to 1,200 Tg/yr. If absolute production is
diagnosed as the reactions of HO, and other peroxy radicals with
NO, then the globally integrated production is calculated to be
very large, 2,300 to 4,300 Tg/yr and is matched by an equally
large sink (see Sections 4.2.3.3 and 4.2.6). The differences
between the flux from the stratosphere and the destruction at the
surface is balanced by the net in situ photochemical production. In
this survey, the net production varies widely, from —800 to +500
Tg/yr, indicating that in some CTMs the troposphere is a large
chemical source and in others a large sink. Nevertheless, the large
differences in the stratospheric source are apparently the driving
force behind whether a model calculates a chemical source or sink
of tropospheric O3. Individual CTM studies of the relative roles of
stratospheric influx versus tropospheric chemistry in determining
the tropospheric O; abundance (e.g., Roelofs and Lelieveld, 1997;
Wang ef al., 1998a; Yienger et al., 1999) will not represent a
consensus until all CTMs develop a more accurate representation
of the stratospheric source consistent with observations (Murphy
and Fahey, 1994).

"Natural emissions of N,O and CH, are currently the dominant
contributors to their respective atmospheric burdens, with terres-
trial emissions greatest in the tropics. Emissions of both of these
gases are clearly driven by changes in physical climate as seen in
the ice-core record (Figure 4. le). Soil N,O emissions are sensitive
to temperature and soil moisture and changes in rates of carbon
and nitrogen cycling (Prinn et al., 1999). Similarly, methane
emissions from wetlands are sensitive to the extent of inundation,
temperature rise, and changes in rates of carbon and nitrogen
cycling. Natural emissions of the pollutants NO,, CO, and VOC
play an important role in production of tropospheric O3 and the
abundance of OH; and these emissions are subject to similar
forcings by both the physical and chemical climates. Terrestrial
and aquatic ecosystems in turn respond to near-surface pollution
(O3, NO , acidic gases and aerosols) and to inadvertent fertilisa-
tion through deposition of reactive nitrogen (often emitted from
the biosphere as NO or NH;). This response can take the form of
die back, reduced growth, or changed species composition
competition that may alter trace gas surface exchange and
ecosystem health and function. The coupling of this feedback
system — between build-up of greenhouse gases, human-induced
climate change, ecosystem responses, trace gas exchange at the
surface, and back to atmospheric composition — has not been
evaluated in this assessment. The variety and complexity of these
feedbacks relating to ecosystems, beyond simple increases with
rising temperatures and changing precipitation, argues strongly
for the full interactive coupling of biogeochemical models of trace
gas emissions with chemistry and climate models.

Under some emission scenarios, the large increases in tropo-
spheric O; combined with the decreases in OH may alter the
oxidation rate and the degradation paths for hydrocarbons and
other hazardous substances. The damage caused by higher O;
levels to both crops and natural systems needs to be assessed, and
societal responses to this threat would likely change the emissions
scenarios evaluated here (e.g., the current SRES scenarios antici-
pate the societal demand to control urban aerosols and acid rain by

"the industrialised continents of the Northern Hemisphere are
about 40 ppb with 2000 emissions; and under SRES scenarios A2
and A1FI they would reach 45 to 50 ppb with 2030 emissions, 60
ppb with 2060 emissions, and >70 ppb with 2100 emissions.
Since regional ozone episodes start with these background levels
and build upon them with local smog production, it may be
impossible under these circumstances to achieve a clean-air
standard of <80 ppb over most populated regions. This problem
reaches across continental boundaries and couples emissions of
NO, on a hemispheric scale. In the 21st century a global perspec-
tive will be needed to meet regional air quality objectives. The
impact of this threatened degradation of air quality upon societal
behaviour and policy decisions will possibly change the balance
of future emissions impacting climate change (e.g., more fuel burn

The impact of metropolitan pollution, specifically O3 and CO,
on the background air of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans has been
highlighted by many studies over the past decade. These have
ranged from observations of anthropogenic pollution reaching
across the Northern Hemisphere (e.g., Parrish et al., 1993; Jaffe et
al., 1999) to analyses of rapidly increasing emissions of pollutants
(NO,, CO, VOC) in, for example, East Asia (Kato and Akimoto
1992; Elliott et al., 1997). CTM studies have tried to quantify some
of these projections for the near term: Berntsen et al. (1999) predict
notable increases in CO and O; coming into the north-west USA
from a doubling of current Asian emissions; Jacob et al. (1999)
calculate that monthly mean O; abundances over the USA will
increase by | to 6 ppb from a tripling of these emissions between
1985 and 2010; and Collins et al. (2000) project a 3 ppb increase
from 1990 to 2015 in monthly mean Oj over north-west Europe
due to rising North American emissions. The impact of metropol-
itan pollution will expand over the coming decades as urban areas
grow and use of resources intensifies.

The size distribution of aerosols is critical to all climate
influences. Sub-micrometre aerosols scatter more light per unit
mass and have a longer atmospheric lifetime than larger aerosols.
The number of cloud condensation nuclei per mass of aerosol
also depends on the chemical composition of aerosols as a
function of size. Therefore, it is essential to understand the
processes that determine these properties.

"A model intercomparison was carried out as part of preparation
for this assessment. All participating models simulated surface
mass concentrations of non-sea-salt sulphate to within 50% of
observations at most locations. Whereas sulphate aerosol models
are now commonplace and reasonably well-tested, models of
both organic and black carbon aerosol species are in early stages
of development. They are not well-tested because there are few
reliable measurements of black carbon or organic aerosols.

Although there are quite large spreads between the
individual short-term observed and model-predicted concentra-
tions at individual surface stations (in particular for carbonaceous
aerosols), the calculated global burdens for most models agree to
within a factor of 2.5 for sulphate, organics, and black carbon.
The model-calculated range increases to three and to five for dust
and sea salt with diameters less than 2 um, respectively. The
range for sea salt increases to a factor of six when different
present day surface wind data sets are used.

The vertical distribution of aerosol concentrations differs
substantially from one model to the next, especially for
components other than sulphate. For summertime tropopause
conditions the range of model predictions is a factor of five for
sulphate. The range of predicted concentrations is even larger for
some of the other aerosol species. However, there are insufficient
data to evaluate this aspect of the models. It will be important to
narrow the uncertainties associated with this aspect of models in
order to improve the assessment of aircraft effects, for example.

"Aerosols are liquid or solid particles suspended in the air. They
have a direct radiative forcing because they scatter and absorb
solar and infrared radiation in the atmosphere. Aerosols also alter
warm, ice and mixed-phase cloud formation processes by
increasing droplet number concentrations and ice particle
concentrations. They decrease the precipitation efficiency of
warm clouds and thereby cause an indirect radiative forcing
associated with these changes in cloud properties. Aerosols have
most likely made a significant negative contribution to the overall
radiative forcing. An important characteristic of aerosols is that
they have short atmospheric lifetimes and therefore cannot be
considered simply as a long-term offset to the warming influence
of greenhouse gases.

"For this analysis the central value for the forcing was estimated
using the two-stream radiative transfer equation for a simple box
model. Central values for all parameters were used and error
propagation was handled by a standard Taylor expansion.
Estimates of uncertainty associated with each parameter were
developed from a combination of literature estimates for
emissions, model results for determination of burdens, and
atmospheric measurements for determination of mass scattering
and absorption coefficients and water uptake effects. While such
a simple approach has shortcomings (e.g., it tacitly assumes both
horizontal and vertical homogeneity in such quantities as relative
humidity, or at least that mean values can well represent the
actual distributions), it allows a specific association of parameter

sulphate aerosols due to the high altitude of the emissions, resulting
in low SOQ, losses to dry deposition and a long aerosol lifetime.
Modelled dust concentrations are systematically too high in the
Southern Hemisphere, indicating that source strengths developed
for the Sahara do not accurately predict dust uplift in other arid
areas. Owing to a sensitive, non-linear dependence on wind speed
of the flux of sea salt from ocean to atmosphere, estimates of global
sea salt emissions from two present day estimates of wind speed
differed by 55%. The two available inventories of black carbon

of source estimates for organic aerosol species has not been
assessed, but organic species are believed to contribute signifi-
cantly to both direct and indirect radiative forcing. Aerosol nitrate
is regionally important but its global impact is uncertain.

using the two stream radiative transfer equation for a simple box
model. Central values for all parameters were used and error
propagation was handled as for the estimate of direct forcing
uncertainty. This estimate is less quantitative than that for direct
forcing because it is still difficult to estimate many of the para-
meters and the 2/3 uncertainty ranges are not firm. Moreover,
several sources of uncertainty could not be estimated or included
in the analysis. With this approach, the most important uncertain-
ties are the determination of cloud liquid-water content and
vertical extent. The relationship between sulphate aerosol
concentration (with the propagated uncertainties from the burden
calculation and emissions) and cloud droplet number concentra-

"The radiative forcing of aerosols through their effect on liquid-
water clouds consists of two parts: the 1‘ indirect effect (increase
in droplet number associated with increases in aerosols) and the
2""4 indirect effect (decrease in precipitation efficiency associated
with increases in aerosols). The 1‘! indirect effect has strong
observational support. This includes a recent study that
established a link between changes in aerosols, cloud droplet
number and cloud albedo (optical depth). There is also clear
observational evidence for an effect of aerosols on precipitation
efficiency. However, there is only limited support for an effect of
changes in precipitation efficiency on cloud albedo. Models
which include the second indirect effect find that it increases the
overall indirect forcing by a factor of from 1.25 to more than a
factor of two. Precipitation changes could be important to climate
change even if their net radiative effect is small, but our ability to
assess the changes in precipitation patterns due to aerosols is
limited.

"Considerable progress in understanding the effects of aerosols on

IPCC WGI Second Assessment Report (IPCC, 1996) (hereafter
SAR). A variety of field studies have taken place, providing both
process-level understanding and a descriptive understanding of
the aerosols in different regions. In addition, a variety of aerosol

regional differences in aerosol characteristics. Improved instru-

The quantification of indirect radiative forcing by aerosols is
especially difficult. In addition to the variability in aerosol
concentrations, some quite complicated aerosol influences on
cloud processes must be accurately modelled. The warm (liquid-
water) cloud indirect forcing may be divided into two
components. The first indirect forcing is associated with the
change in droplet concentration caused by increases in aerosol
cloud condensation nuclei. The second indirect forcing is associ-
ated with the change in precipitation efficiency that results from
a change in droplet number concentration. Quantification of the
latter forcing necessitates understanding of a change in cloud
liquid-water content and cloud amount. In addition to warm
clouds, ice clouds may also be affected by aerosols.

"The radiatively important properties of atmospheric aerosols
(both direct and indirect) are determined at the most
fundamental level by the aerosol composition and size distribu-
tion. However, for purposes of the direct radiative forcing
calculation and for assessment of uncertainties, these properties
can be subsumed into a small set of parameters. Knowledge of a
set of four quantities as a function of wavelength is necessary to
translate aerosol burdens into first aerosol optical depths, and
then a radiative perturbation: the mass light-scattering efficiency
Q.p, the functional dependence of light-scattering on relative
humidity f(RH), the single-scattering albedo @,, and the
asymmetry parameter g (cf., Charlson et al., 1992; Penner et al.,

The quantification of aerosol radiative forcing is more
complex than the quantification of radiative forcing by
greenhouse gases because aerosol mass and particle number
concentrations are highly variable in space and time. This
variability is largely due to the much shorter atmospheric lifetime
of aerosols compared with the important greenhouse gases.
Spatially and temporally resolved information on the
atmospheric burden and radiative properties of aerosols is needed
to estimate radiative forcing. Important parameters are size
distribution, change in size with relative humidity, complex
refractive index, and solubility of aerosol particles. Estimating
radiative forcing also requires an ability to distinguish natural and
anthropogenic aerosols.

Aerosols in the accumulation mode, ie., those with dry
diameters between 0.1 and 1 um (Schwartz, 1996) are of most
importance. These aerosols can hydrate to diameters between 0.1
and 2 um where their mass extinction efficiency is largest (see
Figure 5.1). Accumulation mode aerosols not only have high
scattering efficiency, they also have the longest atmospheric
lifetime: smaller particles coagulate more quickly while
nucleation to cloud drops or impaction onto the surface removes
larger particles efficiently. Accumulation mode aerosols form the
majority of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Hence, anthro-
pogenic aerosol perturbations such as sulphur emissions have the
greatest climate impact when, as is often the case, they produce
or affect accumulation mode aerosols (Jones et al., 1994).

"Light scattering by aerosols is measurable as well as
calculable from measured aerosol size and composition. This
permits comparisons, called closure studies, of the different
measurements for consistency. An example is the comparison of
the derived optical depth with directly measured or inferred
optical depths from sunphotometers or satellite radiometers.
Indeed, various sorts of closure studies have been successfully
conducted and lend added credibility to the measurements of the
individual quantities (e.g., McMurry et al., 1996; Clarke er al.,
1996; Hegg er al., 1997; Quinn and Coffman, 1998; Wenny et

Another complication comes from the way in which
different chemical species are mixed in aerosols (e.g., Li and
Okada, 1999). Radiative properties can change depending on
whether different chemicals are in the same particles (internal
mixtures) or different particles (external mixtures). Also,
combining species may produce different aerosol size distribu-

independently. One example is the interaction of sulphate with

To assess uncertainties associated with the basic aerosol

crude geographic/aerosol type differentiation. The values for the
size distribution parameters given in the table were derived from
the references to the table. The mass scattering efficiency and
upscatter fraction shown in the table are derived from Mie
calculations for spherical particles using these size distributions
and a constant index of refraction for the accumulation mode.
The scattering efficiency dependence on relative humidity (RH)
and the single-scattering albedo were derived from the literature
review of measurements.

"The direct radiative effect of aerosols is also very sensitive to
the single scattering albedo @,. For example, a change in @, from
0.9 to 0.8 can often change the sign of the direct effect, depending
on the albedo of the underlying surface and the altitude of the
aerosols (Hansen et al., 1997). Unfortunately, it is difficult to
measure @, accurately. The mass of black carbon on a filter can
be converted to light absorption, but the conversion depends on
the size and mixing state of the black carbon with the rest of the
aerosols. The mass measurements are themselves difficult, as
discussed in Section 5.2.2.4. Aerosol light absorption can also be
measured as the difference in light extinction and scattering. Very
careful calibrations are required because the absorption is often a
difference between two large numbers. As discussed in Section
5.2.4, it is difficult to retrieve @, from satellite data. Well-
calibrated sunphotometers can derive @, by comparing light
scattering measured away from the Sun with direct Sun extinc-
tion measurements (Dubovik et al., 1998).

"Fortunately, studies of the effects of mixing different refrac-
tive indices have yielded a fairly straightforward message: the
type of mixing is usually significant only for absorbing material
(Tang, 1996; Abdou ef al., 1997; Fassi-Fihri et al., 1997). For
non-absorbing aerosols, an average refractive index appropriate
to the chemical composition at a given place and time is
adequate. On the other hand, black carbon can absorb up to twice
as much light when present as inclusions in scattering particles
such as ammonium sulphate compared with separate particles
(Ackerman and Toon, 1981; Horvath, 1993; Fuller et al., 1999).
Models of present day aerosols often implicitly include this effect
by using empirically determined light absorption coefficients but
future efforts will need to explicitly consider how black carbon is
mixed with other aerosols. Uncertainties in the way absorbing
aerosols are mixed may introduce a range of a factor of two in the
magnitude of forcing by black carbon (Haywood and Shine,
1995; Jacobson, » 2000).

sea salt) consist of particles whose physical properties, such as
size and refractive index, have wide ranges. Since the
atmospheric lifetimes and radiative effect of particles strongly
depend on these properties, it makes little sense to provide a

"While the accumulation mode is generally thought to
dominate light scattering, recent studies — as discussed below —
have suggested that sea salt and dust can play a large role under
certain conditions. To include this possibility, a sea salt mode has
been added to the Pacific marine accumulation mode. The salt
mode extends well into the accumulation size range and is consis-
tent with O’ Dowd and Smith (1993). It is optically very important
at wind speeds above 7 to 10 ms7!. For the case shown in the table,
the sea salt mode accounts for about 50% of the local light
scattering and could contribute over a third of the column optical
depth, depending on assumptions about the scale height of the salt.
Similarly, a soil dust coarse mode based on work by Whitby
(1978) was added to the continental background accumulation
mode. When present, this mode often dominates light scattering
but, except for regions dominated by frequent dust outbreaks, is
usually present over so small a vertical depth that its contribution
to the column optical depth is generally slight. The importance of
these coarse modes points to the importance of using size-
resolved salt and dust fluxes such as those given in this report.

atmospheric lifetimes. Thus, as for dust, it is necessary to analyse

The atmospheric lifetime of dust depends on particle size;
large particles are quickly removed from the atmosphere by
gravitational settling, while sub-micron sized particles can have
atmospheric lifetimes of several weeks. A number of models of

atmospheric dust load originates from disturbed soil surfaces, and
should therefore be considered anthropogenic in origin (Tegen

uncertain. Furthermore, dust deflation can change in response to
naturally occurring climate modes. For example, Saharan dust
transport to Barbados increases during El Nifio years (Prospero
and Nees, 1986), and dust export to the Mediterranean and the
North Atlantic is correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation
(Moulin et al., 1997). Analysis of dust storm records shows
regions with both increases and decreases in dust storm
frequency over the last several decades (Goudie and Middleton,

"Sea salt aerosols are generated by various physical processes,
especially the bursting of entrained air bubbles during whitecap
formation (Blanchard, 1983; Monahan er al., 1986), resulting in
a strong dependence on wind speed. This aerosol may be the
dominant contributor to both light scattering and cloud nuclei in
those regions of the marine atmosphere where wind speeds are
high and/or other aerosol sources are weak (O’ Dowd et al., 1997;
Murphy ef al., 1998a; Quinn et al., 1998). Sea salt particles are
very efficient CCN, and therefore characterisation of their surface
production is of major importance for aerosol indirect effects. For
example, Feingold et al. (1999a) showed that in concentrations of
1 particle per litre, giant salt particles are able to modify strato-
cumulus drizzle production and cloud albedo significantly.

Given their importance, measurements of black carbon, and
the differentiation between black and organic carbon, still
require improvement (Heintzenberg et al., 1997). Thermal
methods measure the amount of carbon evolved from a filter
sample as a function of temperature. Care must be taken to avoid
errors due to pyrolysis of organics and interference from other
species in the aerosol (Reid et al., 1998a; Martins et al., 1998).
Other black carbon measurements use the light absorption of
aerosol on a filter measured either in transmission or reflection.
However, calibrations for converting the change in absorption to
black carbon are not universally applicable (Liousse et al.,
1993). In part because of these issues, considerable uncertainties
persist regarding the source strengths of light-absorbing aerosols
(Bond et al., 1998).

Transportation, coal combustion, cement manufacturing,
metallurgy, and waste incineration are among the industrial and
technical activities that produce primary aerosol particles.
Recent estimates for the current emission of these aerosols range
from about 100 Tg/yr (Andreae, 1995) to about 200 Tg/yr (Wolf
and Hidy, 1997). These aerosol sources are responsible for the
most conspicuous impact of anthropogenic aerosols on environ-
mental quality, and have been widely monitored and regulated.
As a result, the emission of industrial dust aerosols has been
reduced significantly, particularly in developed countries.
Considering the source strength and the fact that much industrial
dust is present in a size fraction that is not optically very active
(>1 um diameter), it is probably not of climatic importance at
present. On the other hand, growing industrialisation without
stringent emission controls, especially in Asia, may lead to
increases in this source to values above 300 Tg/yr by 2040 (Wolf
and Hidy, 1997).

Carbonaceous compounds make up a large but highly variable
fraction of the atmospheric aerosol (for definitions see
Glossary). Organics are the largest single component of biomass
burning aerosols (Andreae et al., 1988; Cachier et al., 1995;
Artaxo et al., 1998a). Measurements over the Atlantic in the
haze plume from the United States indicated that aerosol
organics scattered at least as much light as sulphate (Hegg et al.,
1997; Novakov et al., 1997). Organics are also important
constituents, perhaps even a majority, of upper-tropospheric
aerosols (Murphy ef al., 1998b). The presence of polar
functional groups, particularly carboxylic and dicarboxylic
acids, makes many of the organic compounds in aerosols water-
soluble and allows them to participate in cloud droplet
nucleation (Saxena ef al., 1995; Saxena and Hildemann, 1996;
Sempéré and Kawamura, 1996). Recent field measurements
have confirmed that organic aerosols may be efficient cloud
nuclei and consequently play an important role for the indirect
climate effect as s well (Rivera- -Carpio et al. 1996).

"Carbonaceous aerosols from Jossul Juel and biomass combustion
The main sources for carbonaceous aerosols are biomass and
fossil fuel burning, and the atmospheric oxidation of biogenic
and anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (VOC). In this
section, we discuss that fraction of the carbonaceous aerosol
which originates from biomass or fossil fuel combustion and is
present predominantly in the sub-micron size fraction (Echalar et
al., 1998; Cooke, et al., 1999). The global emission of organic
aerosol from biomass and fossil fuel burning has been estimated
at 45 to 80 and 10 to 30 Tg/yr, respectively (Liousse, et al., 1996;
Cooke, et al., 1999; Scholes and Andreae, 2000). Combustion
processes are the dominant source for black carbon; recent
estimates place the global emissions from biomass burning at 6
to 9 Tg/yr and from fossil fuel burning at 6 to 8 Tg/yr (Penner et
al., 1993; Cooke and Wilson, 1996; Liousse et al., 1996; Cooke
et al., 1999, Scholes and Andreae, 2000; see Table 5.3). A recent
study by Bond et al. (1998), in which a different technique for the
determination of black carbon emissions was used, suggests
significantly lower emissions. Not enough measurements are
available at the present time, however, to provide an independent
estimate based on this technique. The source distributions are
shown in Figures 5.2(c) and 5.2(e) for organic and black carbon,
respectively.

Vali, 1976). They may, therefore, be of importance for both direct

Anthropogenic VOC can also be oxidised to organic particu-
late matter. Only the oxidation of aromatic compounds, however,
yields significant amounts of aerosol, typically about 30 g of
particulate matter for 1 kg of aromatic compounds oxidised under
urban conditions (Odum ef al., 1996). The global emission of
anthropogenic VOC has been estimated at 109 + 27 Tg/yr, of
which about 60% is attributable to fossil fuel use and the rest to
biomass burning (Piccot et al., 1992). The emission of aromatics
amounts to about 19 + 5 Tg/yr, of which 12 + 3 Tg/yr is related
to fossil fuel use. Using these data, we obtain a very small source
strength for this aerosol type, about 0.6 + 0.3 Tg/yr.

it is formed by gas-to-particle conversion, this secondary organic

in their global study of carbonaceous aerosols; they employed a
constant aerosol yield of 5% for all terpenes. Based on smog
chamber data and an aerosol-producing VOC emissions rate of

Primary biogenic aerosol consists of plant debris (cuticular
waxes, leaf fragments, etc.), humic matter, and microbial
particles (bacteria, fungi, viruses, algae, pollen, spores, etc.).
Unfortunately, little information is available that would allow a
reliable estimate of the contribution of primary biogenic particles
to the atmospheric aerosol. In an urban, temperate setting,
Matthias-Maser and Jaenicke (1995) have found concentrations
of 10 to 30% of the total aerosol volume in both the sub-micron
and super-micron size fractions. Their contribution in densely
vegetated regions, particularly the moist tropics, could be even
more significant. This view is supported by analyses of the lipid

Recent analyses based on improved knowledge of reaction
pathways and non-methane hydrocarbon source inventories have
led to substantial downward revisions of this estimate. The total
global emissions of monoterpenes and other reactive volatile
organic compounds (ORVOC) have been estimated by
ecosystem (Guenther ef al., 1995). By determining the predom-
inant plant types associated with these ecosystems and identi-
fying and quantifying the specific monoterpene and ORVOC
emissions from these plants, the contributions of individual

most of the presently available studies. A recent analysis suggests

Experiments investigating the aerosol-forming potentials of
biogenic compounds have shown that aerosol production yields
depend on the oxidation mechanism. In general, oxidation by O;
or NO; individually yields more aerosol than oxidation by OH
(Hoffmann, et al., 1997; Griffin, et al., 1999a). However,
because of the low concentrations of NO; and O; outside of
polluted areas, on a global scale most VOC oxidation occurs
through reaction with OH. The subsequent condensation of
organic compounds onto aerosols is a function not only of the
vapour pressure of the various molecules and the ambient
temperature, but also the presence of other aerosol organics that
can absorb products from gas-phase hydrocarbon oxidation
(Odum et al., 1996; Hoffmann er al. 1997, Griffin et al., 1999a).

It should be noted that while the precursors of this aerosol
are indeed of natural origin, the dependence of aerosol yield on
the oxidation mechanism implies that aerosol production from
biogenic emissions might be influenced by human activities.
Anthropogenic emissions, especially of NO,, are causing an
increase in the amounts of O3 and NO,, resulting in a possible 3-
to 4-fold increase of biogenic organic aerosol production since
pre-industrial times (Kanakidou ef al., 2000). Recent studies in
Amazonia confirm low aerosol yields and little production of
new particles from VOC oxidation under unpolluted conditions
(Artaxo et al., 1998b; Roberts et al., 1998). Given the vast
amount of VOC emitted in the humid tropics, a large increase in
SOA production could be expected from increasing development
and anthropogenic emissions in this region.

Two types of. chemical interaction have recently been
recognised that can reduce the radiative impact of sulphate by
causing some of it to condense onto larger particles with lower
scattering efficiencies and shorter atmospheric lifetimes. The first
is heterogeneous reactions of SO, on mineral aerosols (Andreae
and Crutzen, 1997; Li-Jones and Prospero, 1998; Zhang and
Carmichael, 1999). The second is oxidation of SO, to sulphate in
sea salt-containing cloud droplets and deliquesced sea salt
aerosols. This process can result in a substantial fraction of non-
sea-salt sulphate to be present on large sea salt particles,
especially under conditions where the rate of photochemical
H,SO, production is low and the amount of sea salt aerosol
surface available is high (Sievering ef al., 1992; O’ Dowd, et al.,

Estimating the emission of marine biogenic DMS requires a
gridded database on its concentration in surface sea water and a
parametrization of the sea/air gas transfer process. A 1°x1°
monthly data set of DMS in surface water has been obtained from
some 16,000 observations using a heuristic interpolation scheme
(Kettle et al., 1999). Estimates for data-sparse regions are
generated by assuming similarity to comparable biogeographic
regions with adequate data coverage. Consequently, while the
global mean surface DMS concentration is quite robust because
of the large data set used (error estimate + 50%), the estimates for
specific regions and seasons remain highly uncertain in many
ocean regions where sampling has been sparse (error up to factor
of 5). These uncertainties are compounded with those resulting
from the lack of a generally accepted air/sea flux parametrization.

that aqueous phase oxidation is dominant globally (Table 5.5).
Both processes produce sulphate mostly in sub-micron aerosols
that are efficient light scatterers, but the precise size distribution
of sulphate in aerosols is different for gas phase and aqueous
production. The size distribution of the sulphate formed in the gas
phase process also depends on the interplay between nucleation,
condensation and coagulation. Models that describe this interplay
are in an early stage of development, and, unfortunately, there are
substantial inconsistencies between our theoretical description of
nucleation and condensation and the rates of these processes
inferred from atmospheric measurements (Eisele and McMurry,
1997; Weber et al., 1999). Thus, most models of sulphate aerosol
have simply assumed a size distribution based on present day
measurements. Because there is no general reason that this same
size should have applied in the past or will in the future, this lends
considerable uncertainty to calculations of forcing. Many of the
same issues about nucleation and condensation also apply to
secondary organic aerosols.

This comparison indicates that in addition to uncertainties in
precursor source strengths, which may be ranging from factors of
about 1.3 (SO>) to 2 (DMS), the estimation of the production and
deposition terms of sulphate aerosol introduces an additional
uncertainty of at least a factor of 2 into the prediction of the
sulphate burden. As the relationship between sulphur sources and
resulting sulphate load depends on numerous parameters, the
conversion efficiency must be expected to change with changing

with a much lower precursor source than the model with the

potential of a specific sulphur source to contribute to the global
sulphate burden varies strongly as a function of where and in
what form sulphur is introduced into the atmosphere. SO, from
volcanoes (P=6.0 days) is injected at higher altitudes, and DMS
(P=3.1 days) is not subject to dry deposition and can therefore be
converted to SO, far enough from the ground to avoid large

2.9 days) is released near the ground and therefore much of it is
lost by deposition before oxidation can occur (Feichter et al.,

Forcing due to nitrate aerosol is already important at the
regional scale (ten Brink et al., 1996). Observations and model
results both show that in regions of elevated NO, and NH;
emissions, such as Europe, India, and parts of North America,
NH,NO; aerosol concentrations may be quite high and actually
exceed those of sulphate. This is particularly evident when
aerosol sampling techniques are used that avoid nitrate evapora-

Aerosol nitrate is closely tied to the relative abundances of
ammonium and sulphate. If ammonia is available in excess of the
amount required to neutralise sulphuric acid, nitrate can form
small, radiatively efficient aerosols. In the presence of accumula-
tion-mode sulphuric acid containing aerosols, however, nitric
acid deposits on larger, alkaline mineral or salt particles (Bassett
and Seinfeld, 1984; Murphy and Thomson, 1997; Gard et al.,
1998). Because coarse mode particles are less efficient per unit
mass at scattering light, this process reduces the radiative impact
of nitrate (Yang et al., 1994; Li-Jones and nd Prospero, 1998).

Two components of volcanic emissions are of most significance
for aerosols: primary dust and gaseous sulphur. The estimated
dust flux reported in Jones et al., (1994a) for the1980s ranges
from 4 to 10,000 Tg/yr, with a “best” estimate of 33 Tg/yr
(Andreae, 1995). The lower limit represents continuous eruptive
activity, and is about two orders of magnitude smaller than soil
dust emission. The upper value, on the other hand, is the order of
magnitude of volcanic dust mass emitted during large explosive
eruptions. However, the stratospheric lifetime of these coarse
particles is only about | to 2 months (NASA, 1992), due to the
efficient removal by settling.

cases reach 10%. Graf et al. (1998), on the other hand, have
estimated the fraction of H)S and SO,2- to be about 20% of the
total. Nevertheless, the error made in considering all the emitted
sulphur as SO, is likely to be a small one, since HS oxidises to
SO) in about 2 days in the troposphere or 10 days in the strato-
sphere. Estimates of the emission of sulphur containing species
from quiescent degassing and eruptions range from 7.2 TgS/yr to
14 + 6 TgS/yr (Stoiber et al., 1987; Spiro et al., 1992; Graf et al.,
1997; Andres and Kasgnoc, 1998). These estimates are highly
uncertain because only very few of the potential sources have
ever been measured and the variability between sources and
between different stages of activity of the sources is considerable.

Until recently, nitrate has not been considered in assessments
of the radiative effects of aerosols. Andreae (1995) estimated that
the global burden of ammonium nitrate aerosol from natural and
anthropogenic sources is 0.24 and 0.4 Tg (as NH4NO3), respec-
tively, and that anthropogenic nitrates cause only 2% of the total
direct forcing. Jacobson (2001) derived similar burdens, and
estimated forcing by anthropogenic nitrate to be -0.024 Wm”.
Adams et al. (1999) obtained an even lower value of 0.17 Tg (as
NO;,) for the global nitrate burden. Part of this difference may be
due to the fact that the latter model does not include nitrate
deposition on sea salt aerosols. Another estimate (van Dorland et
al., 1997) suggested that forcing due to ammonium nitrate is
about one tenth of the sulphate forcing. The importance of
aerosol nitrate could increase substantially over the next century,
however. For example, the SRES A2 emissions scenario projects
that NO, emissions will more than triple in that time period while
SO, emissions decline slightly. Assuming increasing agricultural
emissions of ammonia, it is conceivable that direct forcing by
ammonium nitrate could become comparable in magnitude to
that due to sulphate (Adams et al., 2001).

Volcanic emissions sufficiently cataclysmic to penetrate the
stratosphere are rare. Nevertheless, the associated transient
climatic effects are large and trends in the frequency of volcanic
eruptions could lead to important trends in average surface
temperature. The well-documented evolution of the Pinatubo

"In the case of primary aerosols, the largest uncertainties often lie
in the extrapolation of experimentally determined source
strengths to other regions and seasons. This is especially true for
dust, for which many of the observations are for a Saharan

remains uncertain. The non-linear dependence of sea salt aerosol
formation on wind speed creates difficulties in parametrizations
in large-scale models and the vertical profile of sea salt aerosols

Besides the problem of predicting the mass of aerosol
species produced, there is the more complex issue of adequately
describing their physical properties relevant to climate forcing.
Here we would like to highlight that the situation is much better
for models of present day aerosols, which can rely on empirical
data for optical properties, than for predictions of future aerosol
effects. Another issue for optical properties is that the quantity
and sometimes the quality of observational data on single
scattering albedo do not match those available for optical depth.
Perhaps the most important uncertainty in aerosol properties is

"The background amount of stratospheric sulphate is mainly
produced by UV photolysis of organic carbonyl sulphide
forming SO, although the direct contribution of tropospheric
SO, injected in the stratosphere in the tropical tropopause
region is significant for particle formation in the lower strato-
sphere and accounts for about one third of the total stratospheric
sulphate mass (Weisenstein et al., 1997). The observed sulphate
load in the stratosphere is about 0.15 TgS (Kent and
McCormick, 1984) during volcanically quiet periods, and this
accounts for about 15% of the total sulphate (i.e., troposphere +
stratosphere) (see Table 5.6).

The historical record of SO, emissions by erupting
volcanoes shows that over 100 Tg of SO, can be emitted in a
single event, such as the Tambora volcano eruption of 1815
(Stoiber et al., 1987). Such large eruptions have led to strong
transient cooling effects (—0.14 to -0.31°C for eruptions in the
19th and 20th centuries), but historical and instrumental
observations do not indicate any significant trend in the
frequency of highly explosive volcanoes (Robertson ef al.,

influenced climate at decadal and shorter scales, it seems
unlikely that trends in volcanic emissions could have played
any role in establishing a longer-term temperature trend.

Forcing Observational Experiment (TARFOX), the Aerosol
Characterisation Experiment (ACE-1, ACE-2), the Indian Ocean
Experiment (INDOEX), SCAR-B, and monitoring networks
such as AERONET provide essential information about the
chemical and physical properties of aerosols (Novakov ef al.,

importance of mixing and entrainment between the boundary
layer and the free troposphere in determining aerosol properties
over the oceans (e.g. Bates et al., 1998; Johnson et al., 2000).
INDOEX found long-range transport of highly absorbing
aerosol. The importance of absorption was shown by a change in
irradiance at the surface that was two to three times that at the top
of the atmosphere (Satheesh et al., 1999; Podgorny et al., 2000).
TARFOX data also show the importance of black carbon in
calculating broad-band irradiances, and confirm theoretical

"There is considerable common ground between closure
studies (Russell and Heintzenberg, 2000). An important
uncertainty in both mass closure and hygroscopic growth is often
the treatment of organics (e.g. McMurry et al., 1996; Raes et al.,
2000). The sampling of coarse aerosols is often a limitation in
computing scattering from in-situ data (e.g. Ferrare et al., 1998;
Quinn and Coffman, 1998). Black carbon and other light
absorbing aerosols are difficult to treat because of difficulties
both in measuring them (Section 5.2.2.4) and computing their
effects (Section 5.1.2). Layers of dust aerosol pose special
problems because they combine coarse particles, uncertainties in
optical parameters, non-sphericity, and spatial inhomogeneity
(Clarke et al., 1996; Russell and Heintzenberg, 2000). For
example, averaged discrepancies during ACE-2 for derived and
measured scattering coefficients were less than 20% except in
dust layers, where they were about 40% (Collins et al., 2000).
There has been a strong consensus from field studies that surface
measurements of aerosol properties are rarely sufficient for
computations of column properties such as optical depth. Some
common reasons are strong vertical gradients in coarse aerosols
and the transport of continental aerosols in the free troposphere
above a marine boundary layer.

"The regional nature of aerosols makes tropospheric aerosol trends
more difficult to determine than trends in long-lived trace gases.
Moreover, there are few long-term records of tropospheric
aerosols (SAR). Ice cores provide records of species relevant to
aerosols at a few locations. As shown in Figure 5.4, ice cores from
both Greenland and the Alps display the strong anthropogenic
influence of sulphate deposited during this century (Déscher et
al., 1995; Fischer et al., 1998). Carbonaceous aerosols also show
long-term trends (Lavanchy et al., 1999). Sulphate in Antarctic
ice cores shows no such trend (Dai et al., 1995) since its source
in the Southern Hemisphere is primarily natural. Aerosols have
been measured from balloon sondes at Wyoming since 1971. For
the number of aerosols larger than 0.15 [1m, decreasing trends of
—1.8 + 1.4%/yr and —1.6 + 1.8%/yr (90% confidence limits)
were found in the 2.5 to 5 and 5 to 10 km altitude ranges,
respectively (Hofmann, 1993). The total number of particles
increased by 0.7 + 0.1%/yr at Cape Grim from 1977 to 1991 but
the number of particles large enough to nucleate cloud droplets
(CCN) decreased by 1.5 + 0.3%/yr from 1981 to 1991 (Gras,
1995). There are also some long-term data on visibility and
turbidity. For example, summertime visibility in the eastern
United States was worst in the 1970s, which was also a time of
maximum SO), emissions (Husar and Wilson, 1993).

"Indirect forcing by aerosols is broadly defined as the overall
process by which aerosols perturb the Earth-atmosphere radiation
balance by modulation of cloud albedo and cloud amount. It can
be viewed as a series of processes linking various intermediate
variables such as aerosol mass, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN)
concentration, ice nuclei (IN) concentration, water phase
partitioning, cloud optical depth, etc., which connect emissions
of aerosols (or their precursors) to the top of the atmosphere
radiative forcing due to clouds. A schematic of the processes
involved in indirect forcing from this perspective is shown in
Figure 5.5. Rather than attempt to discuss fully all of the
processes shown in Figure 5.5, we concentrate here on a selected
suite of linkages, selected either because significant progress
towards quantification has been made in the last five years, or
because they are vitally important. However, before delving into
these relationships, we present a brief review of the observational
evidence for indirect forcing.

"Observational support for indirect forcing by aerosols derives
from several sources. Considering first remote sensing, satellite
studies of clouds near regions of high SO, emissions have
shown that polluted clouds have higher reflectivity on average
than background clouds (Kuang and Yung, 2000). A study by
Han et al. (1998a) has shown that satellite-retrieved column
cloud drop concentrations in low-level clouds increase substan-

tropical areas where biomass burning is prevalent. Wetzel and
Stowe (1999) showed that there is a statistically significant
correlation of aerosol optical depth with cloud drop effective
radius(feg) (negative correlation) and of aerosol optical depth
with cloud optical depths (positive correlation) for clouds with
optical depths less than 15. Han et al. (1998b), analysing
ISCCP data, found an expected increase in cloud albedo with
decreasing droplet size for all optically thick clouds but an
unexpected decrease in albedo with decreasing droplet size in
optically thinner clouds (t.<15) over marine locations. This

For cirrus clouds, much of both the observational and
theoretical support for indirect forcing by anthropogenic
aerosols has been recently summarised in the report on the
impact of aviation-derived aerosols on clouds (Fahey et al.,
1999). There is a remarkably consistent upward trend in cirrus
fractional cloudiness in areas of high air traffic over the last two
decades observable, in at least broad outline, in both ground-
based and satellite databases (Fahey et al., 1999). The suggested
increase in cirrus cloud cover of about 4% since 1971 is much
larger than can be attributed to linear-shaped contrails, with the
resulting implication that aviation emissions are perturbing high
altitude cloud amount. While purely meteorological trends (i.e.,
increasing upper atmospheric water vapour, changing circulation
patterns) and/or increases associated with surface-based
emissions cannot be excluded as a possible cause for these
trends, these observations are very suggestive of a perturbation
from aviation emissions.

while others have linked seasonal variations in drop concentra-
tions and rg with seasonal variations in CCN (Boers ef al.,
1998). Indeed, recent studies by Rosenfeld (1999, 2000) show a
dramatic impact of aerosols on cloud precipitation efficiency.
Until recently, evidence of the impact of aerosols on cloud
albedo itself has been confined primarily to studies of ship tracks
(e.g., Coakley et al., 1987; Ferek et al., 1998; Ackerman et al.,
2000) although some other types of studies have indeed been
done (e.g., Boers et al., 1998). However, new analyses have not
only identified changes in cloud microstructure due to aerosols
but have associated these changes with increases in cloud albedo
as well. An example of this, from Brenguier er al. (2000), can be
seen in Figure 5.6, which displays measured cloud reflectances
at two wavelengths for clean and polluted clouds examined
during ACE-2. Thus, our understanding has advanced
appreciably since the time of the SAR and these studies leave
little doubt that anthropogenic aerosols have a non-zero impact
on warm cloud radiative forcing. An estimate of the forcing over
oceans (from satellite studies) ranged from —0.7 to -1.7 Wm?
(Nakajima ef al., 2001).

"The impact of CCN on the cloud droplet number concentration
(Ng) can be non-linear. One consequence of this is that the
number of natural CCN can strongly influence the way that CCN
from anthropogenic emissions affect the indirect radiative
forcing. For example, Ghan ef al. (1998) have shown that the
presence of relatively high concentrations of sea salt particles can
lead to increased Ng at lower sulphate concentrations and higher
updraught speeds. Conversely, the Ng are lowered by high salt
concentrations if sulphate concentrations are higher and
updraught speeds are weaker (see also O’Dowd et al. (1999)).
However, it is not clear whether these processes significantly
affect the radiative forcing.

Historically, much of the interest in organics has focused on
the inhibition of CCN activation in cloud by surface-active
organics. Recently, Hansson et al. (1998) found that thick
coatings of either of two insoluble high molecular weight
organics (50 to 100% by mass of tetracosane or of lauric acid)
reduced the hygroscopic growth factor for particles of NaCl. On
the other hand, studies by Shulman et al. (1996), Cruz and Pandis
(1998), and Virkkula et al. (1999) suggest that coatings of organic
acids do not necessarily inhibit the effect of the other species on
the condensation of water. The ability of the hydrophobic coating
to form a complete barrier to the water vapour is a critical aspect
of this issue. It is unlikely that such coatings are common in the
atmosphere.

The wide range of solubilities of the organic species may
help to explain why observations do not always provide a consis-
tent picture of the uptake of water. The water solubility of the
oxygenated organic species tends to decrease with increasing the
carbon number (Saxena and Hildemann, 1996). Shulman er al.
(1996) showed that the cloud activation of organic species with
lower solubilties might be delayed due to the increased time
required for dissolution, and delays of 1-3 seconds have been
observed (Shantz et al., 1999). For a mixture of an inorganic salt
or acid with an organic that is at least slightly soluble, the
presence of the organic may contribute to some reduction in the
critical supersaturation for activation (Corrigan and Novakov,
1999) especially if the organics reduce the surface tension
(Shulman et al. 1996) as demonstrated in natural cloud water
(Facchini et al., 1999).

"soluble gases, such as HNO3, can dissolve into a growing
solution droplet prior to activation in cloud. The addition of this
inorganic substance to the solution can decrease the critical
supersaturation for activation (Kulmula er al., 1993; Laaksonen
et al., 1998). The result is an increase in cloud droplet number but
this is tempered somewhat by an enhanced condensation rate that
contributes to a slight reduction in the cloud supersaturation. The
importance of this effect will depend on the mixing ratio of such
gases relative to the CCN solute concentrations and this has not
been properly evaluated. An important consideration for the
development of the CCN spectrum is the in-cloud oxidation of
SO). Current models indicate that the fraction of secondary
sulphate that is due to SO, oxidation in cloud can be in the range
of 60 to 80% (Table 5.5). While the uncertainty in this estimate
does not greatly impact the model sulphur budgets, it has signif-

forcing (Chuang et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 1999).

"There are two general methods that have been used to relate
changes in N, to changes in aerosol concentrations. The first and
simplest approach uses an empirical relationship that directly
connects some aerosol quantity to Ny. Two such empirical
treatments have been derived. Jones et al. (1994b) used a
relationship between N, and the number concentration of aerosol
particles (N,) above a certain size. This method is appropriate for
the particles that serve as nuclei for cloud droplets in stratiform
cloud, but it can be ambiguous for cumuliform cloud because of
the activation of particles smaller than the threshold of the N,

circumvents the assumptions required in deriving the aerosol

The water-soluble fraction of organic species in aerosols can
be high relative to sulphate (e.g., Li et al., 1996; Zappoli et al.,
1999), and organics may be important sources of CCN in at least
some circumstances (Novakov and Penner, 1993; Rivera-Carpio
et al., 1996). Aerosols from biomass burning are primarily
composed of organics and may act as CCN, but some of their
CCN activity may actually be due to co-resident inorganic
constituents (Van-Dinh et al. 1994; Novakov and Corrigan, 1996;
Leaitch et al., 1996a). Measurements from a forested area
suggest that some of the products of terpene oxidation may serve
as CCN (Leaitch et al., 1999), and Virkkula er al. (1999) found
that particles from pinene oxidation absorbed some water at an
RH of about 84%. Cruz and Pandis (1997) examined the CCN
activity of particles of adipic acid and of glutaric acid (products
of alkene oxidation) and found reasonable agreement with
Kohler theory, whereas Corrigan and Novakov (1999) measured
much higher activation diameters than predicted by theory.
Volatile organic acids (formic, acetic, pyruvic, oxalic) may also
contribute to the formation of CCN in areas covered with vegeta-
tion and in plumes from biomass burning (Yu, 2000). Pésfai et al.
(1998) suggest that organic films can be responsible for relatively
large water uptake at low RH.

relatively close agreement of the 10 cms“! updraught curve with

Further work comparing both the empirical and prognostic

probability distribution function (PDF) of updraughts in these
clouds, but the PDF of those that actually nucleate droplets. No
satisfactory method of parametrizing the local updraught has yet
been devised. The prognostic methods also produce an adiabatic
Ng, which leads to the problem of how to represent the mean Ny

Entrainment can even result from changes in Ng (Boers and

new empirical approach relates Ng to the particle mass concen-
tration and mean volume diameter in the accumulation mode
aerosol. It is based on mass scavenging efficiencies of the
accumulation-mode aerosol by stratiform clouds (Glantz and
Noone, 2000). When deriving empirical relationships, it is
important to be aware of the effects of the averaging scale

methods is that they may account for the effects on Ny that are
associated with cloud dynamics in an average sense. Variance in
the cloud updraught velocities is one of the main reasons for the
large scatter in the observations from which these empirical

The longevity of marine stratiform clouds, a key cloud type
for climate forcing in the lower troposphere, is dictated by a
delicate balance between a number of source and sink terms for
condensed water, including turbulent latent and sensible heat
fluxes from the ocean surface, radiative cooling and heating rates,
entrainment of dry air from above the cloud top inversion, and the
precipitation flux out of the cloud. Unfortunately, changes to
cloud extent induced by plausible changes in cloud droplet
number concentration due to aerosol modulation can be slight
and difficult to characterise (cf., Hignett, 1991). For example,
Pincus and Baker (1994) point out that changes in short-wave
absorption induced by changes in drop number act primarily to
change cloud thickness — and cloud thickness is also strongly
modulated by non-radiative processes. Depending on the cloud
type, feedbacks involving cloud thickness can substantially
reduce or enhance changes in cloud albedo due to change in
droplet concentration (Boers and Mitchell 1994; Pincus and
Baker, 1994). Feingold et al. (1997) have more recently
examined the impact of drizzle modulation by aerosol on cloud
optical depth.

Finally, it is important to note that the impact of anthropogenic

a number of studies have suggested that both natural (e.g., Feingold

Because of these issues, it is premature to quantitatively

assessment. A summary of what is known with respect to these

"One such process is the modulation of cloud optical depth by
precipitation. Pincus and Baker (1994) showed, using a simple

tion upon which the cloud formed, the dependence being close to
exponential. Boers (1995) subsequently demonstrated, through

substantial part of the seasonal cycle in cloud albedo at Cape Grim

The relative roles of different types of ice nucleation in cirrus
clouds is very complex (e.g., Sassen and Dodd, 1988; Heymsfield
and Miloshevich, 1993, 1995; DeMott er al., 1997, 1998; Strom
et al., 1997; Xu et al., 1998; Martin, 1998; Koop er al., 1999).
Presumably there is a temperature-dependent transition from
predominantly heterogeneous nucleation (i.e., initiated at a phase
boundary with a substrate — the heterogeneous nucleus) to
homogeneous nucleation (i.e., within the liquid phase alone — no
substrate required) that depends on the chemistry and size of the
precursor haze drops of the homogeneous process as well as on
the chemistry and concentration of the heterogeneous nuclei.

While the effect of precipitation modulation on cloud
amount is supported by a number of studies, several others have
argued that external thermodynamic factors such as sea surface
temperature (SST) are the main factors determining the
formation and dissipation of marine stratocumulus (cf., Wyant et
al., 1997). Such an analysis is also supported by the relationship
of satellite-derived aerosol number concentration with cloud
droplet number concentration and with liquid-water path. The
former shows a positive correlation while the latter shows no
particular relationship (Nakajima er al., 2001). Thus, the climato-
logical significance of this aspect of the indirect effect needs a
great deal more investigation.

A second important process which may be affected by onset
of precipitation is that of decoupling of the cloud layer from the
surface. Precipitation may sometimes produce a sub-cloud stable
layer that cuts off the moisture flux to the cloud. However,
decoupling is not an inevitable consequence of precipitation
formation and, under some circumstances, a balance between the
moisture flux from the surface and precipitation sinks determine
the cloud extent. Pincus et al. (1997) observed no difference
between precipitating and non-precipitating stratocumulus with
respect to cloud fraction and both Austin et al. (1995) and Stevens
et al. (1998) found that observed stratocumulus seemed able to
maintain themselves despite a considerable precipitation rate.

"Nevertheless, precipitation processes are extremely important
to marine cloud fraction, with varying precipitation efficiency
leading to varying fractional cloudiness and liquid water content
(Albrecht, 1989). The postulated mechanism is as follows. The
activation of a larger number of aerosol particles limits the size to
which drops can grow for an available cooling rate. Hence, the
number of drops which grow large enough to initiate the collision-
coalescence process (the dominant precipitation process in warm
clouds) is decreased and precipitation rates are attenuated. With
precipitation attenuated, a major sink for cloud drops is removed
and cloud lifetime is enhanced. Liou and Cheng (1989) first
estimated the potential global significance of this process. Further
studies with more sophisticated models have supported the signif-
icance of the modulation of precipitation by aerosols and led to the
consideration of several different processes that contribute to the

effects of aerosols on clouds.

"In principle the phase partitioning of water in clouds should have
a substantial impact on cloud radiative forcing, first because the
ice hydrometeors will tend to be much larger than cloud drops
and thus increase precipitation, and second because the size of
hydrometeors (determined by both ice/vapour and ice/liquid
partitioning) can have a significant impact on radiative balances.
Several GCM sensitivity studies have supported these expecta-
tions (e.g., Senior and Mitchell, 1993; Fowler and Randall, 1996)
by demonstrating that the fraction of supercooled water in the
models which is converted to ice has a significant impact on the
global radiative balance. A simple sensitivity study with the
ECHAM model (cf., Lohmann and Feichter, 1997) conducted for
this assessment revealed a very large difference in globally
averaged cloud forcing of +16.9 Wm induced by allowing only
ice in clouds with temperatures below 0°C as compared with
allowing only water in clouds with temperatures above —35°C.
The liquid-water path change in these experiments (160 gm to
54.9 gm”) was larger than the 60% uncertainty in this quantity
from measurements (Greenwald et al., 1993; Weng and Grody,
1994). However, this certainly demonstrates that even small
changes in ice formation could have a significant impact on the
indirect climate forcing due to aerosols.

For ice formation in other lower-tropospheric clouds, the

the soil source alluded to above, biogenic IN have been measured

cirriform clouds, an assertion that the number of ice forming

The impact of anthropogenic emissions could be negative, due to

For lower level, warmer (though still supercooled) clouds, in
principle the answer to our query is necessarily positive. In this
vast, liquid-water reservoir, temperatures are simply too warm for
homogeneous freezing of cloud drops to occur and aerosol
surfaces of some sort must provide the substrate for ice initiation.
However, prolific secondary ice formation due to such processes
as the Hallett-Mossop mechanism renders the establishment of a
clear relationship between measured IN concentrations and ice
particle concentrations quite difficult (cf., Beard, 1992;
Rangno and Hobbs, 1994). Nevertheless, in some instances
relationships between IN concentrations and ice formation in
lower-tropospheric clouds have been found (e.g., Stith et al.,

the actual ice initiation process must be modulated by aerosols.

"For cirrus cloud formed by homogeneous nucleation on haze
particles, there are clearly solid grounds for asserting that there is
a substantive anthropogenic component to the associated IN. Most
chemical transport models (e.g., Penner et al., 1994b; Feichter et
al., 1996; Graf et al., 1997; Koch et al., 1999; Rasch et al., 2000a)
as well as sulphur isotope studies (e.g., Norman ef al., 1999)
suggest that a substantial fraction of the upper-tropospheric
sulphate burden (and thus the sulphate haze droplets involved in
homogeneous nucleation) is anthropogenic although quantitative
estimates vary from model to model. Furthermore, for wintertime
polar clouds, a special case of low-level cirrus, there are observa-
tions and modelling results to indicate that, through suppression of
the freezing point, the acidic aerosols of Arctic haze favour the
formation of large ice crystals rather than the smaller particles in
unpolluted ice fog during the Arctic airmass cooling process. The
larger particles increase the sedimentation flux and deplete water
vapor from the atmosphere, providing a negative forcing
(Blanchet and Girard, 1995). There are also grounds for asserting
that changes in the sulphate abundance will lead to increases in ice
nucleation (cf., Jensen and Toon, 1992, 1994; Karcher et al., 1998;
Lin et al., 1998; Fahey et al. 1999) so that a positive forcing is
plausible. In any case, anthropogenic modulation of ice particles
should certainly be considered.

"Numerous aerosol species of anthropogenic origin have been
identified, both in the laboratory and in the field, as effective ice
initiators (e.g., Hogan, 1967; Langer et al., 1967; Van Valin et al.,
1976). However, measurement of enhanced IN concentrations
from industrial sources has produced contradictory results. In
some cases (e.g., Hobbs and Locatelli, 1970; Al-Naime and
Saunders, 1985), above background IN concentrations have been
found in urban plumes while in other instances below background
levels have been found (e.g., Braham and Spyers-Duran, 1974;
Perez et al., 1985). Some of the discrepancies may be attributable
to differing measurement techniques (Szyrmer and Zawadzki,
1997). However, it is possible that a good deal of it is due to
differing degrees of deactivation of IN by pollutants such as
sulphate, which readily forms in the atmosphere and can coat IN
surfaces thereby deactivating them (particularly if the mechanism
for ice formation involves deposition from the gas phase). Indeed,
Bigg (1990) has presented evidence, albeit inconclusive, of a long-
term decrease in IN associated with increasing pollution, perhaps
acting through such a mechanism. There is also the possibility that
secondary aerosol constituents such as aliphatic alcohols or
dicarboxylic acids could coat inactive particles and thus transform
them into efficient IN. If so, an incubation period after primary
emission would be necessary and measurements could differ
depending on time from emission. Although variability in natural
heterogeneous IN sources may produce frequent circumstances
where natural IN sources exceed anthropogenic IN in importance,
it is difficult to see how the anthropogenic impact, both positive
and negative, can be neglected.

main growth and removal process. Models which represent
number concentration have been developed for mineral dust

far more difficult for sulphate and secondary organics because the
size distributions of condensing species depend on the size distri-

Chemistry Transport Models) are now available which directly
use information on cloud formation and removal from the GCMs

heterogeneous chemistry and wet removal (e.g. Feichter et al.,

The ability of the models to predict the vertical distributions of
aerosols was examined by comparing model predictions of the
vertical distribution of SO,?-, SO, and related parameters such as
ozone, hydrogen peroxide and cloud liquid-water content to mean
profiles taken during aircraft campaigns at North Bay, a remote
forested location (in southern Nova Scotia) 500 km north of the

within a factor of 2 of the observed mean profiles (which were
averages of 64 and 46 profiles for North Bay and Novia Scotia,
respectively) but there was a tendency for the models to be higher
than observations. The sulphur dioxide concentration was
generally within a factor of two of the observations. Those models
that overpredicted SO,?- also underpredicted SO, demonstrating
that the model treatment for the chemical transformation of SO, to
SO,2- is a source of uncertainty in the prediction of the vertical

One measure of our knowledge comes from the convergence in
predictions made by a variety of models. Difficulties in the analysis
and evaluation of such comparisons can result from models
employing different emissions, meteorological fields etc. A set of
standardised input was provided for the Comparison of Large
Scale Sulphate Aerosol Models (COSAM) workshop which took
place in 1998 and 1999 (see Barrie et al., 2001). Ten models partic-
ipated in this comparison. As noted above in Section 5.2.2.6, the
simulation of the processes determining the sulphate concentration
differed considerably between models. The fraction of sulphur
removed by precipitation ranged from 50 to 80% of the total source
of sulphur. The fraction of total chemical production of sulphate
from SO, that took place in clear air (in contrast to in-cloud) ranged
from 10 to 50%. This latter variability points to important
uncertainties in current model capability to predict the indirect
forcing by anthropogenic sulphate, because the mechanism of
sulphate production determines the number of CCN produced
(Section 5.3.3).

Because the processes for treating aerosol removal associated
with precipitation and deposition and in-cloud conversion of SO,
to sulphate are represented in climate models as sub-grid scale
processes, there are significant variations in the efficiency of these
processes between different models (see Section 5.2.2.6). In the
past, model intercomparisons sponsored by the World Climate
Research Programme (WCRP) have focussed on ???Rn, 7!°Pb,
SO,, and SO,"" (Jacob et al., 1997; Rasch et al., 2000b; Barrie et

relative performance of a major fraction of available large-scale
sulphur models. They have shown that most of the models are able
to simulate monthly average concentrations of species near the
surface over continental sites to within a factor of two. Models are
less sensitive to changes in removal rates near source regions, and
they tend to agree more closely with observations over source
regions than over remote regions. Comparison of models with
observations at remote receptor sites can indicate whether transport
and wet removal is well simulated but, for sulphate, may also be an
indication of whether local source strengths are correctly
estimated. The WCRP-sponsored model intercomparison in 1995
showed that model simulations differed significantly in the upper

For dust the model-observation comparison showed a better
agreement with surface observations in the Northern than in the
Southern Hemisphere. For example, the average absolute error
in the Northern Pacific was 179%, while it was 268% in the
Southern Pacific. In the Southern Hemisphere, almost all models
predict concentrations higher than the observations at all stations
poleward of 22°S. Thus, it appears that dust mobilisation
estimates may be too high, particularly those for Australia and
South America. The paucity of dust from these regions relative
to other arid dust source areas has been noted previously
(Prospero er al., 1989; Tegen and Fung, 1994; Rea, 1994), and
may reflect the relative tectonic stability, low weathering rates,
duration of land-surface exposure, and low human impacts in

The interpretation of the comparison of observed and
model-predicted concentrations for both organic carbon and
black carbon is more difficult because of both inaccuracies in the
observations (Section 5.1.2) and the fact that most measured
concentrations are only available on a campaign basis. In
addition, the source strength and atmospheric removal processes
of carbonaceous aerosols are poorly known. Most models were
able to reproduce the observed concentrations of BC to within a
factor of 10 (see Figure 5.10) and some models were consis-
tently better than this. Both modelled and observed concentra-
tions varied by a factor of about 1,000 between different sites, so
agreement to within a factor of 10 demonstrates predictive
capability. However, there are still large uncertainties remaining

Comparisons of models with observations for sulphate aerosols
and other sulphur compounds are particularly relevant for
assessing model capabilities because the emissions of sulphur
bearing compounds are better known than the emissions of other
aerosol compounds (Section 5.2). Thus, comparison can focus on
the capabilities of the models to treat transport and oxidation
processes. Recent field studies, however, have pointed out the
importance of organic aerosol compounds (Hegg et al., 1997),
dust aerosols (Li-Jones and Prospero, 1998; Prospero, 1999), and
sea salt aerosols (Murphy ef al., 1998a). Also, soot is important
because it decreases the reflection and increases the absorption of
solar radiation (Haywood and Shine, 1995). Furthermore, the
magnitude of the indirect effect is sensitive to the abundance of
natural aerosols (Penner et al. 1996; O’Dowd ef al., 1999;

The range for sea salt with D<2 lm increases to 6 if the GSFC
Gocart model is considered (with its higher sea salt flux). These
differences were also evident in comparing concentrations in the
upper troposphere. For example, in the upper troposphere (8 to
12 km) between 30 and 60°N, the range of predicted concentra-
tions of sulphate, organic carbon and black carbon was about a
factor of 5 to 10. This range increased to as much as a factor of
20 or more in the case of sea salt and dust.

"Based on this model comparison study, the ability of the global
models to reproduce the aerosol mixing ratios at the surface can be
described as acceptable for sulphate. However, improvement is
needed for the other aerosol species. The large differences in
predicted atmospheric aerosol burden which is the relevant
parameter in determining the forcing, impede an accurate estimate of
the aerosol climate effect. Improvement of the assessment of aerosol
burden requires more measurements within the free troposphere.

the one-wavelenth technique of Stowe et al. (1997). However, it

Modelled optical depths north of 30°N are sometimes higher
and sometimes lower than those of the retrieved AVHRR optical
depths. For example, there is an average difference of 0.13 in July
for the ULAQ model in comparison with result 2 for Nakajima et
al. (1999) while the average difference is —0.09 in January for the
ECHAM/GRANTOUR model in comparison with the retrieved
optical depths from Mishchenko er al. (1999). The modelled
optical depths in the latitude band from 30°N and 40°N are
systematically too high in July. For example, the average of the
modelled optical depths is larger than the satellite-derived optical
depth of Nakajima, Mishchenko, and Stowe on average by 0.06,
0.05 and 0.04, respectively. We note that sulphate and dust
provide the largest components of optical depth in this region
with sea salt providing the third most important component.
Since the sources represent the year 2000, while the measured
optical depths refer to an average of the years 1985 to 1988, some
of the overprediction of optical depth may be associated with
higher sources than the time period of the measurements. The

The modelled aerosol optical depths from 10°S to 30°S are
due to a combination of different aerosol types. They are system-
atically lower than the average of the retrieved optical depths by an
average of 0.06 with biases ranging from —0.14 to 0.01 in January,
from —0.12 to —0.02 in April, from —0.13 to 0.07 in July and from
—0.11 to 0.06 in October. As shown by the sensitivity study, much
of the difference between the modelled and retrieved zonal average
optical depths could be removed by using higher sea salt and DMS
fluxes. However, the spatial character of the differences reveals that
the cause of the discrepancies probably cannot be attributed to any
single source. For example, Figure 5.12 shows the difference
between the base case and sensitivity case for the
ECHAM/GRANTOUR model and the optical depths retrieved by
Mishchenko et al. (1999). In January the differences are largest in
the central Pacific Ocean. In April the differences appear largest in
the Pacific Ocean and in the Indian Ocean west of Australia. In July
and October the differences are mainly to the west and east of the
African continent and also in the mid-Pacific Ocean and west of
South America in October. We note that the large overprediction of
optical depth in both the base case and the sensitivity case off the
coast of Asia in July may be due to the difference in simulated year
and the year of the optical depth retrievals. The model simulations
used anthropogenic sulphate emissions appropriate to 2000 while
the retrievals refer to an average of 1985 to 1988 data.

"Workshop participants were asked to report their derived
optical depths. However, these varied widely and were often
much smaller than that derived here. Therefore, we constructed
the optical depths shown in Figure 5.11 from the frequency distri-
bution of relative humidity from the T21 version of the ECHAM
3.6 general circulation model, together with the reported monthly
average distributions of aerosol mixing ratios. The model optical
depths were derived using extinction coefficients at 0.55 um for
dry sea salt of 3.45 m?g""!, 0.69 m?g""!, and 0.20 m’g""! for
diameters in the size range from 0.2 to 2 um, 2.0 to 8 um and 8 to
20 um, respectively, and an extinction coefficient of 9.94 mg!
for sulphate. The humidity dependence of the extinction for sea
salt and dust was determined using the model described in Penner
et al. (1999a). The dust extinction coefficients were from Tegen et
al. (1997) and organic and black carbon extinction coefficients for
80% relative humidity were from Haywood et al. (1999). We also
examined the sensitivity of the modelled optical depths to a factor
of two increase in the DMS flux and to the use of monthly average
sea salt fluxes derived using the SSM/I wind fields. The OC and
BC extinction coefficients were also varied, adding the humidity
dependence determined by Penner et al. (1998b). Finally, the
extinction coefficient for sulphate was altered to that calculated
for an assumed ratio of total NH; and HNO; to H,SO, of four. The
line in the graph labelled “summed sensitivity study” shows the
results for the ECHAM/GRANTOUR model when these para-
meters were varied. Most of the difference between the summed
sensitivity case and that for the baseline ECHAM/GRANTOUR

model is due to the use of larger DMS and sea salt fluxes.

models, the reflected radiation in mid-ocean regions was under-
predicted relative to ERBE, but the area of underprediction was
not as large as the area of underprediction for the GFDL model
with the low sea salt option. For these models, the predicted
reflected radiation for the region north of 30°N was sometimes
higher than that from the ERBE satellite, but this was not consis-
tent across all models. In general, this analysis showed that the
comparison of model results with the reflected radiation from
ERBE is broadly consistent with that developed above for the

The resulting overall uncertainty in the forcing by
aerosols associated with fossil fuels and other industrial
emissions is + 0.42 Wm”; that is, if the global mean forcing is
evaluated as —0.6 Wm (the row value calculated by using the
central values in the forcing equation), then the range of
estimated global mean forcing is —0.1 to -1.0 Wm. This range
encompasses values for recent evaluations of the forcing for the
individual components comprising the industrial aerosols (see
Chapter 6). The main uncertainties are those for the upscatter
fraction, the burden (which includes the propagated uncertainties
in emissions), and the mass scattering efficiency, in that order. If
the mode of mixing of black carbon were assumed to be external,
instead of internal as used here, then the uncertainty range would
be similar, but the central value for fossil fuel aerosols might be
instead of -0.6 Wm”.

"In summary, analysis of the AVHRR comparisons indicates
that significant uncertainties remain in both our ability to retrieve
aerosol optical thickness from satellites and in our ability to
model aerosol effects on the radiation budget. For example, there
is a global average difference between the optical depth retrieved
by Mishchenko ef al. (1999) and that retrieved by Stowe et al.
(1997) of 0.05 and a difference between Nakajima et al. (1999)
and Stowe et al. (1997) of 0.03. The global average difference
between the average optical depth from the models and the
average optical depth from the satellite retrieval is of the same
magnitude, namely —0.04. In the region 10°S to 30°S, the
analysis indicates that modelled optical depths are consistently
too low. Such a model underestimate might indicate that the
retrieved optical depth from satellites is too high, for example,
because the cloud screening algorithm is not adequate in this
region. Alternatively, there may be a need for a larger source of
aerosols in this region or for smaller modelled removal rates.

There are, of course, several sources of uncertainty that can
not be evaluated using this approach. For example, uncertainties
associated with the vertical distribution of the aerosol and with
potential correlations between clouds and aerosol abundances are
not evaluated. Furthermore, uncertainties associated with the
radiative transfer treatment (which might be of order 20%
(Boucher et al., 1998)) are neglected. A further caveat is that the
uncertainty estimates of Table 5.9 depend on the assumption that
the data chosen for the size distribution are representative
throughout those areas where these aerosol types contribute to
forcing. Because we used observations from continental polluted
regions for fossil fuel aerosols and from regional measurements
for biomass aerosols, they may not encompass the full set of size
distributions that may occur in regions outside of those where
these measurements are valid.

"‘The estimates of indirect forcing that include feedback to the
liquid-water path and cloud amount from changes in cloud
microphysics and precipitation efficiency range from —1.1 Wm
to -4.8 Wm~ (Table 5.11b). Due to the nature of the calcula-
tion, these are not strict estimates of radiative forcing, but as
noted above, Rotstayn and Penner (2001) have shown that the
eedback effects are probably not significant so that these may
be viewed as estimates of forcing. The largest absolute value,
that obtained by Lohmann and Feichter (1997) using the Xu and
Randall and the Beheng parametrization schemes, is considered
less realistic because the comparison of the short- and long-
wave cloud radiative fluxes with those from the Earth Radiation
Budget Experiment (ERBE) was relatively poor. The next
highest value (-3.2 Wm from Ghan er al., 2001b) was
obtained with a model using a very simple cloud cover para-
metrization (full coverage if saturated and no coverage if
unsaturated). Thus, based on the present modelling, a more
ikely range for the combination of the first and second indirect
effects is —1.1 to -2.2 Wm. However, this range only includes
one model estimate for the effects of aerosols from biomass
burning as well as industrial aerosols (i.e. —1.1 to —1.9 from
Lohmann et al., 2000) and the assessment of carbon aerosol
orcing from this model (-0.9 Wm”) is less than that for carbon
aerosols from the first indirect effect from the Chuang et al.
(2000a) model in Table 5.1 1a (i.e. -1.51 Wm”). In view of this,
the range of forcing estimates for the combination of first and
second indirect effects is —1.1 to -3.7 Wm”. Clearly, the

 
"	Text
"ments of this parameter are for low (dry) RH. Second, it was
assumed that the specific aerosol absorption did not change with
humidification while that of light scattering followed f(RH).
While reasonable at this time, this issue needs further investiga-
tion. Another assumption implicit in the formula for planetary
albedo change is that both absorption and scattering by aerosols
are not significant compared to cloud effects when clouds are
present. As Haywood and Ramaswamy (1998) have pointed out,
this assumption is reasonable for scattering aerosols but not for
strongly absorbing aerosols. The overall effect of including the
effects of absorbing aerosols in the presence of clouds would be
to reduce the net forcing relative to that calculated here. Turning
to other issues, only second order terms were used in the Taylor
expansion. While certainly valid for cases in which the uncertain-
ties in the independent parameters do not exceed 20% of the
central values, this neglect becomes somewhat problematic for
larger uncertainties. Since there are several variables whose
uncertainties are of the order of 50%, an assessment was made of
possible underestimation of error by full functional evaluation,
ie., a population of values for the forcing function was generated
from the population of the most uncertain variables (all other
variables held constant) and the variance in the forcing function
generated in this way compared with that derived from Taylor
expansion. It was found that the error in variance propagation
was second order (<10%) and has therefore been neglected here.
Finally, there is an implicit assumption that all of the variables are
normally distributed.

by Ghan et al. (2001b). They found an increase in the indirect

"effect alone. Lohmann and Feichter (1997) examined the effect
of two different cloud cover parametrizations (Sundquist et al.,
1989 and Xu and Randall, 1996) on the combined first and
second indirect effects, which gave a difference of more than a
factor of 3 in the indirect forcing. Indeed, the effect of
uncertainties in the GCM predictions of cloud cover (which are
known to be inaccurate) is not known.

The autoconversion parametrization is a critical step in the
simulation of the second indirect effect. Lohmann and Feichter
(1997) compared two such parametrizations and found a differ-
ence in the total indirect forcing of a factor of two. Ghan et al.
(2001b) compared two other methods for autoconversion and
found a difference of about 30%. Rotstayn (1999) performed a
sensitivity experiment in which the droplet size threshold for
autoconversion was increased. This resulted in a reduction of
the second indirect effect, but there was a slightly compensating
increase in the first indirect effect. This is an area of high
sensitivity and uncertainty.

"Validation of the simulations from global models is an essential
component of estimating and reducing the uncertainties in the
indirect forcing. Comparisons of observations and modelled
concentrations of chemical species have been discussed in
Section 5.4.1.3 while comparisons of modelled and satellite-
derived aerosol optical depths were discussed in Section 5.4.1.4.
Here, comparisons with observations of several other model
products important for indirect forcing are examined.
Unfortunately, there is only a very small set of observations of the
physical, chemical, and radiative properties of clouds from in situ
methods available. Thus, validations with these types of datasets
are left to limited temporal and spatial scales and to comparing
relationships among various quantities. Lohmann et al. (2001),
for example, compared prognostic simulations with observations
of the relationships between particulate sulphate and total particle
mass, between particle number concentration and sulphate mass,
and between Ng and sulphate mass. The relationships between
sulphate mass and total particle number concentrations was
larger than observations in the case of internal mixtures but was
smaller than observations in the case of external mixtures. Ghan
et al. (2001a) found that the results of their determination of Ny
using their mechanistic parametrization were comparable to the
results using the empirical parametrization of Boucher and
Lohmann (1995). Such tests are important for large-scale model
parametrizations because comparisons of absolute concentrations

on the scale of the model grid si size are difficult.

"A few of the factors that may contribute to this uncertainty are:

¢ The pre-industrial sulphate used in these studies varies by a
factor of just over two, and the anthropogenic indirect forcing
is calculated from the difference between the pre-industrial and
industrial scenarios. Considering the non-linearities in the
parametrizations of Ng, the pre-industrial sulphate concentra-
tion can be a significant factor.

¢ The variance in the industrial sulphate concentrations is about
50%.

¢ The parametrizations or methods of relating droplet number
concentrations to aerosol concentrations have been discussed
in Section 5.3.4. Using Figure 5.7, we can estimate the range
of uncertainty attached to simply the differences in the
parametrizations shown in the figure. For stratiform cloud,
assuming a mean sulphate concentration of 0.5 tg m™ over the
oceans and 2.0 ug m™ over the land, the differences among the
parametrizations in Figure 5.7 amount to about 30%.
Neglecting that there is a serious question about the ability of
the empirical methods to represent the global aerosol, this is a
reasonable approximation based on current knowledge. As a
couple of footnotes, Rotstayn (1999) compared the forcings
using the Boucher and Lohmann (1995) parametrization with
a similar parametrization from Roelofs er al. (1998), and found
the result with the Roelofs et al. method was 25% higher. And
the relatively close agreement of the Boucher and Lohmann
(1995) method with the prognostic method (Figure 5.7) has
also been seen in the simulated results from MIRAGE model
(Ghan et al., 2001a).

* Changes in the vertical distribution of the aerosol will affect the
indirect forcing because of changes in its spatial relationship to
cloud. Rotstayn (1999) found a 24% change in the radiative
forcing depending on whether the aerosol concentration
decreased exponentially or was uniform with height through the
lower 10 km. Jones and Slingo (1996) distributed the aerosol
mass uniformly, half in the lower 2 km, and half above,
compared with Jones et al. (1994b) who confined half the aerosol
mass to the lower 1.5 km. Jones and Slingo (1996) obtained an
indirect forcing 15% higher than Jones et al. (1994b).

height from cloud base to cloud top. Such a profile is more similar
to observed profiles and might be expected to produce a better
comparison with the observations. While the Jones and Slingo

contrasts, their results indicate a land-ocean contrast in the opposite

note that many factors may affect the results of this type of compar-

the r. calculations to uncertainties in the sulphate concentration

of a few micrometres. Moreover, the satellite determination of reg

In order to assess the overall uncertainty in forcing, the
covariance between the base parameters Ny, LWC and h must be
evaluated. But both LWC and h are assumed to be constant in the
first indirect effect, and therefore the covariance is assumed to be
zero. Certainly, the limited observations available (cf., Hegg et
al., 1996b) do not show any covariance. Nevertheless, it is
important to note this potential effect and the possible impact of
the second indirect effect (precipitation modulation effects by
aerosols) on the uncertainty in the first.

Another covariance which cannot be neglected arises in the
evaluation of the uncertainty in AA, from the possible covariance
between A, and A,’. This covariance arises because of the
dependence of the perturbation in cloud albedo on both the
unperturbed aerosol concentration and the unperturbed albedo.
We assessed this covariance by using equations (4) and (3) to
generate a set of corresponding values of the perturbed and
unperturbed albedos for different values of Ny. Then a linear fit
to the parameters AN, and A,’ was used to derive the correlation
coefficient and then the covariance. Various sample sizes and
incremental values of the aerosol perturbation were generated to
test the stability of the correlation. This procedure resulted in a

We then use Taylor expansions of the various equations given

the central values of the parameters used in the calculations. Thus
the uncertainty involves the uncertainties in the concentration of
SO, and in the empirical coefficients used to relate the concen-

necessarily involves an evaluation of A, for both the background

together with corresponding values for LWC and h, which are
based on available observations, are then used to generate
uncertainties in the cloud optical depth. This hierarchical evalua-

Several issues arise that deserve some discussion. The first
such issue is the concatenation of uncertainties in the empirical
relationship between the concentration of SO,2- and Ng. The
uncertainty in SO,?- is straightforward and is based on the assess-
ment of uncertainty in burden and the uncertainty in emissions as
used in Section 5.4.2. The uncertainty in the relationship between
SO,?> and Ng equation (3), requires an evaluation of the
uncertainties in the coefficients A and B. Based on a comparison
of the parametrization of Boucher and Lohmann (1995) with that
of Jones et al. (1994b) (Figure 5.7), we assign an ad hoc contri-
bution of the functional relationship to the uncertainty in Ng of
40% of the central value. We then further assume that the
uncertainties in A and B contribute equally to the total uncertainty
(i.e., 40%) and, with these constraints, derived the uncertainties in
A and B. This allows us to use Taylor expansions for both the

Because the scenarios do not provide a breakdown of emissions
for CO by source category, this scaling implicitly assumes that as
a given region develops, the ratio of emissions of CO by biomass
burning and by fossil fuel burning remains roughly constant. We

The emissions for 2030 and 2100 from the draft “A2 and BI
scenarios that were considered in the IPCC workshop are shown
in Table 5.7 (see the Appendix to this volume for the final SRES
emissions). As noted there, SO, emissions in 2030 are about a
factor of 1.6 higher than those in 2000 in the draft A2 scenario,
but decrease thereafter to global average levels that are less than
the present-day estimates in 2100. Carbon aerosol emissions
grow by a factor of 1.3 in 2030 in the A2 scenario and continue
to grow to 2100 by an additional factor of 1.8. In the B1 scenario,
both SO, and carbon aerosol emissions are controlled by 2100,
falling by 60 and 3%, respectively, compared to 2000. For
comparison, the table also shows emissions for the IS92a
scenario, with carbon aerosol emissions constructed as above for
the SRES scenarios. In the IS92a scenario, growth continues
throughout the time period for both SO, and carbon emissions:
SO, and CO emissions are a factor of 1.8 and 1.6 larger in 2100,

"The above assumptions, together with the parameter values
given in Table 5.13, yield a central value for the indirect forcing
over marine areas of —1.4 Wm’? together with an uncertainty of
+1.4 Wm~. Hence, the forcing lies in the range between zero and
—2.8 Wm”. This range is in reasonable agreement with that given
in Chapter 6, based on GCM assessments. Nearly all of the
uncertainty in the forcing is associated with that in the planetary
albedo which, in turn, is dominated by the uncertainties in the
perturbed and unperturbed cloud albedos, and thus in the cloud
optical depths. However, it is interesting to note that most of the
uncertainty in the optical depths for both perturbed and
unperturbed clouds arises from the uncertainties in the cloud
LWC and cloud thickness, and not from the uncertainties in the
CDNC. This is not actually particularly surprising and is simply
due to the stronger functional dependence of the optical depth on
the LWC and thickness, h. This allocation of uncertainty may be
slightly misleading because the 1st indirect effect depends on an
assumption of fixed h and LWC. Yet here we are concerned with
evaluating both the central estimate as well as its uncertainty.
Hence, knowledge of h and LWC are needed. Indeed, considera-
tion of these parameters and the accuracy of their representation
in GCMs must certainly contribute to any uncertainty in the
estimates of forcing from GCMs. Thus, it seems clear that
progress in reducing the uncertainty in the indirect forcing of the
first kind will be at least as dependent on acquiring better data on
cloud LWC and thickness as on better quantifying anthropogenic
aerosol concentrations and their effects on Ny. At a somewhat
lower priority, it is clearly quite important to better understand
the relationship between cloud drop number concentration and
sulphate concentration. The total uncertainty is clearly dependent
on this relationship. If it were significantly different in form, a
somewhat different order of contribution to total uncertainty
might have arisen. On the other hand, the uncertainty in the
magnitude of the emissions of sulphur gases as well as the
uncertainty in the burden of sulphate played only a minor role in
the determination of the overall uncertainty.

land cover on spatially disagreggated emissions are not well
developed. Thus, even though changes in land use would be
expected to affect vegetation cover and this is responsible for
emissions of terpenes and determines which areas are subject to
dust uplift, these effects could not be included. Furthermore, the
understanding of how phytoplankton populations that produce
DMS may change with changes in climate is poor. Therefore, in
the following, only the effects of changes in temperature, precip-
itation, light levels, and wind speeds on future emissions were
considered. The changes in wind speed were estimated from the
ratio of monthly average wind speeds for the years 2090 to 2100
to that for the years 1990 to 2000 associated with the IS92a
scenario (Dai et al., 2001). This ratio was used to adjust the wind
speeds that were used to generate current (2000) emissions to
obtain future (2100) emissions of both DMS and dust. This
method gives only a first-order estimate of possible changes,
since it assumes that the distribution of wind speeds within a
month remains constant with time. For wind speeds associated
with sea salt, a somewhat different method was used (see below).
The terpene fluxes were estimated directly from the daily data
that were projected by the CSM simulation for 2100.

Overall, predicted dust emissions increase by approximately
10%. There are substantial increases in some seasons and
locations (e.g. increases in Australia (85%) in winter and in
Europe (86%) and East Asia (42%) in summer). Because dust
may be especially important as an ice-nucleating agent in clouds,
these possible changes add substantial uncertainty to the
projected future indirect forcing.

study was performed. In this study, the A2 2100 emission
scenario was used to simulate HNO; concentrations in 2100
using the Harvard University model (see Chapter 4) and the
present day anthropogenic NH; emissions were scaled by the
increase in N,O emissions in 2100 from the draft SRES A2
scenario. Then the model described by Adams et al. (1999) was
used to estimate direct forcing after condensation of the
additional HNO; and NH; onto the calculated sulphate aerosol.

The production of sea salt aerosol is also a strong function of wind

speed. The semi-empirical formulation of Monahan et al. (1986)
was used to produce global monthly sea salt fluxes for eight size
intervals (dry diameter of 0.06 to 16 um) using procedures
discussed in Gong et al. (1997a,b). In order to project sea salt
emissions for the workshop, the ratio of daily average wind speed
in the ten years prior to 2100 and 2000 was used to scale the 2000
daily average sea salt flux to the one in 2100. Because this method
may overestimate emissions if the product of the daily average
ratio with the daily average winds in 2000 produces high wind
speeds with a high frequency, the calculation was checked using
the ratio of the monthly average wind speeds. This produced a
total sea salt flux that was 13% smaller than the projections given
in the workshop specifications.

One issue of importance for future scenarios concerns the
treatment of black carbon removal rates. Whereas most models
projected changes for BC to be approximately linear, the ULAQ
and GISS models had somewhat different treatments. In the
ULAQ model, the reaction of O3; with BC leads to additional
losses for BC. This caused a change of —30% for BC in the A2
2100 scenario in the simulation that included consideration of
chemistry feedbacks (SC6) relative to the scenario without
changes in chemistry (SC3). The GISS model, on the other hand,
did not consider any heterogeneous loss, but did assume that the
loss of BC associated with wet scavenging depended on the
interaction of BC with SO,*-. In this model, as SO, emissions
decrease, the lifetime of BC increased. This model projects a
50% increase in BC lifetime (and thus in the concentrations
relative to emissions) in 2100 associated with the A2 scenario.
Thus, the uncertainty associated with the projection of BC

concentrations is larger than that for the other aerosol types.

"In order to project future aerosol concentrations, we formed the
average burdens from the models that gave reasonable agreement
with observations for the 2000 scenario. As noted above, the
differences in the burdens calculated by the different models
point to substantial uncertainties in the prediction of current
burdens and these translate into similar uncertainties in projecting
future burdens. Except for sulphate and black carbon, however,
the future projected global average burdens scaled approximately
linearly with emissions. Thus, we may assume that the projected
uncertainty in future burdens is mainly determined by the
uncertainty in the emissions themselves together with the
uncertainty in the burdens associated with different model
treatments. For SO,?-, future anthropogenic concentrations were
not linear in the emissions. For example, some models projected
increases in burden relative to emissions while others projected
decreases. The range of projected changes in anthropogenic
burden relative to emissions was —14% to +25% depending on
the scenario. Use of the average of the models for the projection
of anthropogenic SO,2- and total SO,?- may therefore bias the
results somewhat, but the uncertainties in the projected SO,2-
concentrations are smaller than those introduced from the range
of estimates for the 2000 scenario itself. Table 5.14 gives our
projected average burdens for each draft SRES scenario. Results
for the burdens associated with the final SRES scenarios are
reproduced in Appendix II and are shown in Figure 5.13 (see

"Predicted sea salt emissions were 3,340 Tg in 2000 and
increased to 5,880 Tg in 2100. These increases point to a
potentially important negative climate feedback. For example, the
present day direct radiative impact of sea salt is estimated to be
between —0.75 and —2.5 Wm using the clear-sky estimates from
Haywood er al. (1999) or —0.34 Wm using the whole-sky
estimates from Jacobson (2001). Assuming the ratio of whole-sky
to clear-sky forcing from Jacobson (2000b), we project that these
changes in sea salt emissions might lead to a radiative feedback in
2100 of up to -0.8 Wm. If we assume that the near-doubling of
the sea salt mass flux would result in a proportional increase in the
number flux, a significant increase in reflected radiation may also
result from the indirect effect. The LLNL/Umich model was used
to evaluate the possible impact of these emissions. It was found
that the changes in natural emissions in 2100 result in a radiative
feedback of —1.16 Wm’? in the 2100 A2 scenario. These projected
climate changes rely on the projected wind speed changes from
the NCAR CSM model. Because projections from other models
may not be as large, we also calculated the projected sea salt
emissions from three other climate models using the ratio of
monthly average winds for the time period from 2090 to 2100 to
that for the time period 1990 to 2000 to scale the 2000 sea salt
fluxes. Compared to the projections from the NCAR CSM, these
models resulted in annual average fluxes that were 37% higher
(GFDL model), 13% smaller (Max Planck model), and 9%
smaller (Hadley Centre UK Met Office model). The monthly
average temperature change associated with these wind speed and
sea salt projections was 2.8°K (GFDL model; Knutson er al.
1999), 2.8°K (Max Planck model; Roeckner et al. 1999) and
2.15°K (Hadley Centre UK Met Office model; Gordon et al.,

NCAR CSM model (Dai et al., 2001).

Concerns about aerosols derive from a number of other
considerations. These include visibility, toxic effects and human
health, interactions of aerosols with chemical processes in the
troposphere and stratosphere, acid deposition, and air pollution.
Of these concerns, those associated with toxic effects and
visibility have led the industrialised countries to promulgate
standards to reduce the concentrations of aerosols in urban and
also more pristine locations. Also, concerns about the effects of
acid rain have led to increased controls over the emissions of
SO,. As shown above, the SRES scenarios for the future
(Nakiéenovié et al., 2000) have all assumed that emissions of SO,
will eventually decrease, and the AlT and B2 scenarios predict
that sulphur emissions start to decrease on a global average basis
almost immediately.

"Atmospheric measurements have lagged behind awareness of the
importance of aerosols in climate. There is a great challenge in
adequately characterising the nature and occurrence of
atmospheric aerosols and in including their effects in models to
reduce uncertainties in climate prediction. Because aerosols: (i)
originate from a variety of sources, (ii) are distributed across a
wide spectrum of particle sizes and (iii) have atmospheric
lifetimes that are much shorter than those of most greenhouse
gases, their concentrations and composition have great spatial
and temporal variability. Satellite-based measurements of
aerosols are a necessary but not sufficient component of an
approach needed to acquire an adequate information base upon
which progress in understanding the role of aerosols in climate
can be built. Below we outline measurements and process level
studies that are necessary to reduce uncertainties in both direct
and indirect forcing. These studies and observations are needed
both to improve the models on which climate forcing rely and to
check our understanding of this forcing as aerosol concentrations
change in the future.

"As we have seen, anthropogenic aerosols may have a substantial
effect on the present day aerosol abundance, optical depth and
thus forcing of climate. While we have made substantial progress
in defining the role of anthropogenic aerosols on direct forcing,
significant uncertainties remain, particularly with the role of
anthropogenic organic and black carbon aerosols in detemining
this forcing. Our ability to assess the indirect forcing by aerosols
has a much larger uncertainty associated with it. The largest
estimates of negative forcing due to the warm-cloud indirect
effect may approach or exceed the positive forcing due to long-
lived greenhouse gases. On the other hand, there is sufficient
uncertainty in the calculation of indirect forcing to allow values
that are substantially smaller than the positive forcing by
greenhouse gases. Other factors which have not been assessed
include possible anthropogenic perturbations to high level
cirrus clouds as well as to clouds in the reservoir between 0°C
and —35°C. As we have discussed, significant positive forcing is
possible from aerosol-induced increased formation of cirrus
and/or from increased glaciation of clouds in the region
between 0°C and —35°C.

There is a paucity of systematic vertical profile measurements of

chemical and optical properties. For these parameters, no
climatological database exists that can be used to evaluate the

would be best co-located with the ground-based network stations.
Since they involve routine aircraft surveillance missions and are

* Models have been used to estimate the direct radiative forcing for
five distinct aerosol species of anthropogenic origin. The global,
annual mean radiative forcing is estimated as -0.4 Wm (-0.2
to -0.8 Wm”) for sulphate aerosols; —0.2 Wm (-0.07 to -0.6
Wm”) for biomass burning aerosols; —0.10 Wm (-0.03 to
-0.30 Wm”) for fossil fuel organic carbon aerosols; +0.2 Wm
(40.1 to +0.4 Wm) for fossil fuel black carbon aerosols; and
in the range —0.6 to +0.4 Wm for mineral dust aerosols. The
LOSU for sulphate aerosols is low while for biomass burning,
fossil fuel organic carbon, fossil fuel black carbon, and mineral
dust aerosols the LOSU is very low.

* Models have been used to estimate the “first” indirect effect of
anthropogenic sulphate and carbonaceous aerosols (namely, a
reduction in the cloud droplet size at constant liquid water
content) as applicable in the context of liquid clouds, yielding
global mean radiative forcings ranging from —0.3 to -1.8 Wm.
Because of the large uncertainties in aerosol and cloud
processes and their parametrizations in general circulation
models (GCMs), the potentially incomplete knowledge of the
radiative effect of black carbon in clouds, and the possibility
that the forcings for individual aerosol types may not be
additive, a range of radiative forcing from 0 to -2 Wm is
adopted considering all aerosol types, with no best estimate.
The LOSU for this forcing is very low.

¢ The “second” indirect effect of aerosols (a decrease in the
precipitation efficiency, increase in cloud water content and
cloud lifetime) is another potentially important mechanism for
climate change. It is difficult to define and quantify in the
context of current radiative forcing of climate change evalua-
tions and current model simulations. No estimate is therefore
given. Nevertheless, present GCM calculations suggest that the
radiative flux perturbation associated with the second aerosol
indirect effect is of the same sign and could be of similar
magnitude compared to the first effect.

"° Kadiative forcing Continues to be a userul tool to esumate, to a
first order, the relative climate impacts (viz., relative global
mean surface temperature responses) due to radiatively induced
perturbations. The practical appeal of the radiative forcing
concept is due, in the main, to the assumption that there exists
a general relationship between the global mean forcing and the
global mean equilibrium surface temperature response (i.e., the
global mean climate sensitivity parameter, 4) which is similar
for all the different types of forcings. Model investigations of
responses to many of the relevant forcings indicate an approx-
imate near invariance of A (to about 25%). There is some
evidence from model studies, however, that 4 can be substan-
tially different for certain forcing types. Reiterating the IPCC
WGI Second Assessment Report (IPCC, 1996a) (hereafter
SAR), the global mean forcing estimates are not necessarily
indicators of the detailed aspects of the potential climate
responses (e.g., regional climate change).

¢ The simple formulae used by the IPCC to calculate the
radiative forcing due to well-mixed greenhouse gases have
been improved, leading to a slight change in the forcing
estimates. Compared to the use of the earlier expressions, the
improved formulae, for fixed changes in gas concentrations,
decrease the carbon dioxide (CO) and nitrous oxide (N,O)
radiative forcing by 15%, increase the CFC-11 and CFC-12
radiative forcing by 10 to 15%, while yielding no change in the
case of methane (CH,). Using the new expressions, the
radiative forcing due to the increases in the well-mixed
greenhouse gases from the pre-industrial (1750) to present time
(1998) is now estimated to be +2.43 Wm (comprising CO,
(1.46 Wm), CHy (0.48 Wm), N30 (0.15 Wm) and halocar-
bons (halogen-containing compounds) (0.34 Wm)), with an
uncertainty! of 10% and a high level of scientific understanding
(LOSU).

¢ The forcing due to the loss of stratospheric ozone (O3)
between 1979 and 1997 is estimated to be —0.15 Wm?
(range: —0.05 to -0.25 Wm). The magnitude is slightly
larger than in the SAR owing to the longer period now consid-
ered. Incomplete knowledge of the O3 losses near the
tropopause continues to be the main source of uncertainty.
The LOSU of this forcing is assigned a medium rank.

¢ The global average radiative forcing due to increases in
tropospheric O3 since pre-industrial times is estimated to be
+0.35 + 0.15 Wm"". This estimate is consistent with the
SAR estimate, but is based on a much wider range of model
studies and a single analysis that is constrained by observa-
tions; there are uncertainties because of the inter-model

century is uncertain. The evolution of the direct aerosol
forcing due to sulphates parallels approximately the secular
changes in the sulphur emissions, but it is more difficult to
estimate the temporal evolution due to the other aerosol
components, while estimates for the indirect forcings are
even more problematic. The temporal evolution estimates
indicate that the net natural forcing (solar plus stratospheric
aerosols from volcanic eruptions) has been negative over the
past two and possibly even the past four decades. In

gases has increased rapidly over the past four decades.

many of which are ethers that may be considered as halocarbon
substitutes. Some of the GWPs have larger uncertainties than
others, particularly for those gases where detailed laboratory data
on lifetimes are not yet available. The direct GWPs have been
calculated relative to CO, using an improved calculation of the
CO, radiative forcing, the SAR response function for a CO,
pulse, and new estimates for the radiative forcing and lifetimes
for a number of gases. As a consequence of changes in the
radiative forcing for CO, and CFC-11, the revised GWPs are
typically 20% higher than listed in the SAR. Indirect GWPs are
also discussed for some new gases, including CO. The direct
GWPs for those species whose lifetimes are well characterised
are estimated to be accurate (relative to one another) to within
+35%, but the indirect GWPs are less certain.

different future scenarios (up to 2100) of the emissions of

et al., 2000; see also Chapters 3, 4 and 5). Although there is
a large variation in the estimates from the different
scenarios, the results indicate that the forcing (evaluated
relative to pre-industrial times, 1750) due to the trace gases
taken together is projected to increase, with the fraction of
the total due to CO, becoming even greater than for the
present day. The direct aerosol (sulphate, black and organic
carbon components taken together) radiative forcing
(evaluated relative to the present day, 2000) varies in sign
for the different scenarios. The direct aerosol effects are
estimated to be substantially smaller in magnitude than that
of CO. No estimates are made for the spatial aspects of the
future forcings. Relative to 2000, the change in the direct

smaller in magnitude than that of CO).

"* Radiative forcing due to changes in total solar irradiance (TSI)
is estimated to be +0.3 + 0.2 Wm for the period 1750 to the
present. The wide range given, and the very low LOSU, are
largely due to uncertainties in past values of TSI. Satellite
observations, which now extend for two decades, are of
sufficient precision to show variations in TSI over the solar 11-
year activity cycle of about 0.08%. Variations over longer
periods may have been larger but the techniques used to
reconstruct historical values of TSI from proxy observations
(e.g., sunspots) have not been adequately verified. Solar
radiation varies more substantially in the ultraviolet region and
GCM studies suggest that inclusion of spectrally resolved solar
irradiance variations and solar-induced stratospheric O3
changes may improve the realism of model simulations of the
impact of solar variability on climate. Other mechanisms for
the amplification of solar effects on climate, such as enhance-
ment of the Earth’s electric field causing electrofreezing of
cloud particles, may exist but do not yet have a rigorous
theoretical or observational basis.

mixed greenhouse gas forcing since pre-industrial times. Since
that Assessment, the number of agents identified as potential

nied by a high degree of confidence (SAR; Shine and Forster,
1999). But, in the case of short-lived species, notably aerosols,
observations of the concentrations over wide spatial regions and
over long time periods are needed. Such global observations are
not yet in place. Thus, estimates are drawn from model simula-

The prior IPCC Assessments as well as ‘other recent studies
(notably the SAR; see also Hansen et al. (1997a) and Shine and
Forster (1999)) have discussed the rationale for this definition
and its application to the issue of forcing of climate change. The
salient elements of the radiative forcing concept that characterise
its eventual applicability as a tool are summarised in Appendix
6.1 (see also WMO, 1986; SAR). Defined in the above manner,
radiative forcing of climate change is a modelling concept that
constitutes a simple but important means of estimating the
relative impacts due to different natural and anthropogenic
radiative causes upon the surface-troposphere system (see
Section 6.2.1). The IPCC Assessments have, in particular,
focused on the forcings between pre-industrial times (taken here
to be 1750) and the present (1990s, and approaching 2000).
Another period of interest in recent literature has been the 1980
to 2000 period, which corresponds to a time frame when a global
coverage of the climate system from satellites has become
possible.

"The term “radiative forcing” has been employed in the IPCC
Assessments to denote an externally imposed perturbation in the
radiative energy budget of the Earth’s climate system. Such a
perturbation can be brought about by secular changes in the
concentrations of radiatively active species (e.g., CO», aerosols),
changes in the solar irradiance incident upon the planet, or other
changes that affect the radiative energy absorbed by the surface
(e.g., changes in surface reflection properties). This imbalance in
the radiation budget has the potential to lead to changes in
climate parameters and thus result in a new equilibrium state of
the climate system. In particular, IPCC (1990, 1992, 1994) and
the Second Assessment Report (IPCC, 1996) (hereafter SAR)
used the following definition for the radiative forcing of the
climate system: “The radiative forcing of the surface-troposphere
system due to the perturbation in or the introduction of an agent
(say, a change in greenhouse gas concentrations) is the change in
net (down minus up) irradiance (solar plus long-wave; in Wm)
at the tropopause AFTER allowing for stratospheric temperatures
to readjust to radiative equilibrium, but with surface and tropo-
spheric temperatures and state held fixed at the unperturbed
values”. In the context of climate change, the term forcing is
restricted to changes in the radiation balance of the surface-
troposphere system imposed by external factors, with no changes
in stratospheric dynamics, without any surface and tropospheric
feedbacks in operation (i.e., no secondary effects induced
because of changes in tropospheric motions or its thermodynamic
state), and with no dynamically-induced changes in the amount
and distribution of atmospheric water (vapour, liquid, and solid
forms). Note that one potential forcing type, the second indirect
effect of aerosols (Chapter 5 and Section 6.8), comprises
microphysically-induced changes in the water substance. The
IPCC usage of the “global mean” forcing refers to the globally
and annually averaged estimate of the forcing.

While the total climate feedback for the spatially homo-
geneous and the considered inhomogeneous forcings does not
differ significantly, leading to a near-invariant climate sensitivity,
the individual feedback mechanisms (water vapour, ice albedo,
lapse rate, clouds) can have different strengths (Chen and
Ramaswamy, 1996a,b). The feedback effects can be of consider-
ably larger magnitude than the initial forcing and govern the
magnitude of the global mean response (Ramanathan, 1981;
Wetherald and Manabe, 1988; Hansen ef al., 1997a). For different
types of perturbations, the relative magnitudes of the feedbacks
can vary substantially.

For spatially homogeneous forcings of opposite signs, the
responses are somewhat similar in magnitude, although the ice
albedo feedback mechanism can yield an asymmetry in the high
latitude response with respect to the sign of the forcing (Chen and
Ramaswamy, 1996a). Even if the forcings are spatially homo-
geneous, there could be changes in land surface energy budgets
that depend on the manner of the perturbation (Chen and
Ramaswamy, 1996a). Furthermore, for the same global mean
forcing, dynamic feedbacks involving changes in convective
heating and precipitation can be initiated in the spatially inhomo-
geneous perturbation cases that differ from those in the spatially
homogeneous perturbation cases.

Overall, the three-dimensional AOGCM experiments

The nature of the response and the forcing-response relation

the forcing (see WMO, 1999). A case in point is O; changes, since
this initiates a vertically inhomogeneous forcing owing to differing
characteristics of the solar and long-wave components (WMO,
1992). Another type of forcing is that due to absorbing aerosols in
the troposphere (Kondratyev, 1999). In this instance, the surface
experiences a deficit while the atmosphere gains short-wave
radiative energy. Hansen ef al. (1997a) show that, for both these
special types of forcing, if the perturbation occurs close to the
surface, complex feedbacks involving lapse rate and cloudiness
could alter the climate sensitivity substantially from that prevailing
for a similar magnitude of perturbation imposed at other altitudes.

northern latitudes during the last glacial maximum). However,
different values of climate sensitivity can result from the different
GCMs which, in turn, are different from the A values obtained with
the radiative-convective models. Hansen et al. (1997a) show that
the variation in A for most of the globally distributed forcings
suspected of influencing climate over the past century is typically
within about 20%. Extending considerations to some of the
spatially confined forcings yields a range of about 25 to 30%
around a central estimate (see also Forster et al., 2001). This is to
be contrasted with the variation of 15% obtained in a smaller
number of experiments (all with fixed clouds) by Ramaswamy and
Chen (1997b). However, in a general sense and considering
arbitrary forcing types, the variation in 2 could be substantially
higher (50% or more) and the climate response much more

is defined for the transition of the surface-troposphere system from
one equilibrium state to another in response to an externally
imposed radiative perturbation. In the one-dimensional radiative-
convective models, wherein the concept was first initiated, 4 is a
nearly invariant parameter (typically, about 0.5 K/(Wm);
Ramanathan et al., 1985) for a variety of radiative forcings, thus
introducing the notion of a possible universality of the relationship
between forcing and response. It is this feature which has enabled
the radiative forcing to be perceived as a useful tool for obtaining
first-order estimates of the relative climate impacts of different
imposed radiative perturbations. Although the value of the
parameter “A” can vary from one model to another, within each
model it is found to be remarkably constant for a wide range of
radiative perturbations (WMO, 1986). The invariance of A has
made the radiative forcing concept appealing as a convenient
measure to estimate the global, annual mean surface temperature
response, without taking the recourse to actually run and analyse,
say, a three-dimensional atmosphere-ocean general circulation
model (AOGCM) simulation.

Although the radiative forcing concept was originally
formulated for the global, annual mean climate system, over the
past decade, it has been extended to smaller spatial domains (zonal
mean), and smaller time-averaging periods (seasons) in order to
deal with short-lived species that have a distinct geographical and
seasonal character, e.g., aerosols and O; (see also the SAR). The
global, annual average forcing estimate for these species masks the
inhomogeneity in the problem such that the anticipated global
mean response (via Equation 6.1) may not be adequate for gauging
the spatial pattern of the actual climate change. For these classes
of radiative perturbations, it is incorrect to assume that the charac-
teristics of the responses would be necessarily co-located with the
forcing, or that the magnitudes would follow the forcing patterns
exactly (e.g., Cox et al., 1995; Ramaswamy and Chen, 1997b).

In gauging the relative climatic significance of different
forcings, an important question is whether they have similar
climate sensitivities. As discussed in Section 6.2.1, while models
indicate a reasonable similarity of climate sensitivities for spatially
homogeneous forcings (e.g., CO, changes, solar irradiance
changes), it is not possible as yet to make a generalisation
applicable to all the spatially inhomogeneous forcing types. In
some cases, the climate sensitivity differs significantly from that
for CO; changes while, for some other cases, detailed studies have
yet to be conducted. A related question is whether the linear
additivity concept mentioned above can be extended to include all

individual forcings yields the correct total climate response. As

subsets of the relevant forcings.

Zonal mean and regional scale responses S for spatially
inhomogeneous forcings can differ considerably from those for
homogeneous forcings. Cox et al. (1995) and Taylor and Penner
(1994) conclude that the spatially inhomogeneous sulphate aerosol
direct forcing in the northern mid-latitudes tends to yield a signif-
icant response there that is absent in the spatially homogeneous
case. Using a series of idealised perturbations, Ramaswamy and
Chen (1997b) show that the gradient of the equator-to-pole surface
temperature response to spatially homogeneous and inhomo-
geneous forcings is significantly different when scaled with
respect to the global mean forcing, indicating that the more
spatially confined the forcing, the greater the meridional gradient
of the temperature response. In the context of the additive nature
of the regional temperature change signature, Penner et al. (1997)
suggest that there may be some limit to the magnitude of the

forcings that yield a linear signal.

The effect of stratospheric temperature adjustment also
differs between the various well-mixed greenhouse gases, owing
to different gas optical depths, spectral overlap with other gases,
and the vertical profiles in the stratosphere. The stratospheric
temperature adjustment reduces the radiative forcing due to CO,
by about 15% (Hansen et al., 1997a). CH, and N>O estimates are
slightly modified by the stratospheric temperature adjustment,

Trapping of the long-wave radiation due to the presence of
clouds reduces the radiative forcing of the greenhouse gases
compared to the clear-sky forcing. However, the magnitude of the
effect due to clouds varies for different greenhouse gases.
Relative to clear skies, clouds reduce the global mean radiative
forcing due to CO, by about 15% (Pinnock et al., 1995; Myhre

of the greenhouse gases on the radiative forcing. For CH, (a well-
mixed greenhouse gas), the assumption that it is well-mixed

Several previous studies of radiative forcing due to well-
mixed greenhouse gases have been performed using single,
mostly global mean, vertical profiles. Myhre and Stordal (1997)
investigated the effects of spatial and temporal averaging on the
globally and annually averaged radiative forcing due to the well-
mixed greenhouse gases. The use of a single global mean vertical
profile to represent the global domain, instead of the more
rigorous latitudinally varying profiles, can lead to errors of about
5 to 10%; errors arising due to the temporal averaging process are
much less (~1%). Freckleton et al. (1998) found similar effects
and suggested three vertical profiles which could represent global
atmospheric conditions satisfactorily in radiative transfer calcula-
tions. In the above two studies as well as in Forster et al. (1997),
it is the dependence of the radiative forcing on the tropopause
height and thereby also the vertical temperature profile, that
constitutes the main reason for the need of a latitudinal resolution
in radiative forcing calculations. The radiative forcing due to
halocarbons depends on the tropopause height more than is the
case for CO, (Forster et al., 1997; Myhre and Stordal, 1997).

"Radiative transfer calculations are performed with different
types of radiative transfer schemes ranging from line-by-line
models to band models (IPCC, 1994). Evans and Puckrin (1999)
have performed surface measurements of downward spectral
radiances which reveal the optical characteristics of individual
greenhouse gases. These measurements are compared with line-
by-line calculations. The agreement between the surface
measurements and the line-by-line model is within 10% for the
most important of the greenhouse gases: CO,, CHy, Nx0, CFC-
11 and CFC-12. This is not a direct test of the irradiance change
at the tropopause and thus of the radiative forcing, but the good
agreement does offer verification of fundamental radiative
transfer knowledge as represented by the line-by-line (LBL)

as several radiative forcing determinations which employ coarser
spectral resolution models use the LBL as a benchmark tool

in spectroscopic data, stratospheric adjustment, and decay of the
mixing ratio in the stratosphere are all found to be small effects.
However, effects of clouds and different radiation schemes are
potential sources for the difference between the newer estimates
and the SAR. A value of 0.15 Wm is now suggested for the
radiative forcing due to N,O, taking into account an increase in

The new best estimate based on the published results for the

areduction of 15% compared to the SAR. The forcing since pre-
industrial times in the SAR was estimated to be 1.56 Wm”; this

CFC-12 is investigated in Hansen er al. (1997a), Myhre et al.

al. (2000). The difference in the results is up to 20% which is due
to differing impact of clouds, absorption cross-section data, and the
vertical profile of decay of the mixing ratio in the stratosphere.
The radiative forcing due to CFC-12 of 0.32 Wm ppbv! used in
WMO (1999) is retained, which is slightly higher than the SAR
value. The present radiative forcing due to CFC-12 is therefore
0.17 Wm, which is the third highest forcing among the well-

While an updating of the simplified expressions to account

for the stratospheric adjustment becomes necessary for radiative
forcing estimates, it is noted that GCM simulations of CO,-
induced climate effects already account for this physical effect
implicitly (see also Chapter 9). In some climate studies, the sum
of the non-CO, well-mixed greenhouse gases forcing is
represented by that due to an equivalent amount of CO,. Because
the CO, forcing in the SAR was higher than the new estimate, the
use of the equivalent CO, concept would underestimate the
impact of the non-CO) well-mixed gases, if the IPCC values of
radiative forcing were used in the scaling operation.

"The SAR reported that several studies found a higher forcing due
to CH, than IPCC (1990), up to 20%; however the recommenda-
tion was to use the same value as in IPCC (1990). The higher
radiative forcing estimates were obtained using band models.
Recent calculations using LBL and band models confirm these
results (Lelieveld et al., 1998; Minschwaner et al., 1998; Jain et
al., 2000). Using two band models, Myhre et al. (1998b) found
the computed radiative forcing to differ by almost 10%. This was
attributed to difficulties in the treatment of CH, in band models
since, given its present abundance, the CH, absorption lies
between the weak line and the strong line limits (Ramanathan et
al., 1987). After updating for a small increase in concentration
since the SAR, the radiative forcing due to CH, is 0.48 Wm?
since pre-industrial times. This estimate for forcing due to CH, is
only for the direct effect of CH,; for radiative forcing of the
indirect effect of CHy, see Sections 6.5 and 6.6.

"The SAR referred to Pinnock er al. (1995), who obtained a higher
radiative forcing for CFC-11 than used in previous IPCC reports,
but refrained from changing the recommended value pending
further investigations. Since then several papers have investigated
CFC-11, confirming the higher forcing value (Christidis er al.,
1997; Hansen et al., 1997a; Myhre and Stordal, 1997; Good et
al., 1998; Myhre er al., 1998b; Jain et al., 2000) with a range
from 0.24 to 0.29 Wm~ ppbv~!. As mentioned above, Christidis
et al. (1997) found a large discrepancy in the absorption data for
CFC-11 in the literature. Other causes for the difference in the
radiative forcing are different treatments of the decrease in
mixing ratio in the stratosphere and the fact that some estimates
are performed with a single global mean column atmospheric
profile. Taking these effects into account, a radiative efficiency
due to CFC-11 of 0.25 Wm ppbv is used, the same value as in
WMO (1999). For the present concentration of CFC-11, this
yields a forcing of 0.07 Wm since pre-industrial times. In
previous IPCC reports, radiative forcing due to CFCs and their
replacements have been given relative to CFC-11. CFC-11 is now
revised and this introduces a complicating factor since the
radiative forcing for the CFCs and CFC replacements are given
as absolute values in some studies, but relative to CFC-11 in
others. WMO (1999) updated several of the halocarbons giving
radiative forcing in absolute values (in Wm~ ppbv~!).

uncertainty in N,O (Section 6.3.2) is similar to that for CO,

some of the less investigated molecules (Section 6.3.3). A small
increase in the concentrations of the well-mixed greenhouse
gases since the SAR has compensated for the reduction in
radiative forcing resulting from improved radiative transfer
calculations. The rate of increase in the well-mixed greenhouse
gas concentrations, and thereby the radiative forcing, has been
smaller over the first half of the 1990s compared to previous
decades (see also Hansen et al., 1998). This is mainly a result of
reduced growth in CO, and CH, concentrations and smaller

"We reiterate both the concept of the forcing for stratospheric
O; changes and the fact that this has led to a negative radiative
forcing since the late 1970s. Further, the model-based estimates
that necessarily rely on satellite observations of O; losses are
likely the most reliable means to derive the forcing, notwith-
standing the uncertainty in the vertical profile of loss in the
vicinity of the tropopause. Since several model estimates have
employed the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS)
observations as one of the inputs for the calculations, there is the
likelihood of a small tropospheric O; change component contam-
inating the stratospheric O3 loss amounts, especially for the
lowermost regions of the lower stratosphere (Hansen et al.,
1997a; Shine and Forster, 1999). Both the estimates derived in
the earlier IPCC assessments and the studies since the SAR show
that the forcing pattern increases from the mid- to high latitudes

adjustment of the stratosphere to a new thermal equilibrium state
is a critical element for estimating the sign and magnitude of the
forcing due to stratospheric O; loss (WMO, 1992, 1995). While
the computational procedures are well established for the FDH
and SEFDH approximations in the context of the surface-
troposphere forcing, one test of the approximations lies in the
comparison of the computed with observed temperature changes,
since it is this factor that plays a large role in the estimate of the
forcing. While the temperature changes going into the determi-
nation of the forcing are broadly consistent with the observations,
there are challenges in comparing quantitatively the actual
temperature changes (which undoubtedly are affected by other
influences and may even contain feedbacks due to O; and other
forcings) with the FDH or SEFDH model simulations (which
necessarily do not contain feedback effects other than the strato-
spheric temperature response due to the essentially radiative

It is is logical to enquire into the realism of the computed
coolings with the available observations using models more
realistic than FDH/SEFDH, namely GCMs. Furthermore,
comparison of the FDH and SEFDH derived temperature
changes with those from a GCM constitutes another test of the
approximations. WMO (1999) concluded, on the basis of
intercomparisons of the temperature records as measured by
different instruments, that there has been a distinct cooling of the
global mean temperature of the lower stratosphere over the past
two decades, with a value of about 0.5°C/decade. Model simula-
tions from GCMs using the observed O; losses yield global mean
temperature changes that are approximately consistent with the
observations. Such a cooling is also much larger than that due to
the well-mixed greenhouse gases taken together over the same
time period. Although the possibility of other trace species also
contributing to this cooling cannot be ruled out, the consistency
between observations and model simulations enhances the
general principle of an O3-induced cooling of the lower strato-
sphere, and thus the negativity of the radiative forcing due to the

"The observed stratospheric O; losses over the past two decades
have caused a negative forcing of the surface-troposphere system
(IPCC, 1992, 1994; SAR). In general, the sign and magnitude of
the forcing due to stratospheric O3 loss are governed by the
vertical profile of the O3 loss from the lower through to the upper
stratosphere (WMO, 1999). Ozone depletion in the lower strato-
sphere, which occurs mainly in the mid- to high latitudes is the
principal component of the forcing. It causes an increase in the
solar forcing of the surface-troposphere system. However, the
long-wave effects consist of a reduction of the emission from the
stratosphere to the troposphere. This comes about due to the O;
loss, coupled with a cooling of the stratospheric temperatures in
the stratospheric adjustment process, with a colder stratosphere
emitting less radiation. The long-wave effects, after adjustment of
the stratospheric temperatures to the imposed perturbation,
overwhelm the solar effect i.e., the negative long-wave forcing
prevails over the positive solar to lead to a net negative radiative
forcing of the surface-troposphere system (IPCC, 1992). The
magnitude of the forcing is dependent on the loss in the lower
stratosphere, with the estimates subject to some uncertainties in
view of the fact that detailed observations on the vertical profile
in this region of the atmosphere are difficult to obtain.

their excellent agreement with explicit radiative transfer calcula-
tions, are strong bases for their continued usage, albeit with
revised values of the constants, as listed in Table 6.2. Shi (1992)
has suggested more physically based and accurate expressions
which account for (i) additional absorption bands that could yield
a separate functional form besides the one in IPCC (1990), and
(ii) a better treatment of the overlap between gases. WMO (1999)
used a simplified expression for CO, based on Hansen et al.
(1988) and this simplified expression is used in the calculations
of GWP in Section 6.12. For CO, the simplified expressions from
Shi (1992) and Hansen et al. (1988) are also listed alongside the
IPCC (1990)-like expression for CO, in Table 6.2. Compared to
IPCC (1990) and the SAR and for similar changes in the concen-
trations of well-mixed greenhouse gases, the improved simplified
expressions result in a 15% decrease in the estimate of the
radiative forcing by CO, (first row in Table 6.2), a 15% decrease
in the case of N30, an increase of 10 to 15% in the case of CFC-
11 and CFC-12, and no change in the case of CHy.

Clearly, since WMO (1992), this forcing has been investi-
gated in an intensive manner using different approaches, and the
observational evidence of the O} losses, including the spatial and
seasonal characteristics, are now on a firmer footing. In arriving
at a best estimate for the forcing, we rely essentially on the
studies that have made use of stratospheric O; observations
directly. Based on this consideration, we adopt here a forcing of
—0.15 + 0.1 Wm for the 1979 to 1997 period. However, it is
cautioned that the small values obtained by the two specific

Hansen et al. (1997a) have extended the calculations to
include the O; loss up to the mid-1990s and performed a variety
of O; loss experiments to investigate the forcing and response. In
particular, they obtained forcings of —0.2 and -0.28 Wm? for the
period 1979 to 1994 using SAGE/TOMS and SAGE/SBUV
satellite data, respectively. Hansen et al. (1998) updated their
forcing to -0.2 Wm? with an uncertainty of 0.1 Wm for the
period 1970 to present. Forster and Shine (1997) obtained
forcings of -0.17 Wm and -0.22 Wm"" for the period 1979 to
1996 using SAGE and SBUV observations, respectively. The
WMO (1999) assessment gave a value of —0.2 Wm~ with an
uncertainty of + 0.15 Wm for the period from late 1970s to mid-
1990s. Forster and Shine (1997) have also extended the computa-
tions back to 1964 using O3 changes deduced from surface-based
observations; combining these with an assumption that the
decadal rate of change of forcing from 1979 to 1991 was
sustained to the mid-1990s yielded a total stratospheric O;
forcing of about —0.23 Wm. Shine and Forster (1999) have
revised this value to —0.15 Wm for the period 1979 to 1997,
choosing not to include the values prior to 1979 in view of the lack
of knowledge on the vertical profile which makes the sign of the
change also uncertain. They also revised the uncertainty to + 0.12

"1998). The main difficulty is that the temperature change in the
vicinity of the lower stratosphere critically affects the emission
from the stratosphere into the troposphere. Thus any uncertainty
in the MSU satellite retrieval induced by the broad altitude
weighting function (see WMO, 1999) becomes an important
factor in the estimation of the forcing. Further, the degree of
response of the climate system, embedded in the observed
temperature change (i.e., feedbacks), is not resolved in an easy
manner. This makes it difficult to distinguish quantitatively the
part of temperature change that is a consequence of the strato-
spheric adjustment process (which would be, by definition, a
legitimate component of the forcing estimate) and that which is
due to mechanisms other than O; loss. Thus, using observed
temperatures to estimate the forcing may be more uncertain than
the model-based estimates. It must be noted though that both
methods share the difficulty of quantifying the vertical and
geographical distributions of the O; changes near the tropopause,
and the rigorous association of this to the observed temperature
changes. In an overall sense, it is a difficult task to verify the
radiative forcing in cases where the stratospheric adjustment
yields a dramatically different result than the instantaneous
forcing i.e., where the species changes affect stratospheric
temperatures and alter substantially the long-wave radiative
effects at the tropopause. A related point is the possible upward
movement of the tropopause which could explain in part the
observed negative trends in O; and temperature (Fortuin and
Kelder, 1996).

cognisant of the role played by the vertical profile of O3 loss

static, eventually tending to become less negative. At this time,
there will be a lesser offset of the positive greenhouse effects of
the halocarbons and the other well-mixed greenhouse gases
(WMO, 1999). Solomon and Daniel (1996) point out that the
global mean stratospheric O3 forcing can be expected to scale
down substantially in importance relative to the well-mixed
greenhouse gases, in view of the former’s decline and the latter’s
sustained increase in concentrations. Note, however, that the
evolution of the negativity of the stratospheric O; forcing may
vary considerably with latitude and season i.e., the recovery may
not occur at all locations and seasons at the same rate. Thus, the
spatial and seasonal evolution of forcing in the future requires as
much scrutiny as the global mean estimate.

"Human activities have long been known to influence tropospheric
O3, not only in urban areas where O3 is a major component of
‘smog’, but also in the remote atmosphere (e.g., IPCC, 1990,
1994; the SAR and references therein). The current state of
scientific understanding of tropospheric O3 chemistry and trends
is reviewed in Chapter 4 of this report, where it is emphasised that
tropospheric O; has an average lifetime of the order of weeks.
This relatively short lifetime implies that the distribution of
tropospheric O3, as well as the trends in that distribution (which
in turn lead to radiative forcing) are highly variable in space and
time. Studies relating to the evaluation of radiative forcing due to
estimated tropospheric O; increases since pre-industrial times are
discussed here. While there are a number of sites where high
quality surface measurements of O3 have been obtained for a few
decades, there are fewer locations where ozonesonde data allow
study of the vertical distribution of the trends, and fewer still with
records prior to about 1970. A limited number of surface measure-
ments in Europe date back to the late 19th century. These suggest
that O; has more than tripled in the 20th century there (Marenco
et al., 1994). The lack of global information on pre-industrial
tropospheric O; distributions is, however, a major uncertainty in
the evaluation of the forcing of this key gas (see Chapter 4).

"An important issue is whether the actual surface temperature
responses to the forcing by stratospheric O; has the same
relationship with forcing as obtained for, say, CO, or solar
constant changes. Hansen et al. (1997a) and Christiansen (1999)
have performed a host of GCM experiments to test this concept.
The forcing by lower stratospheric Oj is an unusual one in that it
has a positive short-wave and a negative long-wave radiative
forcing. Moreover, it has a unique vertical structure owing to the
fact that the short-wave effects are felt at the surface while the
long-wave is felt only initially at the upper troposphere
(Ramanathan and Dickinson, 1979; WMO, 1992). Compared to,
say, CO, change, the stratospheric O; forcing is not global in
extent, being very small in the tropics and increasing from mid-
to high latitudes; the O; forcing also differs in its vertical
structure, since the radiative forcings for CO, change in both the
troposphere and surface are of the same sign (WMO, 1986). The
relationship between the global mean forcing and response
differs by less than 20% for O3 profiles, resembling somewhat the
actual losses (Hansen et al., 1997a). However, serious departures
occur if the O; changes are introduced near surface layers when
the lapse rate change, together with cloud feedbacks, make the
climate sensitivity quite different from the nominal values. There
also occur substantial differences in the climate sensitivity
parameter for O; losses in the upper stratosphere. This is further
substantiated by Christiansen (1999) who shows that the higher
climate sensitivity for upper stratospheric O; losses relative to
lower stratospheric depletion is related to the vertical partitioning
of the forcing, in particular the relative roles of short-wave and
long-wave radiation in the surface-troposphere system. It is
encouraging that the global mean climate sensitivity parameter
for cases involving lower stratospheric O3 changes and that for
CO, changes (viz., doubling) are reasonably similar in
Christiansen (1999) while being within about 25% of a central
value in Hansen et al. (1997a). An energy balance model study
(Bintanja et al., 1997) suggests a stronger albedo feedback for O;
changes than for CO, perturbations (see also WMO, 1999).

linear, so that increased emissions of, for example, the nitric
oxide precursor do not necessarily lead to linear responses in O3
concentrations over all ranges of likely values (e.g, Kleinman,
1994; Klonecki and Levy, 1997). Further, the relationship of
precursor emissions to O3 trends may also vary in time. One
study suggests that the O3 production efficiency per mole of
nitrogen oxide emitted has decreased globally by a factor of two
since pre-industrial times (Wang and Jacob, 1998). Because of
these complex and poorly understood interactions, the forcing
due to tropospheric O3 trends cannot be reliably and uniquely
attributed in a quantitative fashion to the emissions of specific

For the purposes of this report, several evaluations of the
global radiative forcing due to tropospheric O3 changes since
pre-industrial times have been intercompared. It will be shown
that the uncertainties in radiative forcing can be better
understood when both the absolute radiative forcing (Wm~*)
and normalised forcing (Wm per Dobson Unit of tropospheric
O; change) are considered. The results of this intercomparison
and the availability of numerous models using different
approaches suggest reduced uncertainties in the radiative
forcing estimates compared to those of the SAR. Furthermore,
recent work has shown that the dependence of the forcing on the
altitude where the O; changes occur within the troposphere is
less pronounced than previously thought, providing improved
scientific understanding. Finally, some estimates of the likely
magnitude of future tropospheric O; radiative forcing are
presented and discussed.

"The dependence of surface temperature response on the height of
an imposed constant change in O; amount (often 10 Dobson
Units, or DU) can be estimated using radiative convective models
(e.g., Wang ef al., 1980; Lacis et al., 1990; Forster and Shine,
1997). Figure 6.la shows the results of such a calculation. This
figure suggests that surface temperature is particularly sensitive
to O3 trends near 8 to 15 km, in the vicinity of the tropopause.
However, Forster and Shine (1997) made the important point that
since there is far less O3; in the troposphere than near the
tropopause and in the stratosphere, the use of a constant pertur-
bation is unlikely to provide a realistic measure of the sensitivity
profile. For example, 10 DU corresponds to roughly a 400%
increase in mid-tropospheric O3, but much less at higher levels.
Figure 6.1b shows how a 10% (rather than 10 DU) local O;
perturbation affects the calculated surface temperature as a
function of the altitude where the O; change is imposed (from
Forster and Shine, 1997). This figure suggests that the sensitivity
of surface temperature to the altitude of O3 perturbations is
considerably smaller than suggested by earlier studies that
employed constant absolute changes to probe these effects. While
the study of Forster and Shine (1997) employed a simple
radiative/convective model, Hansen ef al. (1997a) carried out
similar calculations using a GCM. Their study suggests that
cloud feedbacks could further lower the altitude at which surface
temperature is most sensitive to O3 perturbations (Hansen et al.,
1997a; WMO, 1999), but this work employed perturbations of 10

understanding of the normalised forcing. The difference between
the normalised tropical and mid-latitude forcings also emphasises
the need to quantify both the O; produced by biomass burning
(and other tropical processes), and that produced by industrial
practices, especially in the northern hemisphere. Some of the
studies in Figure 6.2 suggest, for example, that a model
producing larger O3 changes in the tropics could produce a
greater globally averaged tropospheric O3 forcing than one
producing larger changes in northern mid-latitudes, even if the
globally averaged O; increases in the two studies were identical.
Overall, this Figure suggests that the differences between model
estimates of tropospheric O; forcing since pre-industrial times
are likely to be dominated by chemistry (e.g., emission invento-
ries, chemical processes, and transport) rather than by factors
relating to radiative transfer.

In contrast to CHy, the direct radiative forcing of CO is
relatively small (Evans and Puckrin, 1995; Sinha and Toumi,
1996). Sinha and Toumi (1996) have estimated a clear sky
radiative forcing of 0.024 Wm for a uniform increase in CO
from 25 ppbv to 100 ppbv. However, CO plays a primary role in
governing OH abundances in the troposphere. As indicated by
Prather (1994, 1996) and Daniel and Solomon (1998), CO
emissions into the atmosphere may have a significant impact on
climate forcing due to chemical impact on CH, lifetime, and
tropospheric O3 and CO, photochemical production (see Chapter
4). The contribution of these indirect effects to the GWPs based
on box model calculations are presented in Section 6.12.

"In addition to the direct forcings caused by injection of
radiatively active gases to the atmosphere, some compounds or
processes can also modify the radiative balance through indirect
effects relating to chemical transformation or change in the distri-
bution of radiatively active species. As previously indicated
(IPCC, 1992, 1994; SAR), the tropospheric chemical processes
determining the indirect greenhouse effects are highly complex
and not fully understood. The uncertainties connected with
estimates of the indirect effects are larger than the uncertainties
of those connected to estimates of the direct effects. Because of
the central role that O; and OH play in tropospheric chemistry,
the chemistry of CH4, CO, NMHC, and NO, is strongly
intertwined, making the interpretation of the effects associated
with emission changes rather complex. It should be noted that
indirect effects involving OH feedback on the lifetime of well-
mixed greenhouse gases, and tropospheric O3 concentration
changes since the pre-industrial are implicitly accounted for in
Sections 6.3 and 6.5.

"Increased penetration of ultraviolet radiation into the troposphere
as a result of stratospheric ozone depletion leads to changes in the
photodissociation rates of some key chemical species. One of the
primary species affected by possible changes in photodissocia-
tion rates is the hydroxy] radical OH, which regulates the tropos-
pheric lifetime of a large number of trace gases such as CHy, CO,
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs),
NO,, and to a lesser extent, sulphur dioxide (SO) (see Chapter
4). The impact of stratospheric O; changes on the fate of tropo-
spheric species has been discussed by Ma and van Weele (2000),
Fuglestvedt et al. (1994), Bekki et al. (1994); and Fuglestvedt et
al. (1995); on the basis of two-dimensional model simulations,
and by Madronich and Granier (1994), Granier er al. (1996), Van
Dop and Krol (1996) and Krol ef al. (1998) using three-
dimensional models. These studies and the updated calculations
presented by WMO (1999) estimated that a 1% decrease in
global total O3 leads to a global increase in O3 photolysis rate
of 1.4%, resulting in a 0.7 to 0.8% increase in global OH.
Changes in photolysis rates from reduced stratospheric O3;
also have the potential to alter tropospheric O3 production and
destruction rates. Based on stratospheric O} evolution over the
period 1980 to 1996, Myhre ef al. (2000) have calculated a
reduction in tropospheric O3 associated with increased ultra-
violet penetration and a corresponding negative radiative
forcing reaching —0.01 Wm over that period of time.

"CH, is oxidised primarily (>90%) in the troposphere through
reaction with OH. Since the CHy oxidation cycle provides a
substantial fraction of the OH loss in the troposphere, there is
strong interaction between OH and CHy,. This causes the OH to
decrease when CH, increases, leading to a further increase in
CHy,. This chemical feedback is examined in Chapter 4. Lelieveld
and Crutzen (1992), Briihl (1993), Lelieveld et al. (1993, 1998),
Hauglustaine et al. (1994) and Fuglestvedt et al. (1996) estimated
that this feedback added 25 to 35% to the direct CH, forcing
depending on the initial CH, perturbation and the model used.
These values are in line with the 30% contribution estimated by
IPCC (1992) and the SAR. The tropospheric O; increase
associated with photochemical production from the CH,
oxidation cycle also contributes to enhancing the total CHy
radiative forcing. The forcing from enhanced levels of tropo-
spheric O; estimated by Lelieveld and Crutzen (1992),
Lelieveld et al. (1993, 1998), Hauglustaine et al. (1994) and
Fuglestvedt et al. (1996) contributes a further 30 to 40% on top
of the CH, forcing, due directly to CH, emissions. IPCC (1992)
estimated a lower contribution of O3; of approximately 20%.
Lelieveld et al. (1998) have estimated a direct radiative forcing
associated with CH, increase since the pre-industrial era (1850 to
1992) of 0.33 Wm and an additional forcing of 0.11 Wm?
associated with OH feedback. The increased tropospheric O;
contributes an additional 0.11 Wm and stratospheric H,O
another 0.02 Wm. These authors found that the total CH,
forcing (0.57 Wm”) is higher by 73% than the direct forcing.
The CH, radiative forcing given in Section 6.3 (0.5 Wm) and
based on recorded CH, concentration increase includes both the
direct and OH indirect contributions. This updated forcing is
higher by 14% than the 0.44 Wm obtained by Lelieveld et al.
(1998) on the basis of calculated present day and pre-industrial
CH, distributions. In addition to that, oxidation of CH, also leads
to the formation of CO, providing a further indirect effect.

Aircraft emissions also have the potential to alter the
composition of the atmosphere and induce a radiative forcing of
climate. According to IPCC (1999), in 1992 the NO, emissions
from subsonic aircraft are estimated to have increased O3
concentrations at cruise altitudes in the Northern Hemisphere
mid-latitude summer by about 6% compared with an atmosphere
without aircraft. The associated global mean radiative forcing is
0.023 Wm. In addition to increasing tropospheric O3, aircraft
NO, are expected to decrease the concentration of CH, inducing
a negative radiative forcing of -0.014 Wm for the 1992 aircraft
fleet. Again, due to different O; and CH, lifetimes, the two
forcings show very different spatial distribution and seasonal
evolution (IPCC, 1999). The O3 forcing shows a marked
maximum at northern mid-latitudes, reaching 0.06 Wm, whilst
the CH, forcing exhibits a more uniform distribution, with a
maximum of about —0.02 Wm? in the tropical regions. Based on
IPCC (1999), the O; forcing calculated for 2050 conditions is
0.060 Wm? and the CH, forcing is —0.045 Wm.

Deep convection can remove pollutants from the lower
atmosphere and inject them rapidly into the middle and upper
troposphere and, occasionally, into the stratosphere. Changes in
convective regimes associated with climate changes have
therefore the potential to significantly modify the distribution and
the photochemistry of O3 in a region where its impact on the

of NO, in the troposphere and thus contributes to the
photochemical production of O3 (Huntrieser et al., 1998; Wang
et al., 1998; Hauglustaine et al., 2001; Lelieveld and Dentener,
2000). In the tropical mid- and upper troposphere, modelling
studies by Lamarque et al. (1996), Levy et al. (1996), Penner et
al. (1998a), and Allen et al. (2000) have calculated a contribu-
tion of lightning to the NO, levels of 60 to 90% during summer.
Direct observations by Solomon et al. (1999) of absorption of
visible radiation indicate that nitrogen dioxide can lead to local
instantaneous radiative forcing exceeding 1 Wm. These
enhancements of NO, absorption are likely to be due both to
pollution and to production by lightning in convective clouds.
Further measurements are required to bracket the direct radiative
forcing by NO, under a variety of storm and pollution conditions.
On the basis of two-dimensional model calculations, Toumi et al.
(1996) calculated that for a 20% increase of lightning the global
mean radiative forcing by enhanced tropospheric O; production
is about 0.1 Wm. Based on an apparent correlation between
lightning strike rates and surface temperatures, Sinha and
Toumi (1997) have suggested a positive climate feedback
through O; production from lightning NO, in a warmer climate.
Improved modelling and observations are required to confirm
this hypothesis.

"Through production of tropospheric O3, emissions of nitrogen
oxides (NO, = NO + NO3) lead to a positive radiative forcing of

reduce the levels of CH,, providing a negative forcing (cooling)

photochemical production together with differences in mixing
regimes and removal processes, the O; and OH changes strongly
depend on the localisation of the NO, surface emission perturba-

weeks. Based on three-dimensional model results, Fuglestvedt et

this study, a time variation and a flattening of the trend has been
determined after 1996. This stratospheric H,O increase is well
above that expected from the rising CH, levels in the
atmosphere. Based on these observed stratospheric HO trends,
Forster and Shine (1999) have estimated a radiative forcing of
0.2 Wm since 1980. Note that, just as for stratospheric O3,
there exists considerable uncertainty concerning the trend near
the tropopause region globally. It should also be noted that if the
changes in water vapour were a result of CH, oxidation, the
changes in H,O would be a forcing. However, if they result
from changes in tropical tropopause temperature change or in
dynamics, then they should be viewed as a feedback (as defined
in Section 6.2). Additional measurements and analyses are
clearly needed to explain the observed trends.

annual mean Northern Hemisphere/Southern Hemisphere

the annual mean radiative forcing over land to that over ocean
also varies considerably, ranging from 1.3 (Kiehl et al., 2000) to
3.4 (Boucher and Anderson, 1995). The direct radiative forcing
(DRF) is strongest in the Northern Hemisphere summer when the
insolation is the highest although different seasonal cycles of the
sulphate burden from the chemical transport models result in
maximum global mean radiative forcings ranging from May to
August (e.g., Haywood and Ramaswamy, 1998), the ratio of the

the radiative forcings can be isolated from the uncertainties in
the simulated sulphate loadings by considering the range in the
normalised radiative forcing i.e., the radiative forcing per unit
mass of sulphate aerosol (e.g., Nemesure et al., 1995; Pilinis et

Boucher and Anderson (1995) investigate the effects of
different size distributions, finding a 20 to 30% variation in the
radiative forcing for reasonable size distributions. Nemesure et
al. (1995) and Boucher et al. (1998) find a much larger sensitivity
to the assumed size distribution as sulphate is modelled by much
narrower size distributions. Column radiative forcing calculations
by fifteen radiative transfer codes of varying complexity
(Boucher et al., 1998) show that, for well constrained input data,
differences in the computed radiative forcing when clouds are
excluded are relatively modest at approximately 20% (see Figure
6.3). This indicates that uncertainties in the input parameters and
in the implementation of the radiative transfer codes and the
inclusion of clouds lead to the large spread in estimates as
suggested by Penner et al. (1994).

mean ECMWF analyses, resulting in a larger normalised
radiative forcing. Ghan et al. (2001a) perform a sensitivity study
and find that application of GCM relative humidities changes the
direct radiative forcing by -0.2 Wm? compared to the use of
ECMWFE analyses because the frequency of occurrence of
relative humidities over 90% is higher when using GCM relative
humidities. Haywood and Ramaswamy’s (1998) GCM study
indicates a stronger radiative forcing when sulphate resides near
the surface because the relative humidity and subsequent
hygroscopic growth of sulphate particles is higher. GCM
sensitivity studies (Boucher and Anderson, 1995) and column
calculations (Nemesure et al., 1995) show that the radiative
forcing is a strong function of relative humidity but relatively
insensitive to chemical composition. Ghan et al. (2001a) suggest
a number of reasons for the relatively low DRF from their study,
including the relatively large fraction of anthropogenic sulphate
in winter when the insolation is lowest, and the fact that sulphate
aerosols are smaller in this study and therefore have smaller
scattering efficiencies (see also Boucher and Anderson, 1995).

"On the basis of the calculations summarised above, the
estimate of the global mean radiative forcing for BC aerosols
from fossil fuels is revised to +0.2 Wm (from +0.1 Wm?) with
a range +0.1 to +0.4 Wm”. The significant contribution to the
global annual mean radiative forcing from cloudy regions is the
main reason for the increase in the radiative forcing since the
SAR. Uncertainties in determining the radiative forcing lie in
modelling the mixing of BC with hygroscopic aerosols and the
subsequent wet deposition processes which consequently
influence the modelled atmospheric lifetime and burden of BC
aerosol. Additionally, mixing of BC with other aerosol types and
cloud droplets influences the optical parameters.

"Anthropogenic organic aerosols are a by-product of fossil fuel
and biomass combustion and they consist of many complex
chemical compounds and are released either as primary aerosol
particles or as volatile organic gases (see Chapter 5). Studies that
investigate the radiative forcing due to organic carbon (OC) from
fossil fuels are included in Table 6.5. Penner ef al. (1998b) and
Grant et al. (1999) found a DRF of +0.16 Wm~ when modelling
the direct radiative forcing due to an internal mixture of fossil
fuel BC and OC, and +0.2Wm~ when modelling the radiative
forcing due to externally mixed fossil fuel BC. From these
results, an annual global mean radiative forcing of -0.04 Wm?
for fossil fuel OC from a global mean burden of approximately
0.7 mgm may be derived. However, if OC were modelled as an
external mixture with BC and/or if the effects of relative humidity
are included, the radiative forcing due to OC from fossil fuels is
likely to be more negative, thus this represents an approximate
weakest limit. An alternative method for calculating the DRF due
to fossil fuel OC from the results of Penner er al. (1998b) is to
note that the absorption is approximately doubled when BC is
modelled as an internal mixture rather than an external mixture
(e.g., Haywood et al., 1997a). Thus, for an external mixture of
fossil fuel OC a radiative forcing of -0.24 Wm~ may be more
appropriate. Cooke et al. (1999) performed GCM calculations
for externally mixed fossil fuel OC, finding a radiative forcing of
—0.02 Wm from a global mean burden of 0.34 mgm. Myhre
et al. (2001) scale the atmospheric concentrations of fossil fuel
OC to modelled sulphate aerosol concentrations and include
the effects of relative humidity to estimate a radiative forcing
of -0.09 Wm? from a global mean burden of 0.66 mgm. Thus,
modelling estimates suggest that the normalised radiative forcing
for OC is in the range —60 to -340 Wg""!, which is smaller in
magnitude than that due to BC due to the larger specific extinction
coefficient for BC and the fact that BC may exert a significant
radiative forcing in cloudy regions. Cooke et al. (1999) assume
that OC is partially absorbing with a modelled single scattering
albedo of approximately 0.97 at a wavelength of 0.55 um.
Hansen et al. (1998) use a three-dimensional GCM and the OC
distribution from Liousse et al. (1996) and estimate the
radiative forcing due to combined fossil fuel and biomass
sources to be -0.41 Wm. The approximate fraction of the
atmospheric burden of the fossil fuel component may be
estimated from the emission inventory of Liousse et al. (1996)

Penner et al. (1998b) and Grant et al. (1999) used a chemical
transport model in conjunction with a GCM to estimate a global
column burden of BC from fossil fuel emissions of 0.16 mgm
and a radiative forcing of +0.20 Wm for an external mixture.
Cooke et al. (1999) estimated the global burden of optically active
BC aerosol from fossil fuel burning from a 1° by 1° inventory of
emissions to be 0.14 mgm (note the good agreement with the
assumed column burdens of Haywood et al. (1997a) and Myhre et
al. (1998c)) and a subsequent radiative forcing of +0.17 Wm”.
Haywood and Ramaswamy (1998) estimated the BC radiative
forcing due to fossil fuel and biomass burning to be approximately
+0.4 Wm (see also Section 6.7.5), approximately half of which
(40.2 Wm) is due to fossil fuel sources. Jacobson (2000, 2001)
modelled BC from both fossil fuels and biomass burning sources
and investigated the effects of different mixing schemes, finding a
direct radiative forcing of +0.54 Wm and a normalised direct
radiative forcing of 1,200 Wg~! when BC was modelled as an
absorbing spherical core. These studies suggest that the global
mean radiative forcing due to fossil fuel BC is strongest in
June/July/August owing to the larger insolation coupled with
higher atmospheric concentrations in the Northern Hemisphere.
From these studies the normalised radiative forcing for an external
mixture of BC aerosol appears better defined than for sulphate
aerosol ranging from +1,123 We""! to +1,525 We""!. However, all
these studies used the same size distribution and exclude effects of
relative humidity, thus the modelled specific extinction is
independent of the relative humidity at approximately 10 m2g7! at
0.55 um. Observational studies show a wide range of specific
extinction coefficients, Op, (See Section 5.1.2 and Table 5.1) of
approximately 5 to 20 mg""! at 0.55 um, thus the uncertainty in
the associated radiative forcing is likely to be higher than the
global model results suggest. Additionally, if BC were modelled
as an internal mixture, Haywood ef al. (1997a) and Myhre et al.
(1998c) suggest the degree of absorption may be considerably
enhanced, the radiative forcing being estimated as +0.36 Wm?
and +0.44 Wm, respectively. Both of these studies use relatively
simple effective medium mixing rules for determining the
composite refractive index of internally mixed BC with sulphate
and water which may overestimate the degree of absorption (e.g.,
Jacobson, 2000). Detailed scattering studies including a randomly
positioned black carbon sphere in a scattering droplet show that
the absorption is relatively well represented by effective medium
approximations (Chylek et al., 1996b). Column studies by
Haywood and Shine (1997) and Liao and Seinfeld (1998) and the
global studies by Haywood and Ramaswamy (1998) and Penner
et al. (1998b) suggest that the radiative forcing due to BC will be
enhanced if BC exists within or above the cloud, but reduced if the
BC is below the cloud; thus the vertical profile of BC aerosol must
be determined from observations and modelled accurately.

1996) and up to 30 to 50% (Tegen and Fung, 1995) of the total
mineral dust in the atmosphere originates from anthropogenic
activities, the precise fraction of mineral dust of anthropogenic
origin being extremely difficult to determine. Only the radiative
forcing from this anthropogenic component is considered as there
is no evidence that the naturally occurring component has
changed since 1750, although ice core measurements suggest that
atmospheric concentrations of dust have varied substantially over
longer time-scales (e.g., Petit, 1990). Because mineral dust
particles are of a relatively large size and because it becomes
lofted to high altitudes in the troposphere, in addition to the short-
wave radiative forcing, it may exert a significant long-wave
radiative forcing. The global mean short-wave radiative forcing
will be negative due to the predominantly scattering nature in the
solar spectrum (although partial absorption may lead to a local
positive radiative forcing over high surface albedos and clouds)
and the global mean long-wave forcing will be positive.

"Biomass burning aerosol consists of two major chemical
components: black carbon (BC), which primarily absorbs solar
radiation, and organic carbon (OC), which primarily scatters
solar radiation. Sources of biomass burning aerosol include
burning of forests and savanna for colonisation and agriculture,
burning of agricultural waste, and substances burned for fuel
such as wood, dung and peat. Not all biomass aerosol comes
from anthropogenic activities, as naturally occurring vegetation
fires regularly occur. The fraction of anthropogenic biomass
aerosol remains difficult to deduce. As for sulphate and fossil
fuel BC aerosol, three-dimensional GCM estimates (e.g., Penner
et al., 1998b) have superseded earlier simple box-model calcula-
tions (e.g., Penner et al., 1992) (see Table 6.5). Penner ef al.
(1998b) and Grant et al. (1999) used a GCM to model the
radiative forcing from biomass aerosol, finding a combined total
radiative forcing of —0.14 to —-0.23 Wm depending upon the
mixing assumptions and size distributions used. The radiative
forcing is calculated to be negative over the majority of the
globe, but some limited areas of positive forcing exist over areas
with a high surface reflectance (see Section 6.14.2). The
seasonal cycle is strongly influenced by the seasonal cycle o:
biomass burning emissions (Grant ef al., 1999; Iacobellis et al.,
1999), the global mean being estimated to be a maximum during
June/July/August. Hobbs et al. (1997) performed aircraft
measurements of smoke from biomass burning during the
Smoke Cloud and Radiation-Brazil (SCAR-B) experiment and
used the model of Penner et al. (1992) to estimate a global mean
radiative forcing of -0.3 Wm as an approximate upper limit
due to modified optical parameters. Ross et al. (1998) performed
a similar measurement and modelling study estimating a loca
annual mean radiative forcing of —-2 to -3 Wm"" in intensive
biomass burning regions, indicating that the global mean
radiative forcing is likely to be significantly smaller than in
Penner et al. (1992). Iacobellis et al. (1999) model the globa
radiative forcing as -0.7 Wm but use an emission factor for
biomass aerosols that Liousse et al. (1996) suggest is a factor o
three too high, thus a radiative forcing of -0.25 Wm is more
likely. These estimates neglect any long-wave radiative forcing
although Christopher et al. (1996) found a discernible signal in
AVHRR data from Brazilian forest fires that opposes the short-
wave radiative forcing; the magnitude of the long-wave signa
will depend upon the size, optical parameters, and altitude of the
aerosol.

One problem that needs to be solved is uncertainty in
representative refractive indices (Claquin et al., 1998), and how
they vary geographically due to different mineral composition
of different source regions (e.g., Lindberg et al., 1976). Sokolik

index for different geographic regions finding a range (—0.003i

Kaufman ef al. (2001) use observations from the Landsat

"Although IPCC (1994) identified nitrate aerosol as a significant
anthropogenic source of aerosol, only three estimates of the
radiative forcing are available. Van Dorland et al. (1997) has
produced a very speculative radiative forcing estimate of
approximately —0.03 Wm? for ammonium nitrate, while
Adams et al. (2001) derived a radiative forcing of -0.22 Wm
from an anthropogenic burden of 0.62 mg(NO3)m~, and
Jacobson (2001) derived a radiative forcing of approximately
-0.02 Wm for a column burden of 0.7 mg(NO;)m~. It
appears that the large discrepancy between the results of
Jacobson (2001) and Adams et al. (2001) is that 90% of the
nitrate is in the coarse mode in Jacobson (2001), which reduces
the scattering efficiency. Recent measurement studies by
Veefkind et al. (1996) and ten Brink et al. (1997) in the
Netherlands have shown that nitrate aerosol in the form of
ammonium nitrate is a locally important aerosol species in
terms of aerosol mass in the optically active sub-micron size
range and hence the associated radiative forcing. They also
emphasise the problems in measuring the concentrations and
size distributions of nitrate which is a semi-volatile substance.
The contradictory nature of the global studies means that no
“best estimate” or range for the radiative forcing due to anthro-
pogenic nitrate aerosol is presented in this report, though future
studies may prove that it exerts a significant radiative forcing.

"tive index of —0.005i best fits the observations for Saharan dust,
which is in agreement with the values reported by Sokolik er al.
(1993). The refractive indices together with the assumed size
distributions determine the optical parameters. The radiative
forcing is particularly sensitive to the single scattering albedo
(Miller and Tegen, 1999). Additional uncertainties lie in
modelling the size distributions (Tegen and Lacis, 1996;
Claquin et al., 1998) which, together with the refractive indices,
determine the optical parameters. Measurements made by the
Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) by
Ackerman and Chung (1992), showed a local short-wave
radiative perturbation off the west coast of Africa of —40 to
-90 Wm” and a corresponding long-wave perturbation of +5
to +20 Wm” at the top of the atmosphere. Relating instanta-
neous observational measurements that do not account for the
effects of clouds, diurnal averaging of the radiation, the
seasonal signal associated with emissions and the fraction of
mineral dust that is anthropogenic to the global mean radiative
forcing is very difficult. Because the resultant global mean net
radiative forcing is a residual obtained by summing the short-
wave and the long-wave radiative forcings which are of roughly
comparable magnitudes, the uncertainty in the radiative forcing
is large and even the sign is in doubt due to the competing nature
of the short-wave and long-wave effects. The studies above
suggest, on balance, that the shortwave radiative forcing is likely
to be of a larger magnitude than the long-wave radiative forcing,
which indicates that the net radiative forcing is likely to be
negative, although a net positive radiative forcing cannot be
ruled out. Therefore a tentative range of —0.6 to +0.4 Wm is
adopted; a best estimate cannot be assigned as yet.

"Sokolik and Toon (1996) used a simple box model and
neglected forcing in cloudy regions to estimate a short-wave
radiative forcing of —0.25 Wm”? over ocean and -0.6 Wm over
land, leading to a global forcing of approximately —0.46 Wm.
They point out that this is offset to some extent by a positive long-
wave forcing. Tegen and Fung (1995) performed a more detailed
three-dimensional GCM modelling study of dust aerosol and
estimated that approximately 30 to 50% of the total dust burden
is due to changes in land use associated with anthropogenic
activity. The radiative forcing using this data was estimated by
Tegen et al. (1996) to be -0.25 Wm * in the short-wave and +0.34
Wm” in the long-wave, resulting in a net radiative forcing of
+0.09 Wm. Updated calculations of the net radiative forcing
based on Miller and Tegen (1998) estimate the radiative forcing
to be -0.22 Wm in the short-wave and +0.16 Wm? in the long-
wave, resulting in a net radiative forcing of —0.06 Wm. Hansen
et al. (1998) perform similar calculations and calculate a net
radiative forcing of -0.12 Wm by assuming a different vertical
distribution, different optical parameters and using a different
global model. Jacobson (2001) used a multi-component global
aerosol model to estimate the direct radiative forcing to be -0.062
Wm” in the short-wave and +0.05 Wm? in the long-wave,
resulting in a net radiative forcing of —0.012 Wm”. The effects
of non-sphericity of the mineral dust are not accounted for in
these calculations. Mishchenko ef al. (1997) suggest that differ-
ences in the optical parameters between model spheroids and
actual dust particles do not exceed 10 to 15%, although changes
of this magnitude may have a large effect on the radiative forcing
(Miller and Tegen, 1998). An example of the geographical distri-
bution of the radiative forcing is shown in Figure 6.7g (data from
Tegen et al., 1996) which shows regions of positive and negative
forcing. Positive forcing tends to exist over regions of high
surface reflectance and negative radiative forcings tend to exist
over areas of low surface reflectance. This is due to the depend-
ency of the forcing on surface reflectance and the additional
effects of the long-wave radiative forcing.

Here we examine the consistency of the ranges derived in this
section with the ranges obtained using the approach of Chapter 5,
Section 5.4.2. For the industrial sulphate, fossil fuel BC, and fossil
fuel OC aerosols, the “best estimates” of the direct radiative forcing
are -0.4 Wm with a factor of 2 uncertainty, +0.2 Wm with a
factor of 2 uncertainty and -0.1 Wm with a factor of 3
uncertainty, respectively. An estimate of the total direct radiative
forcing from industrial aerosols (using RMS errors) leads to a
range —0.07 to —1.24 Wm which is reasonably consistent with
-0.1 to -1.0 Wm (one standard deviation) from Chapter 5,
Section 5.4.2. For biomass burning aerosols the “best estimate” of
the direct radiative forcing is -0.2 Wm with a range —0.07 to -0.6
Wm”, which is reasonably consistent with -0.1 to -0.5 Wm? (one
standard deviation) obtained from Section 5.4.2.

"variability imply a strong requirement for global observational
data. Until a reliable global observational method for verifying the
radiative effects of anthropogenic aerosols is available, it is likely
that the radiative forcing of any aerosol species will remain difficult
to quantify. Although satellite retrievals of aerosol optical proper-
ties have advanced substantially since the SAR, the difficult
problem of separating anthropogenic from natural aerosol still
remains (Chapter 5). Nevertheless, new analyses reiterate that
global satellite measurements contain tropospheric aerosol
signatures that include those due to anthropogenic aerosols
(Haywood et al., 1999; Boucher and Tanré, 2000). While the
general spatial distribution of the radiative forcing for sulphate
aerosol appears to be similar among the studies listed in Table 6.4,
some important features, such as the seasonal cycle in the radiative
forcing, remain highly uncertain which may have important
consequences in terms of the detection and attribution of climate
change (Chapter 12).

Additionally, while this section has concentrated upon the
radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere, the effects of anthro-
pogenic aerosols upon the radiative budget at the surface of the
Earth has not been considered in detail. For purely scattering
aerosols in cloud-free conditions, the radiative effect at the surface
is within a few per cent of that at the top of the atmosphere (e.g.,
Haywood and Shine, 1997). However, for partially absorbing
aerosols, the radiative effect at the surface may be many times that
at the top of the atmosphere, as evidenced by modelling and
measurement studies (e.g., Haywood and Shine, 1997; Haywood et
al., 1999; Chapter 5). This is because, for partially absorbing
aerosols, energy is transferred directly to the atmospheric column.
Ackerman et al. (2000) point out that this can warm the
atmosphere and “burn off” clouds. They conclude that during the
northeast monsoon (dry season over India) daytime trade cumulus
cloud cover over the northern Indian Ocean can be reduced by
nearly half, although these results depend strongly upon the
meteorological conditions and modelling assumptions. This
process may also be important over the global domain as indicated
by Hansen ef al. (1997a), as the climate sensitivity parameter
(Section 6.2) may differ significantly for absorbing aerosols due to
diabatic heating in the aerosol layer modifying the temperature
structure of the atmosphere, which affects the formation of clouds.
The vertical partitioning of the forcing by absorbing aerosols is
also a potentially important factor in determining climatic changes
at the surface (e.g., evaporation, soil moisture).

"While the radiative forcing due to greenhouse gases may be
determined to a reasonably high degree of accuracy (Section 6.3),
the uncertainties relating to aerosol radiative forcings remain large,
and rely to a large extent on the estimates from global modelling
studies that are difficult to verify at the present time. The range of
estimates presented in this section represents mainly the structural
uncertainties (i.e., differences in the model structures and assump-
tions) rather than the parametric uncertainties (i.e., the uncertainties
in the key parameters) (see Pan et al., 1997). This is because many
of the model calculations for sulphate aerosol use identical size
distributions and refractive indices which lead to identical optical
parameters. Thus the model results are not necessarily
independent, and certainly do not include the full range of
parametric uncertainties. The response of the direct radiative
forcing to parametric uncertainties is investigated in sensitivity
studies for different aerosol species (e.g., Boucher and Anderson,
1995; Haywood and Ramaswamy, 1998). Three major areas of
uncertainty exist; uncertainties in the atmospheric burden and the
anthropogenic contribution to it, uncertainties in the optical
parameters, and uncertainties in implementation of the optical
parameters and burden to give a radiative forcing. The atmospheric
burden of an anthropogenic aerosol species is determined by
factors such as emission, aging, convective transport, scavenging
and deposition processes, each of which have an associated
uncertainty (see Chapter 5). The optical parameters have uncertain-
ties associated with uncertainties in size distribution, chemical
composition, state of mixing, method of mixing, and asphericity.
The problem of the degree of external/internal mixing in the
atmosphere deserves highlighting, as global modelling studies tend
to assume external mixtures which make modelling the sources,
atmospheric transport and radiative properties simpler (e.g., Tegen
et al., 1997). However, single particle analysis of particles
containing mineral dust (e.g., Levin et al., 1996) and sea salt
(Murphy et al., 1998) have often shown them to be internally
mixed with sulphate and other aerosols of anthropogenic origin.
Thus, heterogeneous conversion of SO, to sulphate aerosol on dust
or sea salt particles may effectively lead to sulphate becoming
internally mixed with larger super-micron particles (e.g., Dentener
etal., 1996) leading to a reduction in extinction efficiency, an effect
that has not yet been accounted for in global modelling studies.
Studies that model internal mixtures of absorbing and scattering
aerosols necessarily apply simplifying assumptions such as volume
weighting the refractive indices (e.g., Haywood et al., 1997a;
Myhre et al., 1998c) which may overestimate the degree of absorp-
tion (e.g., Jacobson, 2000). Modelling studies that examine the
effects of internal mixing of multi-component aerosols are only
just becoming available (Jacobson, 2001). Uncertainties in
calculating the radiative forcing from specified burdens and optical
parameters arise from uncertainties in the parametrization of
relative humidity effects, the horizontal and vertical distributions of
the aerosol, the uncertainties and sub-grid scale effects in other
model fields such as clouds, humidity, temperature and surface
reflectance, the representation of the diurnal cycle, and the
accuracy of the radiation code used in the calculations. The short
atmospheric lifetime of aerosols and the resultant large spatial

"The various GCM studies show some disagreement on the
spatial distribution of the forcing, an example of which is shown
in Figure 6.7h. The Northern to Southern Hemisphere ratio varies
from 1.4 to 4 depending on the models. It is generally smaller
than the Northern to Southern Hemisphere ratio of anthropogenic
sulphate aerosol concentrations because of the higher suscepti-
bility of the clouds in the Southern Hemisphere (Platnick and
Twomey, 1994; Taylor and McHaffie, 1994). The ocean to land
ratio depends very much on the method used to relate the
concentration of sulphate mass to the cloud droplet number
concentration and on the natural background aerosol concentra-
tions. It was generally found to be smaller than unity (Boucher
and Lohmann, 1995; Jones and Slingo, 1997; Kiehl et al., 2000).
Larger ratios, such as 1.6 (Chuang ef al., 1997) and 5 (Jones and
Slingo, 1997), are reported in some of the sensitivity experi-
ments. Using a detailed inventory of ship sulphur emissions and
a simple calculation of the aerosol indirect effect, Capaldo ef al.
(1999) suggested that a significant fraction of the effect over the
oceans (—0.11 Wm”, averaged globally) could be due to ship-
emitted particulate matter (sulphate plus organic material). So far

this source of aerosols has not been included in the GCM studies.

"Whereas the first indirect effect can be computed diagnostically,
assessment of the second indirect effect implies that two
independent (i.e., with the same fixed sea surface temperatures,
but with different meteorologies) GCM simulations be made, a
first one with pre-industrial and a second one with present day
aerosols. The difference in top of the atmosphere fluxes or cloud
radiative forcings between two such simulations is used as a
proxy for the forcings due to the second indirect and the
combined effects. The simulations need to be sufficiently long
(usually 5 years) so that the effects of natural variability are
expected to average out. However, as a consequence, the
estimates of the aerosol indirect effect may include some undesir-
able feedbacks involving climate parameters which would violate
the definition adopted for radiative forcing of climate change by
IPCC (see also Section 6.1.1). Rotstayn and Penner (2001)
showed that, at least in their model, the difference in top of the
atmosphere fluxes between two simulations did not differ by
more than 10% from the radiative forcing for the first indirect
effect computed diagnostically. Caution should nevertheless be
exercised before this result can be generalised to other models
and to the second indirect effect.

"Aerosols serve as cloud condensation and ice nuclei, thereby
modifying the microphysics, the radiative properties, and the
lifetime of clouds. The physics and chemistry of the indirect
effect of aerosols is discussed in detail in Chapter 5. Only
aspects directly relevant to quantifying the indirect radiative
forcing by aerosols are presented here. The aerosol indirect
effect is usually split into two effects: the first indirect effect,
whereby an increase in aerosols causes an increase in droplet
concentration and a decrease in droplet size for fixed liquid
water content (Twomey, 1974), and the second indirect effect,
whereby the reduction in cloud droplet size affects the precip-
itation efficiency, tending to increase the liquid water content,
the cloud lifetime (Albrecht, 1989), and the cloud thickness
(Pincus and Baker, 1994). Until recently, the first indirect
effect has received much more attention than the second. IPCC
(1994) and the SAR only considered the first indirect effect.
Shine er al. (1996) retained a range of radiative forcing from 0
to -1.5 Wm” with no best estimate, although a value of —0.8
Wm” was used for the year 1990 in the IS92a scenario
(Kattenberg et al., 1996). Here we review and discuss the
various estimates for the globally averaged aerosol indirect
forcing available in the literature. Because of the inherent
complexity of the aerosol indirect effect, GCM studies dealing
with its quantification necessarily include an important level of
simplification. While this represents a legitimate approach, it
should be clear that the GCM estimates of the aerosol indirect
effect are very uncertain. Section 6.8.2 investigates the indirect
radiative forcing due to sulphate aerosols, on which most
efforts have concentrated, while other aerosol types are treated
in Section 6.8.3. Section 6.8.4 is devoted to alternative
approaches, while Section 6.8.6 describes the aerosol indirect
effects on ice clouds.

Kaufman and Nakajima (1993) used AVHRR ‘data to analyse
bright warm clouds over Brazil during the biomass burning season.
They found a decrease in the cloud reflectance when the smoke
optical thickness increased. Kaufman and Fraser (1997) used a
similar approach to observe thinner and less reflective clouds. They
showed that smoke from biomass burning aerosols reduced the
cloud droplet size and increased the cloud reflectance for smoke
optical depth up to 0.8. They estimated the indirect radiative
forcing by smoke to be -2 Wm over this region for the three
months when biomass burning takes place, which would suggest a
much smaller global average. However, using a combination of
satellite observations and a global chemistry model, Remer ef al.
(1999) estimated that 50% of the cumulative biomass burning
aerosol indirect forcing occurs for smoke optical depth smaller
than 0.1, that is well away from the source regions.

"Some authors have argued that sea salt particles may compete with
sulphate aerosols as cloud condensation nuclei, thereby reducing
the importance of anthropogenic sulphate in droplet nucleation
(Ghan et al., 1998; O’Dowd et al., 1999). While this process is
empirically accounted for in some of the above mentioned
estimates (e.g., Jones et al., 1999), it certainly adds further
uncertainty to the estimates. Considerable sensitivity is found to
the parametrization of the autoconversion process (Boucher et al.,
1995; Lohmann and Feichter, 1997; Delobbe and Gallée, 1998;
Jones et al., 1999) which complicates matters because there is a
need to “tune” the autoconversion onset in GCMs (Boucher et al.,
1995; Fowler et al., 1996; Rotstayn, 1999, 2000) to which the
indirect aerosol forcing is sensitive (Jones et al., 1999; Rotstayn,

sensitive to the treatment of the pre-industrial aerosol concentration

(Ghan et al., 2001a), and the ability of GCMs to simulate the
stratocumulus cloud fields. Finally, it should be noted that all the
studies discussed above cannot be considered as truly
“independent” because many of them (with the exceptions of
Lohmann et al. (2000) and Ghan et al. (2001a)) use similar
methodologies and similar relationships between sulphate mass
and cloud droplet number concentration. Therefore it is suspected
that the range of model results does not encompass the total range
of uncertainties. In an overall sense, it can be concluded that the
considerable sensitivities to the treatment of microphysical details
associated with aerosol-cloud interactions, and their linkages with
macroscopic cloud and circulation parameters, remain to be
thoroughly explored.

"In this section, carbonaceous aerosols refer to the mixture (internal
or external) of OC and BC aerosols. Carbonaceous aerosols (and in
particular biomass burning aerosols) are efficient cloud condensa-
tion nuclei (see Chapter 5 and e.g., Novakov and Penner, 1993;
Novakov and Corrigan, 1996). There have been few GCM studies
estimating the indirect forcing from carbonaceous aerosols. Penner
et al. (1996) reported a range of forcing from —2.5 to -4.5 Wm
(not included in Table 6.6), which is probably an overestimate
because of neglect of other aerosol types such as dust and sea salt
and underestimated natural emissions of organic aerosols. In a new
set of simulations using an updated model accounting for dust and
sea salt aerosols, Chuang et al. (2000b) obtained a forcing of -1.51
Wm for the first indirect effect from carbonaceous aerosols
(0.52 and -1.16 Wm for fossil fuel and biomass burning
aerosols, respectively). This estimate includes the effect of black
carbon absorption in cloud droplets. Lohmann ef al. (2000)
predicted a radiative impact for the combined effect (i.e., first and
second effects) of -1.3 and -0.9 Wm for externally and internally
mixed carbonaceous aerosols, respectively. These estimates do not
include the effects of secondary organic aerosols, nor the effects of
absorption of solar radiation by black carbon within the cloud.

"Jones et al. (1999) and Rotstayn (1999) provide estimates for

effect (first and second effects estimated together), Jones ef al.
(1999) and Rotstayn (1999) give best estimates of —1.18 and —2.1
Wm”. Larger radiative impacts are found in sensitivity tests by
Rotstayn (1999) and Lohmann and Feichter (1997), with values of
-3.2 and -4.8 Wm”, respectively. Rotstayn (1999) tried an
alternative parametrization for cloud droplet concentration
(Roelofs et al., 1998) and Lohmann and Feichter (1997) tried an
alternative cloud scheme. In contrast to these studies, Lohmann et
al. (2000) adopted a “mechanistic” approach, where they
introduced a prognostic equation for the cloud droplet number
concentration. They predict a much smaller combined effect with
radiative impact of 0.0 and -0.4 Wm, assuming externally and
internally mixed sulphate aerosols, respectively. The authors
attribute this rather small radiative impact to the small increase in
anthropogenic sulphate aerosol number concentrations. Ghan et
al. (2001a) estimate a combined effect of —1.7 Wm~ using a
mechanistic approach similar to that of Lohmann et al., but with
aerosol size distribution predicted rather than prescribed. The
larger forcing is due to the absence of lower bounds on droplet and
aerosol number concentrations in the simulations by Ghan et al.
(2001a). Studies by Rotstayn (1999) and Jones et al. (1999) both
indicate that the positive long-wave forcing associated with the
indirect aerosol effect is small (between 0.0 and 0.1 Wm for
each of the effects).

"6.8.3.2 Combination of sulphate and carbonaceous aerosols

Lohmann et al. (2000) found that the radiative impact of sulphate
and carbonaceous aerosols considered simultaneously (—1.5 and

respectively) is comparable to the sum of the radiative impacts
calculated separately (see Table 6.6). Chuang et al. (2000b)
reached a similar conclusion in their experiments where they
considered only the first indirect effect, with a total radiative
forcing of —1.85 Wm”. It is noteworthy, however, that in these
two studies, the predicted radiative forcings for sulphate aerosols
are on the low side. This indicates that it is not wise to add the
radiative forcings due to sulphate and carbonaceous aerosols
obtained separately from two different models. In fact, most of the
GCM studies of the indirect aerosol effect used sulphate as a
surrogate for the total anthropogenic fraction of the aerosol (e.g.,
Boucher and Lohmann, 1995; Feichter et al., 1997; Lohmann and
Feichter, 1997). In this case the computed forcings incorporate the
effects of other aerosol types which have a similar spatial distri-

however, the effects of biomass burning aerosols which have a

different spatial distribution from sulphate aerosols.

Another issue is the potential for light-absorbing aerosols to
increase in-cloud absorption of solar radiation — and correspond-
ingly decrease the cloud albedo — when incorporated inside cloud
droplets. Twohy et al. (1989) concluded from measurements off
the coast of California and from simple radiative calculations that
the observed levels of soot would not lead to a significant impact
on the cloud albedo. Chylek et al. (1996a) estimated an upper
bound for increased absorption of solar radiation of 1 to 3 Wm?
(global and annual average) for a black carbon concentration of
0.5 ugm™>. Considering the modelled atmospheric concentrations
of soot (Chapter 5 and Sections 6.7.3 and 6.7.5) and the fact that
only a fraction of the soot is incorporated in the cloud droplets, the
effect is probably smaller by one to two orders of magnitude.
Heintzenberg and Wendisch (1996) showed that the decrease in
radiative forcing due to a decrease in soot concentrations with
increasing distances from the pollution sources could be compen-
sated by a concurrent increase in the fraction of soot which is
incorporated in the cloud droplets. Only one GCM study to date
has considered the in-cloud absorption of soot. Chuang et al.

using an effective medium approximation. More studies are

that due to greenhouse gases, solar constant, O3, and aerosol
direct effect. Hansen et al. (1995) used a simplified GCM to

cycle of surface air temperature and compared them with
observations. They found that, although the aerosol direct effect

damp the surface temperature diurnal cycle, only an increase in
continental cloud cover would be consistent with observations
(Karl et al., 1993). The required cloud increase depends on cloud
height and would be of the order of 1% global coverage for low
clouds (i.e., 2 to 5% over land). We cannot rule out that such a
change is an unidentified cloud feedback rather than a forcing.
Hansen et al. (1997b) also argued that agreement between
observed and computed temperature trends requires the presence
of another forcing of at least -1 Wm which is inferred as being
due to the indirect effect. In their calculations, the direct tropo-
spheric aerosol effect does not play a large net role, because the
moderately absorbing aerosol assumption leads to an offset
between its sunlight reflecting and absorbing properties insofar
as the top of the atmosphere irradiance change is concerned.
However, this method assumes that the observed change in
temperature since pre-industrial times is primarily a response to
anthropogenic forcings, that all the other anthropogenic forcings
are well quantified, and that the climate sensitivity parameter
(Section 6.1) predicted by the GCM is correct (Rodhe et al.,
2000). Therefore it may simply be a coincidence that the estimate
of Hansen et al. (1997b) is consistent with the GCM estimates
discussed above.

level clouds and a negative sign for the associated radiative
forcing, but these studies do not give indications on what a
(negative) upper bound of the forcing would be. GCM studies
predict radiative forcing for the first indirect effect of industrial
aerosols in the range of -0.3 to -1.8 Wm. However, because of
the uncertainties in the estimates discussed above, the limited
validation of GCM parametrizations and results, and because in-
cloud absorption by black carbon aerosols was not considered in
all but one of the GCM studies, we retain 0 Wm~ as an upper
bound for the first aerosol indirect effect. A lower bound of —2
Wm is selected on the basis of available GCM studies for the
first indirect effect. Not too much emphasis should be given to the

its destruction (Solomon ef al., 1996) have diminished. One
consequence of the aerosol-induced ozone depletion may have
been a prolonged cooling of the lower stratosphere to abnormally

"The fundamental source of all energy in the climate system is
the Sun so that variation in solar output provides a means for
radiative forcing of climate change. It is only since the late
1970s, however, and the advent of space-borne measurements
of total solar irradiance (TSI), that it has been clear that the
solar “constant” does, in fact, vary. These satellite instruments
suggest a variation in annual mean TSI of the order 0.08% (or
about 1.1 Wm?) between minimum and maximum of the 11-
year solar cycle. While the instruments are capable of such
precision their absolute calibration is much poorer such that, for
example, TSI values for solar minimum 1986 to 1987 from the
ERB radiometer on Nimbus 7 and the ERBE experiment on
NOAA-9 disagree by about 7 Wm (Lean and Rind, 1998).
More recent data from ACRIM on UARS, EURECA and VIRGO
on SOHO cluster around the ERBE value (see Figure 6.4) so
absolute uncertainty may be estimated at around 4 Wm.
Although individual instrument records last for a number of
years, each sensor suffers degradation on orbit so that construc-
tion of a composite series of TSI from overlapping records
becomes a complex task. Figure 6.4 shows TSI measurements

cause. Hansen ef al. (1997b) estimate that a forcing of -0.4 Wm?
has resulted, about half of which is estimated to have occurred in
the Industrial Era. The largest effect is estimated to be at the high
latitudes where snow-covered forests that have a lower albedo
have been replaced by snow-covered deforested areas. Hansen et
al. (1998) point out that the albedo of a cultivated field is affected
more by a given snowfall than the albedo of an evergreen forest.
They performed a simulation with pre-industrial vegetation
replaced by current land-use patterns and found the global mean
forcing to be -0.21 Wm, with the largest contributions coming
from deforested areas in Eurasia and North America. In a similar
study, Betts (2001) estimates an instantaneous radiative forcing of
—0.20 Wm by surface albedo change due to present day land use
relative to natural vegetation. In agreement with Hansen et al.
(1997b), the greatest effect is seen in the high latitude agricultural
regions. If, as above, half of the land clearance is assumed to have
taken place since the industrial revolution, this suggests a forcing
of -0.10 Wm by land use over this period. In a parallel simula-
tion with the climate free to respond to the change in albedo and
other vegetation characteristics, lower temperatures are simulated
in the northern mid-latitudes. These are mainly attributed to the
increased surface albedo, although increases in cloud cover cause
further localised reductions in the net surface short-wave radiation
in some regions. However, some areas exhibit higher temperatures
in their dry season, consistent with a decrease in evapotranspira-
tion due to reduced access of soil moisture by the shallower roots

A more fundamental approach recognises that solar radiative
output is determined by a balance between increases due to the
development of faculae and decreases due to the presence of
sunspots. Longer-term changes are also speculated to be occurring
in the quiet Sun against which these variable active regions are set.
The sunspot darkening depends on the area of the solar disc
covered by the sunspots while the facular brightening has been
related to a variety of indices. These include sunspot number
(Lean et al., 1995), emission of singly ionised calcium (Ca II at
393.4 nm) (Lean et al., 1992), solar cycle length, solar cycle decay
rate, solar rotation rate and various empirical combinations of all
of these (Hoyt and Schatten, 1993; Solanki and Fligge, 1998).

In addition to estimates of the impact of active regions on in TSI

potential contributions due to the variation in brightness of the
quiet Sun have been estimated (Lean et al., 1992; White er al.,
1992). These were largely based on observations of the behaviour
of Sun-like stars (Baliunas and Jastrow, 1990) and the assumption
that during the Maunder Minimum (an extended period during the
late 17th century during which no sunspots were observed) the
Sun was in a non-cycling state. The various reconstructions vary
widely in the values deduced for TSI during the Maunder
Minimum relative to the present. Mendoza (1997) has pointed out
that uncertainties in the assumptions made about the state of the
Sun during that period could imply a range of between 1 and 15
Wm”? reduction in TSI less than present mean values although
most estimates lie in the 3 to 5.5 Wm” range. Figure 6.5 shows
group sunspot numbers from 1610 to 1996 (Hoyt and Schatten,
1998) together with five TSI reconstructions. The sunspot
numbers (grey curve, scaled to correspond to Nimbus-7 TSI
observations for 1979 to 1993) show little long-term trend. Lean
et al. (1995, solid red curve) determine long-term variability from
sunspot cycle amplitude; Hoyt and Schatten (1993, black solid
curve) use mainly the length of the sunspot cycle; the two Solanki
and Fligge (1998) blue curves (dotted) are similar in derivation to
the Lean et al. and Hoyt and Schatten methods. Lockwood and
Stamper (1999, heavy dash-dot green curve) use an entirely
different approach, based not on sunspot numbers but on the aa
geomagnetic index, and predict somewhat larger variation over
individual cycles but less on the longer term. Clearly, even
disregarding the shifts due to absolute scaling, there are large
differences between the TSI reconstructions. Thus knowledge of
solar radiative forcing is uncertain, even over the 20th century and
certainly over longer periods.

response. This mode, also seen in response to heating in the lower
stratosphere caused by injection of volcanic aerosol, shows dipole
anomalies in zonal wind structure which propagate down, over the
winter period, into the troposphere. Rind and Balachandran
(1995) investigated the impact of large increases in solar ultra-
violet on the troposphere with a GCM and confirmed that altered
refraction characteristics affect wave propagation in winter high
latitudes. Solar cycle changes to wave propagation in the middle
atmosphere were also investigated by Arnold and Robinson
(1998) who used a three-dimensional model of the atmosphere
between 10 and 140 km to study the effects of thermospheric
heating. They found that non-linear interactions in the winter
hemisphere resulted in changes to the stratospheric circulation. It
is not clear that the signals discussed above are statistically robust
in any of these studies.

"Variations in stratospheric composition and thermal structure
resulting from ultraviolet irradiance changes may have an impact
on tropospheric climate. The first mechanism whereby this might
happen is through changes in radiative forcing (Haigh, 1994).
Thus, in addition to a direct increase in downward short-wave
irradiance at the tropopause, higher solar activity can cause an
increase in downward infrared flux by heating the stratosphere
and also radiative forcing due to O; changes. However, the sign of
the O; effect is not well established. Haigh (1994) found that O;
increases reduced the solar radiative forcing by about 0.1 Wm-?
at solar maximum, Wuebbles er al. (1998) computed a value of
—0.13 Wm? due to O3 increases since the Maunder Minimum and
Myhre et al. (1998a) about —0.02 Wm from minimum to
maximum of the solar cycle. Hansen et al. (1997a) showed an
additional forcing of about +0.05 Wm from minimum to
maximum of a solar cycle due to O3 increases and lower strato-
spheric warming. Haigh (1999) and Larkin er al. (2000) suggest
that the O; effect has little effect on radiative forcing at the
tropopause but significant effect on where the additional radiation
is absorbed (more within the troposphere rather than at the
surface). These disparities may represent the different approaches
used. Haigh (1994), Wuebbles er al. (1998), and Myhre et al.
(1998a) calculated the O; response using two-dimensional
chemical-transport models in which temperature changes are
estimated using the fixed dynamic heating approximation. The
Hansen et al. (1997a) value was deduced from studies with a
simplified GCM of sensitivity to slab O3; changes (of unspecified
cause) and the assumption that the solar-induced O; change is all
within the 10 to 150 hPa region. Haigh (1999) and Larkin et al.
(2000) specified solar irradiance and O3 changes and calculated
the stratospheric temperature response in GCMs. The negative
radiative forcing values probably correspond to O; change profiles
which peak at higher altitudes, and thus have less impact on lower
stratospheric temperature and long-wave radiative forcing,
although the different methods for calculating temperature change
may also be important.

A further consideration must be potential physical
mechanisms whereby cosmic rays might enhance cloudiness.
Cosmic rays are the principal source of ionisation in the free
troposphere. Furthermore, ionisation rates and atmospheric
conductivity are observed to vary with solar activity. Svensmark
and Friis-Christensen (1997) propose that the correlation between
cosmic rays and cloud cover that they observed is due to an
increase in efficiency of charged particles, over uncharged ones, in
acting as cloud condensation nuclei. There is evidence for this
occurring in thunderstorms (Pruppacher and Klett, 1997) but it is
not clear to what extent this affects cloud development. There is
also evidence that ions are sometimes critical in gas-to-particle
conversion but again there is no evidence that this has any impact
on cloud formation.

"Svensmark (1998) showed that, at least for the limited period
of this study, total cloud varies more closely with GCRs than with
the 10.7 cm solar activity index over the past solar cycle. On
longer time-scales he also demonstrated that Northern
Hemisphere surface temperatures between 1937 and 1994 follow
variations in cosmic ray flux and solar cycle length more closely
than total irradiance or sunspot number. There has been a long-
term decrease in cosmic ray flux since the late 17th century, as
evidenced by the !Be and 'C cosmogenic isotope records
(Stuiver and Reimer, 1993; Beer et al., 1994), and this mirrors the
long-term increase in TSI. However, the TSI reconstruction of
Hoyt and Schatten (1993), which is based on solar cycle lengths,
does not appear to track the cosmogenic isotope records any more
closely than that of Lean et al. (1995), which is based on sunspot
cycle amplitude (Lean and Rind, 1998). Such use of different solar
indices may help to identify which physical mechanisms, if any,
are responsible for the apparent meteorological responses to solar

"In a series of papers, Brian Tinsley has developed a more
detailed mechanism for a link between cosmic rays and cloudiness
(e.g., Tinsley, 1996). This is based on the premise that aerosols
ionised by cosmic rays are more effective as ice nuclei and cause
freezing of supercooled water in clouds. In clouds that are likely
to cause precipitation the latent heat thus released then causes
enhanced convection which promotes cyclonic development and
hence increased storminess. There is some laboratory evidence to
suggest that charging increases ice nucleation efficiency
(Pruppacher, 1973) although there is no observational evidence of
this process taking place in the atmosphere. Furthermore, only a
small proportion of aerosol particles are capable of acting as ice
nuclei, depending on chemical composition or shape. There are
also laboratory studies (Abbas and Latham, 1969) which indicate
the existence of “electrofreezing”, but again no evidence in the
real atmosphere. Thus Tinsley’s mechanism is plausible but
requires further observational and modelling studies to establish
whether or not it could be of sufficient magnitude to result in the
claimed effects (Harrison and Shine, 1999).

Svensmark and Friis-Christensen (1997) demonstrated a high
degree of correlation between total cloud cover, from the ISCCP
C2 data set, and cosmic ray flux between 1984 and 1991. Changes
in the heliosphere arising from fluctuations in the Sun’s magnetic
field mean that galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) are less able to reach
the Earth when the Sun is more active so the cosmic ray flux is
inversely related to solar activity. Svensmark and Friis-
Christensen analysed monthly mean data of total cloud using only
data over the oceans between 60°S and 60°N from geostationary
satellites. They found an increase in cloudiness of 3 to 4% from
solar maximum to minimum and speculated that (a) increased
GCR flux causes an increase in total cloud and that (b) the
increase in total cloud causes a cooling of climate. Svensmark and
Friis-Christensen (1997) also extended this analysis to cover the
years 1980 to 1996 using cloud data from the DMSP and Nimbus-
7 satellites and showed that the high correlation with GCR flux is
maintained. However, it was not possible to intercalibrate the
different data sets so the validity of the extended data set as a
measure of variations in absolute total cloudiness is open to

question.

that the pattern of change in cloudiness over that period, particu-
larly in the Pacific Ocean, corresponds to what would be expected
for the atmospheric circulation changes characteristic of El Nifio.
Kernthaler et al. (1999) have also studied the ISCCP dataset, using
both geostationary and polar orbiter data and suggested that the
correlation with cosmic ray flux is reduced if high latitude data are
included. This would not be expected if cosmic rays were directly
inducing increases in cloudiness, as cosmic ray flux is greatest at
high latitudes. Kernthaler et al. (1999), Jorgensen and Hansen
(2000), and Gierens and Ponater (1999), also noted that a
mechanism whereby cosmic rays resulted in greater cloud cover
would be most likely to affect high cloud as ionisation is greatest
at these altitudes. Even if high cloud did respond to cosmic rays,
it is not clear that this would cause global cooling as for thin high
cloud the long-wave warming effects dominate the short-wave
cooling effect. Kristjansson and Kristiansen (2000) have addition-
ally analysed the ISCCP D2 dataset, 1989 to 1993, and found little
statistical evidence of a relationship between GCRs and cloud
cover with the possible exception of low marine clouds in mid-
latitudes. They also noted that there was no correlation between
outgoing long-wave radiation, as represented in ERBE data, and
GCRs. Thus the evidence for a cosmic ray impact on cloudiness
remains unproven.

The impact of greenhouse gas emissions upon the
atmosphere is related not only to radiative properties, but also
to the time-scale characterising the removal of the substance
from the atmosphere. Radiative properties control the absorp-
tion of radiation per kilogram of gas present at any instant, but
the lifetime (or adjustment time, see Chapter 4) controls how
long an emitted kilogram is retained in the atmosphere and
hence is able to influence the thermal budget. The climate
system responds to changes in the thermal budget on time-
scales ranging from the order of months to millennia
depending upon processes within the atmosphere, ocean,
cryosphere, etc.

"Just as radiative forcing provides a simplified means of
comparing the various factors that are believed to influence the
climate system to one another, Global Warming Potentials
(GWPs) are one type of simplified index based upon radiative
properties that can be used to estimate the potential future
impacts of emissions of different gases upon the climate
system in a relative sense. The formulation of GWPs, reasons
for the choice of various time horizons, and the effects of
clouds, scenarios, and many other factors upon GWP values
were discussed in detail in IPCC (1994). That discussion will
not be repeated here. Section 6.2 discusses the relationship
between radiative forcing and climate response and describes
recent studies that have supported the view that many different
kinds of forcing agents (e.g., various greenhouse gases,
sulphate aerosols, solar activity, etc.) yield similar globally
averaged climate responses per Wm of forcing (albeit with
different spatial patterns in some important cases). These
parallels in global mean climate responses have motivated the
use of simplified measures to estimate in an approximate
fashion the relative effects of emissions of different gases on
climate. The emphasis on relative rather than absolute effects
(such as computed temperature change) avoids dependence
upon any particular model of climate response.

"where TH is the time horizon over which the calculation is
considered, ax is the radiative efficiency due to a unit increase
in atmospheric abundance of the substance in question (i.e.,
Wm kg~!), [x(t)] is the time-dependent decay in abundance of
the instantaneous release of the substance, and the corresponding
quantities for the reference gas are in the denominator. The GWP
of any substance therefore expresses the integrated forcing of a
pulse (of given small mass) of that substance relative to the
integrated forcing of a pulse (of the same mass) of the reference
gas over some time horizon. The numerator of Equation 6.2 is the
absolute (rather than relative) GWP of a given substance, referred
to as the AGWP. The GWPs of various greenhouse gases can then
be easily compared to determine which will cause the greatest
integrated radiative forcing over the time horizon of interest. The
direct relative radiative forcings per ppbv are derived from
infrared radiative transfer models based on laboratory measure-
ments of the molecular properties of each substance and consid-
ering the molecular weights. Updated information since the SAR
is presented for many gases in Section 6.3. Many important
changes in these quantities were recently reviewed in WMO
(1999) and will be briefly summarised here. In addition, some
gases can indirectly affect radiative forcing, mainly through
chemical processes. For example, tropospheric O3 provides a
significant radiative forcing of the climate system, but its produc-
tion occurs indirectly, as a result of atmospheric chemistry
following emissions of precursors such as NO,, CO, and
NMHCs (see Section 6.6 and Chapter 4). Indirect effects will be

The radiative efficiency per kilogram of CO, has been
updated compared to previous IPCC assessments (IPCC, 1994;
SAR). Here we employ the approach discussed in WMO (1999)
using the simplified formula presented in Table 6.2. We assume
a background CO, mixing ratio of 364 ppmy, close to the present
day value (WMO (1995) used 354 ppmv). For this assumption,
this expression agrees well with the adjusted total-sky radiative
forcing calculations of Myhre and Stordal (1997); see also
Myhre et al. (1998b). The revised forcing is about 12% lower
than that in the SAR. For a small perturbation in CO, from 364
ppmy, the radiative efficiency is 0.01548 Wm~ ppmv~!. This
value is used in the GWP calculations presented here. We
emphasise that it applies only to GWP calculations and cannot
be used to obtain the total radiative forcing for this key gas since
pre-industrial times, due to time-dependent changes in mixing
ratio as noted above. Because of this change in the CO) forcing
per mass, the CO, AGWPs are 0.207, 0.696, and 2.241 Wm/yr
/ppmv~! for 20, 100, and 500 year time horizons, respectively.
These are smaller than the values used in the SAR by 13%.
AGWPs for any gas can be obtained from the GWP values given

The lifetimes of non-CO, greenhouse gases are dependent
largely on atmospheric photochemistry, which controls photo-
lysis and related removal processes as discussed in Chapter 4.
When the lifetime of the gas in question is comparable to the
response time of CO, (nominally about 150 years, although it is
clear that the removal of CO, cannot be adequately described
by a single, simple exponential lifetime; see IPCC (1994) and
the discussion below), the GWP is relatively insensitive to
choice of time horizon, i.e., for N,O. When the lifetime of the
gas in question differs substantially from the response time of
the reference gas, the GWP becomes sensitive to the choice of
time horizon, which in turn implies a decision regarding the
climate processes and impacts of interest, as noted above. For
longer time horizons, those species that decay more rapidly
than the reference gas display decreasing GWPs, with the slope
of the decay being dependent mainly on the lifetime of the gas
in question. Gases with lifetimes much longer than that of the
reference gas (e.g., C)F¢) display increasing GWPs over long
time horizons (i.e., greater than a hundred years). We emphasise
that the GWP is an integral from zero to the chosen time
horizon; hence the values presented in the table for 25, 100, and
500 years are not additive.

calculated sea level rise to good accuracy, that for CH, (a short-
lived gas with a lifetime of about 10 years) represented sea level
rise far better than it did the instantaneous temperature change
for that time horizon. For very short-lived gases, GWPs are
often calculated using a ‘slab’ (continuous) rather than pulse
emission. This approach involves the assumption of specific
scenarios for the magnitudes of the slabs. For some very short-
lived gases such as NMHCs, models must employ ‘slab’
emissions in GWP analyses since their impact depends
critically on non-linear coupled chemical processes. Some
examples are given in Sections 6.12.3.2 and 6.12.3.4.

than a few months); GWPs for such very short-lived gases may
need to be treated with caution, because the gases are unlikely to

"The decreases in the CO; AGWPs will lead to proportion-

horizons of 20, 100, and 500 years. The list includes CHy, N50,
CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs, hydrochlorocarbons, bromocarbons,

from the values given per ppbv in Section 6.3. Several of these
have been updated since the SAR, most notably that of CFC-11.
Since the radiative forcings of the halocarbon replacement gases
are scaled relative to CFC-11 in GWP calculations, the GWPs of
those gases are also affected by this change. As discussed further
in Section 6.3, the change in radiative forcing for CFC-11 reflects
new studies (Pinnock er al., 1995; Christidis er al., 1997; Hansen
et al., 1997a; Myhre and Stordal, 1997; Good et al., 1998)

Uncertainties in the lifetimes of CFC-11 and CH;CCl, are
thought to be about 10%, while uncertainties in the lifetimes of
gases obtained relative to CFC-11 or CH3CCl, are somewhat
larger (20 to 30%) (SAR; WMO, 1999). Uncertainties in the
radiative forcing per unit mass of the majority of the gases
considered in Table 6.7 are approximately + 10%. The SAR
suggested typical uncertainties of + 35% (relative to the reference
gas) for the GWPs, and we retain this uncertainty estimate for
gases listed in Table 6.7. In addition to uncertainties in the CO,
radiative efficiency per kilogram and in the response function,
AGWPs of CO) are affected by assumptions concerning future
CO), abundances as noted above. Furthermore, as the CO) mixing
ratios and climate change, the pulse response function changes as
well. In spite of these dependencies on the choice of future
emission scenarios, it remains likely that the error introduced by
these assumptions is smaller than the uncertainties introduced by
our imperfect understanding of the carbon cycle (see Chapter 3).
Finally, although any induced error in the CO; AGWPs will
certainly affect the non-CO, GWPs, it will not affect intercom-
parisons among non-CO, GWPs.

production is highly dependent on the abundance and distribution
of NO, (PCC, 1994; SAR). Other indirect effects include the
production of stratospheric water vapour (assumed here to

temporal changes in the CH, adjustment time resulting from its

(Prather, 1996) and is subject to similar uncertainty. This term can
be evaluated with reasonable accuracy using a box model, as
shown by Prather (1996) and Daniel and Solomon (1998).
Emissions of CO can also lead to the production of O3 (see
Chapter 4), with the magnitude of O; formation dependent on the
amount of NO, present. As with CHy, this effect is quite difficult
to quantify due to the highly variable and uncertain NO, distri-
bution (e.g., Emmons et al., 1997). Because of the difficulty in
accurately calculating the amount of O3; produced by CO
emissions, an accurate estimate of the entire indirect forcing of
CO requires a three-dimensional chemical model. Table 6.9
presents estimates of the CO GWP due to O; production and to
feedbacks on the CH, cycle from two recent multi-dimensional
model studies (in which a “slab” emission of CO was imposed),

In addition to their direct radiative forcing, chlorinated and
brominated halocarbons can lead to a significant indirect forcing
through their destruction of stratospheric O3 (Section 6.4). By
destroying stratospheric Os, itself a greenhouse gas, halocarbons
induce a negative indirect forcing that counteracts some or
perhaps all (in certain cases) of their direct forcing. Furthermore,
decreases in stratospheric O3 act to increase the ultraviolet field
of the troposphere and hence can increase OH and deplete those
gases destroyed by reaction with the OH radical (particularly
CHy,); this provides an additional negative forcing. Quantifying
the magnitude of the negative indirect forcing is quite difficult for
several reasons. As discussed in Section 6.4, the negative forcing

"arising from the O; destruction is highly dependent on the
altitude profile of the O; loss. The additional radiative effect due
to enhanced tropospheric OH is similarly difficult to quantify
(see e.g., WMO, 1999). While recognising these uncertainties,
estimates have been made of the net radiative forcing due to
particular halocarbons, which can then be used to determine net
GWPs (including both direct and indirect effects). This was done
by Daniel et al. (1995), where it was shown that if the enhanced
tropospheric OH effect were ignored, and the negative forcing
due to O; loss during the 1980s was —0.08 Wm”, the net GWPs
for the bromocarbons were significantly negative, illustrating the
impact of the negative forcing arising from the bromocarbon-
induced ozone depletion. While the effect on the chlorocarbon
GWPs was less pronounced, it was significant as well. Table 6.10
updates the results from Daniel ef al.’s “constant-alpha” case A
as in WMO (1999), where the effectiveness of bromine for O3 loss
relative to chlorine (called alpha) has been increased from 40 to
60. The updated radiative efficiency of CO, has also been

"The short lifetimes and complex non-linear chemistries of NO,

challenging task subject to very large uncertainties (see Chapter
4). However, IPCC (1999) has probed in detail the issue of the
relative differences in the impacts of NO, upon O; depending on
where it is emitted (in particular, surface emissions versus those
from aircraft). Higher altitude emissions have greater impacts
both because of longer NO, residence times and more efficient
tropospheric O; production, as well as enhanced radiative forcing
sensitivity (see Section 6.5). Two recent two-dimensional model
studies (Fuglestvedt et al., 1996; Johnson and Derwent, 1996)
have presented estimates of the GWPs for NO, emitted from
aircraft. These studies suggest GWPs of the order of 450 for
aircraft NO, emissions considering a 100-year time horizon,
while those for surface emissions are likely to be much smaller,
of the order of 5. While such numerical values are subject to very
large quantitative uncertainties, they illustrate that the emissions
of NO, from aircraft are characterised by far greater GWPs than
those of surface sources, due mainly to the longer lifetime of the
emitted NO, at higher altitudes.

1990s; about 2000) (numerical values are also listed in Table 6.11). For detailed explanations see Section 6.13. The height of the rectangular bar
denotes a central or best estimate value while its absence denotes no best estimate is possible. The vertical line about the rectangular bar with “x”
delimiters indicates an estimate of the uncertainty range, guided by the spread in the published values of the forcing and physical understanding. A
vertical line without a rectangular bar and with “o” delimiters denotes a forcing for which no central estimate can be given owing to large
uncertainties. The uncertainty range specified here has no statistical basis and therefore differs from the use of the term elsewhere in this
document. A “level of scientific understanding” (LOSU) index is accorded to each forcing, with H, M, L and VL denoting high, medium, low and
very low levels, respectively. This represents our subjective judgement about the reliability of the forcing estimate, involving factors such as the
assumptions necessary to evaluate the forcing, the degree of our knowledge of the physical/chemical mechanisms determining the forcing, and the
uncertainties surrounding the quantitative estimate of the forcing (see Table 6.12). The well-mixed greenhouse gases are grouped together into a
single rectangular bar with the individual mean contributions due to CO), CHy, N2O, and halocarbons (see Tables 6.1 and 6.11) shown; halocar-
bons refers to all halogen-containing compounds listed in Table 6.1. “FF” denotes fossil fuel burning while “BB” denotes biomass burning
aerosol. Fossil fuel burning is separated into the “black carbon” (be) and “organic carbon” (oc) components with its separate best estimate and
range. The sign of the effects due to mineral dust is itself an uncertainty. The indirect forcing due to tropospheric aerosols is poorly understood.
The same is true for the forcing due to aviation via their effects on contrails and cirrus clouds. Only the first type of indirect effect due to aerosols
as applicable in the context of liquid clouds is considered here. The second type of effect is conceptually important but there exists very little
confidence in the simulated quantitative estimates. The forcing associated with stratospheric aerosols from volcanic eruptions is highly variable
over the period and is not considered for this plot (however, see Figure 6.8d). All the forcings shown have distinct spatial and seasonal features
(Figure 6.7) such that the global, annual means appearing on this plot do not yield a complete picture of the radiative perturbation. They are only
intended to give, in a relative sense, a first-order perspective on a global, annual mean scale, and cannot be readily employed to obtain the climate
response to the total natural and/or anthropogenic forcings. As in the SAR, it is emphasised that the positive and negative global mean forcings
cannot be added up and viewed a priori as providing offsets in terms of the complete global climate impact.

the SAR estimates. In many respects, there is a similarity
between the estimates, range and understanding levels listed here,
and those stated in the recent studies of Hansen et al. (1998) and
Shine and Forster (1999). Table 6.11 compares the numerical
values with the estimates in the SAR. Also, the Northern to

The estimate for stratospheric O; has increased in
magnitude, owing mainly to the inclusion of observed ozone
depletions through mid-1995 and beyond. It is an encouraging
feature that several different model calculations yield similar
estimates for the forcing. The uncertainty range remains similar
to that given in the SAR. These arguments suggest an elevation
of the confidence in the forcing estimate relative to the SAR.
Accordingly, a “medium” LOSU is assigned here. A still higher
elevation of the rank is precluded because the O; loss profile near
tropopause continues to be an uncertainty that is significant and
that has not been adequately resolved. Also, the global strato-
spheric temperature change calculations involved in the forcing
determination are not quantitatively identical to the observed
changes, which in turn, affects, the precision of the forcing
estimate.

Volcanic aerosols that represent a transient forcing of the
climate system following an eruption are not plotted since they are
episodic events and cannot be categorised as a century-scale
secular forcing, unlike the others. However, they can have
substantial impacts on interannual to decadal scale temperature
changes and hence are important factors in the time evolution of
the forcing (see Section 6.15). Some studies (Hansen et al., 1998;
Shine and Forster, 1999) have attempted to scale the volcanic
forcings in a particular decade with respect to that in a quiescent

The estimate for the direct sulphate aerosol forcing has also
seen multiple model investigations since the SAR, resulting in
more estimates being available for this assessment. It is striking
that consideration of all of the estimates available since 1996 lead
to the same best estimate (-0.4 Wm”) and uncertainty (—0.2 to
—0.8 Wm”) range as in the previous assessment. As in the case of
O3, that could be a motivation for elevating the status of
knowledge of this forcing to a higher confidence level. However,
there remain critical areas of uncertainty concerning the
modelling of the geographical distribution of sulphate aerosols,
spatial cloud distributions, effects due to relative humidity etc.
Hence, we retain a “low” LOSU for this forcing.

Mineral dust is a new component in the current assessment.
The studies on the “disturbed” soils suggest an anthropogenic
influence, with a range from +0.4 to -0.6 Wm~. In general, the
evaluation for dust aerosol is complicated by the fact that the
short-wave consists of a significant reflection and absorption
component, and the long-wave also exerts a substantial contribu-
tion by way of a trapping of the infrared radiation. Thus, the net
radiative energy gained or lost by the system is the difference
between non-negligible positive and negative radiative flux
changes operating simultaneously. Because of this complexity,
we refrain from giving a best estimate and accord this component
a “very low” LOSU.

The SAR stated a radiative forcing of +0.1 Wm for fossil
fuel (FF) black carbon aerosols with a range +0.03 to +0.3 Wm,
and a “very low” level of confidence. For biomass burning (BB)
aerosols, the SAR stated a radiative forcing of —0.2 Wm with a
range —0.07 to -0.6 Wm, and a “very low” level of confidence.
In the present assessment, the radiative forcing of the black carbon
component from FF is estimated to be +0.2 Wm with a range
from +0.1 to +0.4 Wm based on studies since the SAR. A “very
low” LOSU is accorded in view of the differences in the estimates
from the various models. The organic carbon component from FF
is estimated to yield a forcing of -0.1 Wm~ with a range from
-0.03 to -0.30 Wm; this has a “very low” LOSU. Note that
extreme caution must be exercised in adding the uncertainties of
the organic and black carbon components to get the uncertainty
for FF as a whole. For BB aerosols, no attempt is made to separate
into black and organic carbon components, in view of consider-
able uncertainties. The central estimate and range for BB aerosols
remains the same as in the SAR; this has a “very low” LOSU in
view of the several uncertainties in the calculations (Section 6.7).

"As explained in Section 6.8, the “indirect” forcing due to all
tropospheric aerosols can be thought of as comprising two
effects. Only the first type of effect as applicable in the context of
liquid clouds is considered here. As in the SAR, no best estimate
is given in view of the large uncertainties prevailing in this
problem (Section 6.8). The range (0 to —-2 Wm) is based on
published estimates and subjective assessment of the uncertain-
ties. Although several model studies suggest a non-zero, negative
value as the upper bound (about —0.3 Wm”), substantial gaps in
the knowledge remain which affect the confidence in the model
simulations of this forcing (e.g., uncertainties in aerosol and
cloud processes and their representations in GCMs, the
potentially incomplete knowledge of the radiative effect of black
carbon in clouds, and the possibility that the forcings for
individual aerosol types may not be additive), such that the
possibility of a very small negative value cannot be excluded;
thus zero is retained as an upper bound as in the SAR. In view of
the large uncertainties in the processes and the quantification, a
“very low” LOSU is assigned to this forcing. Inclusion of the
second indirect effect (Chapter 5) is fraught with even more
uncertainties and, despite being conceptually valid as an anthro-
pogenic perturbation, raises the question of whether the model
estimates to-date can be unambiguously characterised as an
aerosol radiative forcing.

One diagnostic constraint on the total global mean forcing
since pre-industrial times is likely to be provided by comparisons
of model-simulated (driven by the combination of forcings) and
observed climate changes, including spatially-based detection-
attribution analyses (Chapter 12). However, the a posteriori
inference involves a number of crucial assumptions, including the
uncertainties associated with the forcings, the representativeness
of the climate models’ sensitivity to the forcings, and the model’s
representation of the real world’s * “natural” variations.

It is also cautioned that it may y be inappropriate to perform a
sum of the forcings to derive a best estimate “total” radiative
forcing. Such an operation has the limitation that there are
differing degrees of reliability of the global mean estimates of the
various forcings, which do not necessarily lend themselves to a
well-justified quantitative manipulation. For some forcings, there
is not even a central or best estimate given at present (e.g.,
indirect aerosol forcing), essentially due to the substantial

uncertainties.

global mean estimates. No attempt is made here to extend these
subjective characterisations to the spatial domains associated
with each of the forcings (see Figure 6.7, and Table 6.11 for the

reiterate that, in view of the spatial character of several of the
forcing agents, the global mean estimates do not necessarily
describe the complete spatial (horizontal and vertical

radiative perturbation. Nor do they yield quantitative information
about changes in parameters other than the global mean surface

many of them show similar features that are highlighted in this

different studies calculate different magnitudes of the radiative
forcing. In these cases, the spatial distributions are discussed, not
the absolute values of the radiative forcing. It should be stressed

Overall, the net forcing comprises of a large positive value
due to well-mixed greenhouse gases, followed by a number of
other agents that have smaller positive or negative values. Thus,
relative to IPCC (1990) and over this past decade, there are now
more forcing agents to be accounted for, each with a sizeable
uncertainty that can affect the estimated climate response. In this
regard, consideration of the “newer” forcing agents brings on an
additional element of uncertainty in climate change analyses,
over and above those concerning climate feedbacks and natural
variability (IPCC, 1990). Both the spatial character of the forcing
and doubts about the magnitudes (and, in some cases, even the
sign) add to the complexity of the climate change problem.
However, this does not necessarily imply that the uncertainty
associated with the forcings is now of much greater importance
than the issue of climate sensitivity of models.
"	Text
"It is important that the global mean forcing estimates be
interpreted in a proper manner. Recall that the utility of the
forcing concept is to afford a first-order perspective into the
relative climatic impacts (viz., global-mean surface temperature
change) of the different forcings. As stated in Section 6.2, for
many of the relevant forcings (e.g., well-mixed greenhouse gases,
solar, certain aerosol and O; profile cases), model studies suggest
a reasonable similarity of the climate sensitivity factor (Equation
6.1), such that a comparison of these forcings is meaningful for
assessing their relative effects on the global mean surface temper-
ature. However, as mentioned earlier, the climate sensitivity
factor for some of the spatially inhomogeneous forcings has yet
to be fully explored. For some of the forcings (e.g., involving
some absorbing aerosol and O; profile cases; see Hansen et al.,
1997a), the climate sensitivity is markedly different than for, say,
the well-mixed greenhouse gases, while, for other forcings (e.g.,
indirect aerosol effect), more comprehensive studies are needed
before a generalisation can become possible.

"The ranges given for the various forcings in Figure 6.6, as
already pointed out, do not have a statistical basis and are guided
mostly by the estimates from published model studies.
Performing mathematical manipulations using these ranges to
obtain a “net uncertainty range” for the total forcing, therefore,
lacks a rigorous basis. Adding to the complexity is the fact that
each forcing has associated with it an assessment of the level of
knowledge that is subjective in nature viz., LOSU (Table 6.12).
The LOSU index is not a quantitative indicator and, at best, yields
a qualitative sense about the reliability of the estimates, with the
well-mixed greenhouse gases having the highest reliability, those
with “medium” rank having lesser reliability, and with even less
reliability for the “low” and “very low” rankings. To some extent,
the relatively lower ranking of the non-well-mixed greenhouse
gases (e.g., aerosols, O3) is associated with the fact that the
forcing estimates for these agents depend on model simulations
of species’ concentrations, in contrast to the well-mixed
greenhouse gases whose global concentrations are well quanti-
fied.

uncertainties in the modelled mineral aerosol optical properties

aerosols emitted from fossil fuels contain a higher black/organic
carbon ratio than biomass aerosols (Penner ef al., 1998b; Grant et

radiative forcing due to sulphate aerosols reveals that the areas of

degree by the radiative forcing due to fossil fuel emissions of

An example of the direct ‘radiative forcing due to organic

6.7e (Penner et al., 1998b; Grant et al., 1999). While the radiative
forcing is generally negative, positive forcing occurs in areas with
a very high surface reflectance such as desert regions in North
Africa, and the snow fields of the Himalayas. This is because
biomass burning aerosols contain black carbon and are partially
absorbing. The dependency of the sign of the radiative forcing
from partially absorbing aerosols upon the surface reflectance has
been investigated by a number of recent studies (e.g., Chylek and
Wong, 1995; Chylek et al., 1995; Haywood and Shine, 1995;
Hansen et al., 1997a). The strongest negative radiative forcing is
associated with regions of intense biomass burning activity

and differ from the regions where the sulphate radiative forcing is
strongest (Figure 6.7d), being confined to approximately 30°N to

where the radiative forcing is strongest in the Northern
Hemisphere corresponding to the main industrialised regions of

Hemisphere, two less strong regions are seen. The ratio of the

Generally, the strongest sulphate direct radiative forcing occurs
over land areas although the low surface reflectance means that
areas of water close to heavily industrialised regions such as the
Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea result in
strong local radiative forcings. Due to the large areal extent of

"The areas of strongest negative forcing occur at northern latitudes
of the Northern Hemisphere due to the felling of forests which
have a lower albedo when snow is present (see Section 6.13).
Additional effects are due to the change in albedo between crop
lands and naturally occurring vegetation. Examples where the
radiative forcing is positive include areas where irrigation has

enabled crop-growing on previously barren land.

The knowledge of the various forcing mechanisms varies
substantially (see Section 6.13) and, for some, the knowledge of
their time evolution is more problematic than for others. For
example, well-mixed greenhouse gas concentrations are
observed very accurately from about 1950, with observations
even further back in time, whereas data for most aerosol
components are much more scarce and uncertain. Uncertainties
in the evolution of many of the radiative forcing mechanisms
shown in Figure 6.8 have not been assessed yet, and the presented
time history should be regarded as an example of a possible
evolution.

"IPCC (1990) showed time evolution of the radiative forcing due
to the well-mixed greenhouse gases. For the other radiative
forcing mechanisms, the previous IPCC reports (IPCC, 1990;
SAR) did not consider the evolution of the radiative forcing, and
assessed mainly the radiative fluxes in the pre-industrial and
present epochs. However, more recent studies have considered
the time evolution of several forcing mechanisms (Hansen et al.,
1993; Wigley er al., 1997; Myhre et al., 2001). The information
on the time evolution of the radiative forcing from pre-industrial
times to present illustrates the differing importance of the various
radiative forcing mechanisms over the various time periods, as
well as the different start times of their perturbation of the
radiative balance. It also gives useful information in the form of

"The forcing mechanisms, considered, where information on
their time evolution is available, are plotted in Figure 6.8, with
the present forcing corresponding to the best estimates given in
Section 6.13. The time evolution differs considerably among the
forcing mechanisms as different processes controlling the
emissions and lifetimes are involved. Concentrations of the well-
mixed greenhouse gases are taken from Chapters 3 and 4 and the
simplified expressions for the radiative forcing in Table 6.2 (first
row for CO;) are used. The evolution of the radiative forcing due
to tropospheric O; is taken from Berntsen er al. (2000). For the
radiative forcing due to stratospheric O3, information on the
evolution is taken from the SAR and scaled to the present forcing
of -0.15 Wm (Section 6.4).

While the preceding sections have shown that the radiative
forcing due to the different forcing mechanisms have very
different spatial distributions, it is essential to note that the
forcing/response relationship given in Section 6.2 relates global
mean radiative forcings to global mean temperature response.
Thus, it is not possible to simply map the geographical radiative
forcing mechanisms by assuming a globally invariant climate
sensitivity parameter to predict a geographic temperature
response, due to the complex nature of the atmosphere-ocean
system. Rather, the effects of spatial inhomogeneity in the distri-
bution of the radiative forcing may lead to locally different
responses in surface temperature (Section 6.2) indicating that the
spatial distributions of the radiative forcing need to be accurately
represented to improve regional estimates of surface temperature
response and other physical parameters.

An example of the present day radiative forcing due to solar
variability is shown in Figure 6.7k. The solar radiative forcing
was calculated by scaling the top of the atmosphere net solar
radiation such that the global average is +0.3 Wm (as deduced
for global average radiative forcing since 1750, see Section
6.13.1). Thus it assumes a 0.125% increase in solar constant and
no change in any other parameter (e.g., O3, cloud). The cloud and
radiation fields were calculated within a run of the UGAMP
GCM (Haigh, 1996). The strongest radiative forcings exist where
the surface reflectance is low (i.e., oceanic regions) and the
insolation is highest (i.e., equatorial regions). The solar radiative
forcing is also modulated by cloud amount, areas with low cloud
amount showing the strongest radiative forcing. The solar
radiative forcing is more inhomogeneous than the radiative
forcing due to gaseous species (Section 6.14.1), but more
homogeneous than the radiative forcing due to aerosol species
(Section 6.14.2).

"For sulphate, the time evolution for SO, emission
(Schlesinger et al., 1992) is used, updated with values after 1990
(Stern and Kaufmann, 1996). For black and organic carbon
aerosols, the fossil fuel component is scaled to coal, diesel, and
oil use and fossil fuel emission (IPCC, 1996b), respectively.
Altered emission coefficients as a result of improved technology
have not been taken into account and is a substantial uncertainty
for the time evolution of the black carbon emission. The biomass
component is scaled to the gross deforestation (see SAR). In
addition to different forcing mechanisms of anthropogenic origin,
two natural forcings have also been considered: solar irradiance
variations and stratospheric aerosols of volcanic origin. The Lean
et al. (1995) and Hoyt and Schatten (1993) estimates of direct
solar forcing due to variation in total solar irradiance are shown.
Differences between the solar irradiance constructions are due to
use of different proxy parameters for the solar irradiance
variations (Section 6.11). The optical depth of the stratospheric
aerosols of volcanic origin is taken from Sato et al. (1993) and
Robock and Free (1996). The data from Sato et al. (1993)
(updated from www.giss.nasa.gov) are given for the period 1850
to 1998, whereas those from Robock and Free (1996) are for the
period 1750 to 1988. In Robock and Free (1996) the optical depth
is given for the Northern Hemisphere. The relationship between
optical depth and radiative forcing from Lacis et al. (1992) is
used. The stratospheric aerosols yield a very strong forcing
immediately after major eruptions (Section 6.9); however, the
lifetime of the stratospheric aerosols is only a few years. Therefore,

The relative evolution of the strengths of the different forcing
mechanisms presented above are seen to be very different. The
forcing due to well-mixed greenhouse gases (consisting of the
components listed in Table 6.11) is the dominant forcing
mechanism over the century time period. For tropospheric O3, the
relative radiative forcing compared to the well-mixed greenhouse
gases has slightly increased; it was 10% of the well-mixed
greenhouse gas forcing in 1900 and is 15% at present. The
stratospheric O3 forcing is significant only over the last two

well-mixed greenhouse gases, and their forcings at any given
time depend on the current emissions. This is not the case for the
well-mixed greenhouse gases for which both current and
previous emissions are relevant. Table 6.13 shows five year
averages for the radiative forcings denoted in Figure 6.8 over the
period 1960 to 1995. For some of the forcing mechanisms a large
increase in the radiative forcing (computed since pre-industrial

From Table 6.11, the “radiative forcing due to CO, is at
present slightly larger than 50% of the total greenhouse gas
forcing (including tropospheric O3). In 2050 and 2100 the SRES
scenarios indicate a stronger dominance of CO, on the total
greenhouse gas forcing (including tropospheric O3), at about 70 to
80% of the total forcing. The SRES scenarios indicate that HFC-

The radiative forcings associated with future tropospheric O;

by Chapter 4 and presented in Appendix II, Table II.2.5 for the
various SRES scenarios. The mean forcing per DU estimated from
the various models and given in Table 6.3 (i.e., 0.042 Wm/DU) is
used to derive these future forcings. Most scenarios lead to
increases in the abundances of tropospheric O3 and consequently
to positive radiative forcings in 2050 and 2100. Scenarios A1fi,
A2, and A2p provide the maximum tropospheric O; forcings
reaching 0.89 Wm~ in 2100. Only scenario B1 predicts a
decrease in tropospheric O3 and a negative forcing of —0.16

The direct radiative forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate, black

carbon (BC), and organic carbon (OC) aerosols are assessed using
the scenarios described in Chapter 5, Section 5.5.3 and the column
burdens presented in Appendix II, Tables II.2.7, 1.2.8 and 11.2.9
respectively. Scenarios for mineral dust are not considered here, as
there is no “best estimate” available (Sections 6.7.6 and 6.13). For
each aerosol species, the ratio of the column burdens for the
particular scenario to that of the year 2000 is multiplied by the
“best estimate” of the present day radiative forcing. The year 2000
“best estimate” radiative forcing is then subtracted to give the
radiative forcing for the period from the year 2000 to the date of
the scenario. Estimates of the direct radiative forcing for each of
the aerosol species are given in Table 6.15.

"As seen from Figure 6.8d the radiative forcing due to strato-
spheric aerosols of volcanic activity has very large year to year
variations. The solar irradiance, according to the two reconstruc-
tions, generally increases and may have contributed in an
important manner to the warming in the 20th century, particularly
in the period from 1900 to 1950. Volcanic activity was particularly
strong around 1900 and at different times since 1963. Table 6.13
shows a strong radiative forcing due to the temporal evolution of
the stratospheric aerosols of volcanic origin during the period
1961 to 1965; however, the strongest forcing in the course of the
past four decades has occurred over the period from 1991 to 1995.
The temporal evolution of the stratospheric aerosol content
together with the small solar irradiance variations during the last
few (two to four) decades indicates that the natural forcing has
been negative over the past two and possibly even the past four
decades. In contrast, the positive forcing due to well-mixed
greenhouse gases has increased rapidly over the past four decades.

"The uncertainty associated with these estimates of the direct
radiative forcing is necessarily higher than the estimates for the
year 2000. This is because estimates for the year 2000 are
constrained as best as possible to observations. Additionally, the
simplified approach applied here does not account for changes in
the spatial pattern of the global distribution of the aerosol species
that may arise from changes in the geographic distribution of
emissions. The uncertainty is therefore estimated as a factor of
three for the radiative forcing by sulphate aerosols, and a factor of
four for the radiative forcing by BC and OC aerosols.

As for the aerosol direct effect, the uncertainty associated
with these estimates is higher than for the estimates for the present
day. Considering the very low LOSU of the indirect aerosol effect
and the fact that no best estimate was recommended for the
present day (Sections 6.8 and 6.13), the numbers provided in
Table 6.16 give only a rough indication of how the forcings could
change between the present and the future (according to the SRES
scenarios) in three different models. Relative to 2000, the change
in the direct plus indirect aerosol radiative forcing is projected to
be smaller in magnitude than that of CO).

Planck/Dalhousie model used the mechanistic formulation of
Chuang et al. (1997) as described in Lohmann et al. (1999a,b,
2000) and includes both the “first” and “second” indirect effects.
In addition, the Max-Planck/Dalhousie model used monthly
averaged dust and sea salt fields from the LLNL/Umich model.
Further details of the models are provided in Chapter 5. The
indirect radiative forcing scenarios are summarised in Table 6.16,
and represent the radiative forcing from the year 2000 due to
sulphate and carbonaceous aerosols. Some simulations suggest
that changes in the concentrations of natural aerosols due to
changes in the climate could also contribute to a negative aerosol
indirect effect (see Chapter 5).

"For sulphate aerosols, only scenarios Alfi, A2, and A2p show
a negative direct radiative forcing for the period 2000 to 2050,
with all scenarios showing positive radiative forcings over the
period 2000 to 2100. This contrasts with the IS92a scenario which
predicted an increasingly negative radiative forcing due to the
higher column burden of sulphate. For BC aerosols the majority
of the scenarios show an increasingly positive direct radiative
forcing in 2050 and 2100 (except for B1 and Blp). For OC
aerosols, the opposite is true, with the majority of scenarios
showing an increasingly negative direct radiative forcing in 2050
and 2100 (except for B1 and Blp). The direct aerosol radiative
forcing evolution due to sulphate, black and organic carbon
aerosols taken together varies in sign for the different scenarios.
The magnitudes are much smaller than that for CO. As with the
trace gases, there is considerable variation amongst the different
scenarios.

"	Title
"The principal elements of the radiative forcing concept are
summarised below.

"	List
"(C) The stratosphere is a fast response system which, in response
to an imposed radiative perturbation, comes into equilibrium on
a time-scale (about a few months) that is much more rapid than
the surface-troposphere system (typically decades) (Hansen et
al., 1997a; Shine and Forster, 1999). The latter is a slow response
system owing principally to the thermal inertia of the oceans.
"	Text
"(A) The concept was developed first in the context of the one-
dimensional radiative-convective models that investigated the
equilibrated global, annual mean surface temperature responses
to radiative perturbations caused by changes in the concentrations
of radiatively active species (Manabe and Wetherald, 1967;
Ramanathan and Coakley, 1978; WMO, 1986). Over the past
decade, the concept has been extended to cover different spatial
dimensions and seasonal time-scales (IPCC, 1992, 1994).
"	Text
"For the arbitrary space and time mean stratosphere, there arises
the need to evaluate the radiative flux changes with the strato-
sphere in a radiative-dynamical equilibrium. A classical method
to determine this is the “Fixed Dynamical Heating” (FDH;
WMO, 1995) in which it is assumed that the dynamical heating
rate in the stratosphere is unchanged and that the stratosphere
comes to a new thermal equilibrium in response to the perturba-
tion through adjustments in the temperature profile, such that a
"	Text
"(D) When a perturbation is applied (such as increases in well-
mixed greenhouse gases), there is an instantaneous change in
irradiances that is manifest in general as a radiative imbalance
(forcing) at the surface, tropopause and the top of the atmosphere.
The rapid thermal re-equilibration of the stratosphere leads to an
alteration of the radiative imbalance imposed on the surface-
troposphere system (WMO, 1992), thereby yielding an adjusted
forcing (SAR). The surface and troposphere, operating in a slow
response mode, are still in a process of adjustment while the
stratosphere has already reached its new equilibrium state. The
SAR points out the clear distinction existing between the instan-
taneous and adjusted forcings.
"	Text
"(F) A major motivation for the radiative forcing concept is the
ease of climate change analysis when radiative forcing, feedback,
and climate response are distinguished from one another. Such a
separation is possible in the modelling framework where forcing
and feedback can be evaluated separately e.g., for the case of CO)
doubling effects (see Dickinson, 1982; Dickinson and Cicerone,
1986; Cess and Potter, 1988; Cess et al., 1993). The considera-
tion of forcing, feedback and response as three distinct entities in
the modelling framework (see also Charlson, 2000) while
originating from the one-dimensional radiative/convective
models, has made the transition to GCM studies of climate
(Hansen et al., 1981; Wetherald and Manabe, 1988; Chen and
Ramaswamy, 1996a).
"	Text
"(B) In the one-dimensional radiative-convective model
framework, the surface and troposphere are closely coupled,
behaving as a single thermodynamic system under the joint
control of radiative and convective processes, with a specified
lapse rate determining the thermal structure. The stratospheric
state is determined by the radiative equilibrium condition. The
stratosphere and troposphere irradiances are together constrained
by the requirement that the top of the atmosphere net total irradi-
ance (i.e., radiative energy absorbed minus that emitted by the
Earth’s entire climate system) must be zero at equilibrium. In
applying the forcing concept to arbitrary spatial and seasonal
time-scales, as opposed to the global annual mean, it has been
assumed (WMO, 1992; SAR) that the stratosphere is in radiative-
dynamical (rather than radiative) equilibrium (see (D) below).
"	Text
"(E) As a direct consequence of the above, the forcing definition
most appropriate for the response of the surface-troposphere
system to a radiative perturbation is the net (down minus up)
radiative (solar plus long-wave) change defined at the tropopause
after the stratosphere has come to a new thermal equilibrium
state. Thus, the level at which the tropopause is assumed in the
models is an important aspect for the quantitative determination
of the forcing (Forster et al., 1997), as is the model vertical
resolution used to resolve the vicinity of the tropopause region
(Shine et al., 1995). The classical radiative-convective model
definition of the tropopause considers it as a boundary between a
region where radiative-convective equilibrium prevails (i.e.,
troposphere) and a region that is in radiative (or radiative-
dynamical, i.e., stratosphere) equilibrium. Such a distinction
could be ambiguous in the case of the three-dimensional GCMs
or the real world. However, radiative forcing appears to be
relatively robust to changes in the definition of the tropopause in
a GCM (Christiansen, 1999).
"	Text
"new radiative-dynamical equilibrium is attained (radiative
response; see Ramanathan and Dickinson (1979) and Fels et al.
(1980)). The resulting adjustment process in the stratosphere
makes an additional contribution to the forcing of the surface-
troposphere system. When the stratosphere has adjusted to a new
radiative-dynamical equilibrium with resultant changes to its
thermal state, the change in flux at the tropopause and at the top
of the atmosphere become identical. It is important that the
stratosphere be in radiative-dynamical equilibrium and, as shown
by Hansen et al. (1997a), it is the adjusted rather than the instan-
taneous forcing that is a more relevant indicator of the surface
temperature response. The adjustment of stratosphere is crucial
for some of the forcings, but not for all of them (Shine and
Forster, 1999). In the case of some radiative perturbations, the
stratosphere is hardly perturbed and the instantaneous and
adjusted radiative flux changes thus tend to be similar (SAR). In
other cases, there is only a small (20% or less) influence due to
the stratospheric adjustment process. However, for the case of
ozone depletion in the lower stratosphere, the effect of a strato-
spheric adjustment could even yield a change in the sign of the
forcing.

"(H) The foregoing governing factors reflect the fundamental
recognition that, in response to an externally imposed radiative
forcing, there is a shift in the equilibrium state of the climate
system. This forcing of the climate change in the IPCC parlance
is to be distinguished from forcing definitions initiated for other
purposes, e.g., cloud forcing (Ramanathan ef al., 1989), sea
surface temperature related forcing during ENSO periods, etc.

"of the radiative forcing. For example, in the case of a change in
the concentration of a radiatively active species, the term “state”
implies that all parameters are held at the unperturbed values with
only the concerned species’ concentration being changed. Thus,
in the strictest sense, temperature in the troposphere, water
vapour and clouds in the entire atmosphere, and circulation, are
held fixed in the computation of the irradiance changes at the
tropopause, with only the stratosphere adjusted to a new thermal
equilibrium state via the radiative response. In contrast to this
prescription for calculating the forcing, the resulting changes in
the meteorological and climatic parameters (e.g., tropospheric
temperature and water vapour) constitute responses to the
imposed perturbation (WMO, 1986; Charlson, 2000). In the
IPCC context, the change in a radiative agent’s characteristic has
involved anthropogenic (e.g., CO) and natural (e.g., aerosols
after a volcanic eruption) perturbations.
"	Text
"It is important to emphasise that changes in water vapour in the
troposphere are viewed as a feedback variable rather than a
forcing agent. However, in the case of the second indirect aerosol
forcing, the separation is less distinct. Anthropogenic emissions
(e.g., aircraft, fossil fuel) or precursors to water vapour are
negligible. The same is true for changes in water vapour in the
stratosphere, except in the instance that the oxidation of CH,
provides an input. Changes in the condensed liquid and solid
phases of water (i.e., clouds) are also considered as part of the
climate feedback. The strict requirement of no feedbacks in the
surface and troposphere demands that no secondary effects such
as changes in troposphere motions or its thermodynamic state, or
dynamically-induced changes in water substance in the surface
and atmosphere, be included in the evaluation of the net irradi-
ance change at the tropopause. (Note: the second indirect effect
of aerosols consists of microphysically-induced changes in the
water substance.)

"Probably the greatest uncertainty in future projections of
climate arises from clouds and their interactions with radiation.
Cloud feedbacks depend upon changes in cloud height, amount,
and radiative properties, including short-wave absorption. The
radiative properties depend upon cloud thickness, particle size,
shape, and distribution and on aerosol effects. The evolution of
clouds depends upon a host of processes, mainly those governing

Atmospheric feedbacks largely control climate sensitivity.
Important progress has been made in the understanding of those
processes, partly by utilising new data against which models can
be compared. Since the Second Assessment Report (IPCC, 1996)
(hereafter SAR), there has been a better appreciation of the
complexity of the mechanisms controlling water vapour distribu-
tion. Within the boundary layer, water vapour increases with
increasing temperatures. In the free troposphere above the
boundary layer, where the greenhouse effect of water vapour is
most important, the situation is less amenable to straightforward
thermodynamic arguments. In models, increases in water vapour
in this region are the most important reason for large responses to
increased greenhouse gases.

Water vapour feedback, as derived from current models,
approximately doubles the warming from what it would be for
fixed water vapour. Since the SAR, major improvements have
occurred in the treatment of water vapour in models, although
detrainment of moisture from clouds remains quite uncertain and
discrepancies exist between model water vapour distributions and
those observed. It is likely that some of the apparent discrepancy
is due to observational error and shortcomings in intercompar-
ison methodology. Models are capable of simulating the moist
and very dry regions observed in the tropics and sub-tropics and
how they evolve with the seasons and from year to year,
indicating that the models have successfully incorporated the
basic processes governing water vapour distribution. While
reassuring, this does not provide a definitive check of the
feedbacks, though the balance of evidence favours a positive
clear-sky water vapour feedback of a magnitude comparable to
that found in simulations.

"the distribution of water vapour. The physical basis of the cloud
parametrizations included into the models has also been greatly
improved. However, this increased physical veracity has not
reduced the uncertainty attached to cloud feedbacks: even the
sign of this feedback remains unknown. A key issue, which also
has large implications for changes in precipitation, is the
sensitivity of sub-grid scale dynamical processes, turbulent and
convective, to climate change. It depends on sub-grid features of
surface conditions such as orography. Equally important are
microphysical processes, which have only recently been
introduced explicitly in the models, and carry major uncertain-
ties. The possibility that models underestimate solar absorption in
clouds remains controversial, as does the effect of such an
underestimate on climate sensitivity. The importance of the
structure of the stratosphere and both radiative and dynamical
processes have been recognised, and limitations in representing
stratospheric processes add some uncertainty to model results.

"Considerable advances have been made in the understanding of
processes and feedbacks in the climate system. This has led to a
better representation of processes and feedbacks in numerical
climate models, which have become much more comprehensive.
Because of the presence of non-linear processes in the climate
system, deterministic projections of changes are potentially
subject to uncertainties arising from sensitivity to initial
conditions or to parameter settings. Such uncertainties can be
partially quantified from ensembles of climate change integra-
tions, made using different models starting from different initial
conditions. They necessarily give rise to probabilistic estimates
of climate change. This results in more quantitative estimates of
uncertainties and more reliable projections of anthropogenic
climate change. While improved parametrizations have built
confidence in some areas, recognition of the complexity in other
areas has not indicated an overall reduction or shift in the current
range of uncertainty of model response to changes in atmospheric
composition.

In the Atlantic, the thermohaline circulation (THC) is
responsible for the major part of the ocean meridional heat
transport associated with warm and saline surface waters flowing
northward and cold and fresh waters from the North Atlantic
returning at depth. The interplay between the large-scale
atmospheric forcing, with warming and evaporation in low
latitudes, and cooling and net precipitation at high latitudes,
forms the basis of a potential instability of the present Atlantic
THC. Changes in ENSO may also influence the Atlantic THC by
altering the fresh water balance of the tropical Atlantic, therefore
providing a coupling between low and high latitudes. Uncertainty
resides with the relative importance of feedbacks associated with
processes influencing changes in high latitude sea surface temper-
atures and salinities, such as atmosphere-ocean heat and fresh
water fluxes, formation and transport of sea ice, continental runoff
and the large-scale transports in ocean and atmosphere. The
Atlantic THC is likely to change over the coming century but its
evolution continues to be an unresolved issue. While some recent
calculations find little changes in the THC, most projections

"Considerable improvements have taken place in modelling
ocean processes. In conjunction with an increase in resolution,
these improvements have, in some models, allowed a more
realistic simulation of the transports and air-sea fluxes of heat and
fresh water, thereby reducing the need for flux adjustments in
coupled models. These improvements have also contributed to
better simulations of natural large-scale circulation patterns such
as El Nifio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the oceanic
response to atmospheric variability associated with the North
Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). However, significant deficiencies in
ocean models remain. Boundary currents in climate simulations
are much weaker and wider than in nature, though the
consequences of this fact for the global climate sensitivity are not
clear. Improved parametrizations of important sub-grid scale
processes, such as mesoscale eddies, have increased the realism
of simulations but important details are still under debate. Major
uncertainties still exist with the representation of small-scale
processes, such as overflows and flow through narrow channels
(e.g., between Greenland and Iceland), western boundary
currents (i.e., large-scale narrow currents along coastlines),
convection, and mixing.

"Possible non-linear changes in the climate system as a result
of anthropogenic climate forcing have received considerable
attention in the last few years. Employing the entire climate
model hierarchy, and combining these results with palaeo-
climatic evidence and instrumental observation, has shown that
mode changes in all components of the climate system have
occurred in the past and may also take place in the future. Such
changes may be associated with thresholds in the climate system.
Such thresholds have been identified in many climate models
and there is an increasing understanding of the underlying
processes. Current model simulations indicate that the thresholds
may lie within the reaches of projected changes. However, it is
not yet possible to give reliable values of such thresholds.

Climate change may manifest itself both as shifting means
as well as changing preference of specific regimes, as evidenced
by the observed trend toward positive values for the last 30 years
in the NAO index and the climate “shift” in the tropical Pacific
in about 1976. While coupled models simulate features of
observed natural climate variability such as the NAO and ENSO,
suggesting that many of the relevant processes are included in the
models, further progress is needed to depict these natural modes
accurately. Moreover, because ENSO and NAO are key determi-
nants of regional climate change, and they can possibly result in
abrupt and counter-intuitive changes, there has been an increase
in uncertainty in those aspects of climate change that critically
depend on regional changes.

also been shown to provide a powerful diagnostic capability for
tracking climatic impacts on surface conditions; e.g., droughts

The direct effects of increased carbon dioxide (CO,) on vegeta-

transpiration over the tropical continents, with associated
regional warming over that predicted for conventional
greenhouse warming effects. On time-scales of decades these
effects could significantly influence the rate of atmospheric CO,
increase, the nature and extent of the physical climate system
response, and ultimately, the response of the biosphere itself to
global change. In addition, such models must be used to account
for the climatic effects of land-use change which can be very
significant at local and regional scales. However, realistic land-
use change scenarios for the next 50 to 100 years are not
expected to give rise to global scale climate changes comparable
to those resulting from greenhouse gas warming. Significant
modelling problems remain to be solved in the areas of soil
moisture processes, runoff prediction, land-use change, and the
treatment of snow and sub-grid scale heterogeneity.

with observation (both spatial and temporal), but so too must
the component models and the processes that are involved in the

whether it comes out that way for the right reason and with the
right variability. By examining how well individual processes

"The key problem to be addressed is the response of the climate
system to changes in forcing. In many cases there is a fairly direct
and linear response and many of the simulated changes fall into
that class (Chapter 9). These concern the large-scale general
circulations of the atmosphere and ocean, and they are in
principle represented in current comprehensive coupled climate
models. Such possible large-scale dynamical feedbacks are also
influenced by small-scale processes within the climate system.
The various feedbacks in the climate system may amplify
(positive feedbacks), or diminish (negative feedbacks) the
original response. We often approximate the response of a partic-
ular variable to a small forcing by a scaling number. A prominent
example of such a quantification is the equilibrium global mean
temperature increase per Wm? change in the global mean
atmospheric radiative forcing (see Chapter 9, Section 9.2.1).

While many aspects of the response of the climate system
to greenhouse gas forcing appear to be linear, regime or mode
transitions cannot be quantified by a simple number because
responses do not scale with the amplitude of the forcing: small
perturbations can induce large changes in certain variables of
the climate system. This implies the existence of thresholds in
the climate system which can be crossed for a sufficiently large
perturbation. While such behaviour has long been known and
studied in the context of simple models of the climate system,
such thresholds are now also found in the comprehensive
coupled climate models currently available. Within this
framework, the possibility for irreversible changes in the
climate system exists. This insight, backed by the palaeo-
climatic record (see Chapter 2, Section 2.4), is a new challenge
for global change science because now thresholds have to be
identified and their values need to be estimated using the entire
hierarchy of climate models.

In order to be able to make reliable forecasts in the presence
of both initial condition and model uncertainty, it is now
becoming common to repeat the prediction many times from
different perturbed initial states, and using different global
models (from the stock of global models that exist in the world
weather and climate modelling community). These so-called
multi-model, multi-initial-condition ensembles are the optimal
basis of probability forecasts (e.g., of a weather event, El Nifio,

is some evidence that aspects of the physical climate system are

the emergence of the role of natural modes of the climate system

There is a growing appreciation of the importance of the
stratosphere, particularly the lower stratosphere, in the climate
system. Since the mass of the stratosphere represents only about
10 to 20% of the atmospheric mass, the traditional view has been
that the stratosphere can play only a limited role in climate
change. However, this view is changing. The transport and distri-
bution of radiatively active constituents, especially water vapour
and ozone, are important for radiative forcing. Moreover, waves
generated in the troposphere propagate into the stratosphere and
are absorbed, so that stratospheric changes alter where and how
they are absorbed, and effects can extend downward into the
troposphere.

Recent model simulations, including new land-surface
parametrizations and field observations, strongly indicate that
large-scale changes in land use can lead to significant impacts on
the regional climate. The terrestrial carbon and water cycles are
also linked through vegetation physiology, which regulates the
ratio of carbon dioxide (CO ) uptake (photosynthesis) to water
loss (evapotranspiration). As a result, vegetation water-use
efficiency is likely to change with increasing atmospheric CO,,
leading to a reduction in evapotranspiration over densely
vegetated areas. Tropical deforestation, in particular, is associated
with local warming and drying. However, realistic land-use
change scenarios for the next 50 to 100 years are not expected to
give rise to global scale climate changes comparable to those
resulting from greenhouse gas warming.

warming cannot be excluded and would occur if certain thresh-
olds are crossed. Models have identified the maximum strength
of greenhouse gas induced forcing and the rate of increase as
thresholds for the maintenance of the THC in the Atlantic ocean,
an important process influencing the climate of the Northern
Hemisphere. While such thresholds have been found in a variety
of fundamentally different models, suggesting that their existence
in the climate system is a robust result, we cannot yet determine
with accuracy the values of these thresholds, because they
crucially depend on the response of the atmospheric hydrological

The number of ensemble members required to estimate
reliably changes to the probability distribution of a given climatic
phenomenon depends on the phenomenon in question.
Estimating changes in the probability distribution of localised
extreme weather events, which by their nature occur infrequently,
may require very large ensembles with hundreds of members.
Estimating changes in the probability distribution of large scale
frequent events (e.g., the probability of above-average
hemispheric mean temperature) requires much smaller
ensembles.

"Determination of the new equilibrium is complicated by the
fact that water vapour is itself a potent greenhouse gas, and the
amount and distribution of water vapour will generally change as
the climate changes. The atmospheric water vapour content
responds to changes in temperature, microphysical processes and
the atmospheric circulation. An overarching consideration is that
the maximum amount of water vapour air can hold increases
rapidly with temperature, in accord with the Clausius-Clapeyron
relation. This affects all aspects of the hydrological cycle. Unlike
CO), water vapour concentration varies substantially in both the
vertical and horizontal. An increase in water vapour reduces the
OLR only if it occurs at an altitude where the temperature is lower
than the ground temperature, and the impact grows sharply as the
temperature difference increases. If water vapour at such places
increases as the climate warms, then the additional reduction in
OLR requires the new equilibrium to be warmer than it would
have been if water vapour content had remained fixed. This is
referred to as a positive water vapour feedback.

(i) In the tropical free troposphere, ascent is generally
concentrated in intense, narrow, and nearly vertical
cumulonimbus towers, with descent occurring slowly over the
broad remaining area. The moist regions are broader than the
narrow ascending towers and are mostly descending. The vicinity
of convective towers is moistened by evaporation of precipitation
from the cirrus outflow of the cumulus towers above about 5 km
and by the dissipation and mixing of cumulonimbus towers
below about 5 km and above the trade wind boundary layer.
Cloud coverage thus depends on the detrainment of ice from
cumulus towers (Gamache and Houze, 1983). The ice content of
the detrained air depends in turn on the efficiency of precipitation
within the tower, i.e., condensed water which falls as rain within
the towers is no longer available for detrainment. The association
of high stratiform cloud cover with high relative humidity was
clearly illustrated by Udelhofen and Hartmann (1995), and in the
tropics upper-tropospheric humidity (UTH) is tied to the
frequency of deep convection (Soden and Fu, 1995).

The boundary layer is the turbulent, well-mixed shallow layer
near the ground, which can be regarded as being directly
moistened by evaporation from the surface. In the boundary layer,
the increase in water vapour with temperature in proportion with
the Clausius-Clapeyron relation is uncontroversial. Observations
(e.g., Wentz and Schabel, 2000) clearly show a very strong
relation of total column water vapour (precipitable water) with
surface and tropospheric temperature. Because the boundary-layer
temperature is similar to that of the ground, however, boundary-
layer water vapour is not of direct significance to the water vapour
feedback. Furthermore, half of the atmospheric water vapour is
below 850 mb, so measurements of total column water have
limited utility in understanding water vapour feedback. The part of
the troposphere above the boundary layer is referred to as the “free
troposphere”. Water vapour is brought to the free troposphere by
a variety of mixing and transport processes, and water vapour
feedback is determined by the aggregate effects of changes in the
transport and in the rate at which water is removed by precipita-
tion occurring when air parcels are cooled, usually by rising

motions.

Water vapour feedback acting alone approximately doubles the
warming from what it would be for fixed water vapour (Cess et

Most of the free troposphere is highly undersaturated with
respect to water, so that local water-holding capacity is not the
limiting factor determining atmospheric water vapour. Within the
constraints imposed by Clausius-Clapeyron alone there is ample
scope for water vapour feedbacks either stronger or weaker than
those implied by constant relative humidity, especially in connec-
tion with changes in the area of the moist tropical convective
region (Pierrehumbert, 1999). It has been estimated that, without
changes in the relative area of convective and dry regions, a shift
of water vapour to lower levels in the dry regions could, at the
extreme, lead to a halving of the currently estimated water vapour
feedback, but could not actually cause it to become a negative,
stabilising feedback (Harvey, 2000).

large-scale wave motions with comparable ascending and
descending areas (Yang and Pierrehumbert, 1994; Hu and Liu,

evaporation, which is a maximum in the sub-tropics, and the
boundary-layer reservoir of water vapour that is tapped by extra-
tropical waves. Observations confirm that extra-tropical free

As noted by Held and Soden (2000), the relative sensitivity of
OLR to water vapour changes at various locations depends on
how one perturbs the water vapour profile; the appropriate choice
depends entirely on the nature of the water vapour perturbation
anticipated in a changing climate. The sensitivity is also affected
by cloud radiative effects, which tend to mask the influence of
sub-cloud water vapour on OLR. Incorporating cloud radiative
effects and a fixed relative humidity perturbation (argued to be
most appropriate to diagnosing GCM water vapour feedback),
Held and Soden suggest that OLR is almost uniformly sensitive to
water vapour perturbations throughout the tropics. Roughly 55%
of the total is due to the free troposphere in the “tropics” (30°N to

General circulation models do not impose a fixed relative
humidity. Assumptions built into the models directly govern the
relative humidity only in the sparse set of grid boxes that are
actively convecting, where the choice of convection scheme
determines the humidity. In the case of moist convective adjust-
ment, the relative humidity after convection is explicitly set to a
predetermined profile, whereas the mass flux schemes compute a
humidity profile based on microphysical assumptions of varying
complexity. The relative humidity elsewhere is determined by
explicitly resolved dynamical processes, and in fact undergoes
marked spatial (e.g., Figure 7.1b,c) and temporal fluctuations.
Nonetheless, all models studied to date produce a positive water
vapour feedback consistent with the supposition that water
vapour increases in such a way as to keep the relative humidity
approximately unchanged at all levels (Held and Soden, 2000).
The strength of the water vapour feedback is consistent amongst
models, despite considerable differences in the treatment of
convection and microphysics (Cess etal., 1990).

must still be taken with the design of numerical advection
methods to avoid spurious transport. In this regard, there has been
notable progress since the SAR as models are increasingly using
semi-Lagrangian and other advanced advection methods in place
of spectral advection of water vapour (Williamson and Rasch,

Indirect evidence for validity of the positive water vapour
feedback in present models can be found in studies of interannual
variability of global mean temperature: Hall and Manabe (1999)
found that suppression of positive water vapour feedback in the
GFDL model led to unrealistically low variability. An important
development since the SAR is the proliferation of evidence that
the tropics during the Last Glacial Maximum were 2 to 5°C
colder than the present tropics. Much of the cooling can be
simulated in GCMs which incorporate the observed reduction in

vapour feedback comparable to that currently yielded by GCMs,
there would be a problem accounting for the magnitude of the
observed cooling in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere.

"Humidity is important to water vapour feedback only to the
extent that it alters OLR. Because the radiative effects of water
vapour are logarithmic in water vapour concentration, rather
large errors in humidity can lead to small errors in OLR, and
systematic underestimations in the contrast between moist and
dry air can have little effect on climate sensitivity (Held and
Soden, 2000). Most GCMs reproduce the climatological pattern
of clear-sky OLR very accurately (Duvel et al., 1997). In
addition, it has been shown that the CCM3 model tracks the
observed seasonal cycle of zonal mean clear-sky OLR to within
5 Wm” (Kiehl er al., 1998), the GFDL model reproduces tropical
mean OLR fluctuations over the course of an El Nifio event
(Soden, 1997), and the collection of models studied under the
AMIP project reproduces interannual variability of the clear-sky
greenhouse parameter with errors generally under 25% for sea
surface temperatures (SSTs) under 25°C (Duvel et al., 1997).
Errors become larger over warmer waters, owing to inaccuracies
in the way the simulated atmospheric circulation responds to the
imposed SSTs (which may also not be accurate). The LMD
model shows close agreement with the observed seasonal cycle
of greenhouse trapping (Bony et al., 1995), but models vary
considerably in their ability to track this cycle (Duvel er al.,

Emanuel (2000) showed that in a single-column model,
numerical convergence of the simulated water vapour profile
requires a vertical resolution better than 25 mb in pressure (see
also Emanuel and Zivkovic-Rothman, 1999). Thus, the apparent
lack of sensitivity of water vapour feedback in current GCMs to
the way convection is treated may be an artefact of insufficient
vertical resolution. An alternative view is that the water vapour
flux is vigorous enough to keep the convective region at a
substantial fraction of saturation, so that the details of the
moistening process do not matter much. In this case the convec-
tion essentially extends the boundary layer into the free
troposphere, making condensed water abundantly available to
evaporation, but in the form of droplets or crystals. Indeed,
Dessler and Sherwood (2000) find that satellite observations of
tropical water vapour can be understood without detailed
microphysical considerations, even in the convective region.
Radiosonde observations (Kley et al., 1997) and satellite UTH
data (Soden and Fu, 1995) reveal free troposphere relative
humidities of 50 to 70% throughout the convective region.
Udelhofen and Hartmann (1995) find that moisture decays away
from convective systems with a characteristic scale of 500 km, so
that convection need not be too closely spaced to maintain a
uniformly moistened region. As noted by Held and Soden (2000),
the evidence for the opposite view, that convective region air
becomes drier as temperature increases, is weak.

The successes of the current models lend some confidence to
their results. For a challenge to the current view of water vapour
feedback to succeed, relevant processes would have to be
incorporated into a GCM, and it would have to be shown that the
resulting GCM accounted for observations at least as well as the
current generation. A challenge that meets this test has not yet

of “upper-tropospheric” and “lower-tropospheric” water vapour,
and it was implied that lower-tropospheric water vapour feedback
was a Straightforward consequence of the Clausius-Clapeyron
relation. It is now appreciated that it is only in the boundary layer
that the control of water vapour by Clausius-Clapeyron can be
regarded as straightforward, so that “lower-tropospheric”
feedback is no less subtle than “upper-tropospheric’. It is more
meaningful to separate the problem instead into “boundary layer”
and “free tropospheric” water vapour, with the former

The potential complexity of the response of clouds to climate
change was identified in the SAR as a major source of
uncertainty for climate models. Although there has been clear
progress in the physical content of the models, clouds remain a
dominant source of uncertainty, because of the large variety of
interactive processes which contribute to cloud formation or
cloud-radiation interaction: dynamical forcing — large-scale or
sub-grid scale, microphysical processes controlling the growth
and phase of the various hydrometeors, complex geometry with
possible overlapping of cloud layers. Most of these processes are

A first generation of so- -called prognostic cloud schemes (Le

Treut and Li, 1991; Roeckner ef al., 1991; Senior and Mitchell,
1993; Del Genio et al., 1996), has used a budget equation for
cloud water, defined as the sum of all liquid and solid cloud water
species that have negligible vertical fall velocities. The method
allows for a temperature-dependent partitioning of the liquid and
ice phases, and thereby enables a bulk formulation of the
microphysical processes. By providing a time-scale for the
residence of condensed water in the atmosphere, it provides an
added physical consistency between the respective simulations of
condensation, precipitation and cloudiness. The realisation that
the transition between ice and liquid phase clouds was a key to
some potentially important feedbacks has prompted the use of
two or more explicit cloud and precipitation variables, thereby
allowing for a more physically based distinction between cloud
water and cloud ice (Fowler et al., 1996; Lohmann and Roeckner,

The conservation equations to determine the cloud water concen-
tration are written at the scale explicitly resolved by the model,
whereas a large part of the atmospheric dynamics generating
clouds is sub-grid scale. This is still an inconsistency in many
models, as clouds generated by large-scale or convective motions
are very often treated in a completely separate manner, with
obvious consequences on the treatment of anvils for example.
Several approaches help to reconcile these contradictions. Most
models using a prognostic approach of cloudiness use
probability density functions to describe the distribution of water
vapour within a grid box, and hence derive a consistent
fractional cover (Smith, 1990; Rotstayn, 1997). An alternative
approach, initially proposed by Tiedtke (1993), is to use a
conservation equation for cloud air mass as a way of integrating
the many small-scale processes which determine cloud cover
(Randall, 1995). Representations of sub-grid scale cloud
features also require assumptions about the vertical overlapping
of cloud layers, which in turn affect the determination of cloud
radiative forcing (Jacob and Klein, 1999; Morcrette and Jakob,

The interplay of buoyancy, moisture and condensation on scales
ranging from millimetres to tens of kilometres is the defining
physical feature of atmospheric convection, and is the source of
much of the challenge in representing convection in climate
models. Deep convection is in large measure responsible for the
very existence of the troposphere. Air typically receives its
buoyancy through being heated by contact with a warm, solar-
heated underlying surface, and convection redistributes the energy
received by the surface upwards throughout the troposphere.
Shallow convection also figures importantly in the structure of the

doubling accounting for combinations of different parametriza-

McAvaney, 1995; Yao and Del Genio, 1999; Meleshko et al.,

climate sensitivity are difficult to assess because the way a model
responds to changes in convection depends on a range of other
parametrizations, so results are somewhat inconsistent between
models (Colman and McAvaney, 1995; Thompson and Pollard,
1995; Zhang and McFarlane, 1995). There is some indication that
the climate sensitivity in models with strong negative cloud

In warm clouds these microphysical processes include the
collection of water molecules on a foreign substance (hetero-
geneous nucleation on a cloud condensation nucleus), diffusion,
collection of smaller drops when falling through a cloud (coales-
cence), break-up of drops when achieving a certain threshold size,
and re-evaporation of drops when falling through a layer of
unsaturated air. In cold clouds, ice particles may be nucleated from
either the liquid or vapour phase, and spontaneous homogeneous
freezing of supercooled liquid drops is also relevant at tempera-
tures below approximately —40°C. At higher temperatures the
formation of ice particles is dominated by heterogeneous
nucleation of water vapour on ice condensation nuclei. Subsequent
growth of ice particles is then due to diffusion of vapour toward
the particle (deposition), collection of other ice particles (aggrega-
tion), and collection of supercooled drops which freeze on contact
(timing). An increase in ice particles may occur by fragmentation.
Falling ice particles may melt when they come into contact with
air or liquid particles with temperatures above 0°C.

"There is ample theoretical and observational evidence that
deep moist convection locally establishes a “moist adiabatic”
temperature profile that, loosely speaking, is neutrally buoyant
with respect to ascending, condensing parcels (Betts, 1982; Xu
and Emanuel, 1989). This adjustment happens directly at the scale
of individual convective clouds, but dynamical processes
plausibly extend the radius of influence of the adjustment to the
scale of a typical GCM grid box, and probably much further in the
tropics, where the lapse rate adjusts close to the moist adiabat
almost everywhere. All convective schemes, from the most simple
Moist Adiabatic Adjustment to those which attempt a representa-
tion of cloud-scale motions (Arakawa and Schubert, 1974;
Emanuel, 1991), therefore agree in that they maintain the temper-
ature at a nearly moist adiabatic profile. Moist Adiabatic
Adjustment explicitly resets the temperature to the desired profile,
whereas mass flux schemes achieve the adjustment to a near-
adiabat as a consequence of equations governing the parametrized
convective heating field. The constraint on temperature, however,
places only a limited constraint on the moisture profile remaining
after adjustment, and the performance in terms of moisture, clouds
and precipitation may be very variable.

Atmospheric models have great difficulty in the proper
representation of turbulent mixing processes in general. This
also impacts on the representation of boundary-layer clouds. At
present, the underprediction of boundary-layer clouds is still
one of the most distinctive and permanent errors of AGCMs.
This has been demonstrated through AMIP intercomparisons by
Weare and Mokhov (1995) and also by Weare (2000b). It has a
very great importance, because the albedo effect of these clouds
is not compensated for by a significant greenhouse effect in

Schemes predicting cloudiness as a function of relative
humidity generally show an upward displacement of the higher
troposphere cloud cover in response to a greenhouse warming,
resulting in a positive feedback (Manabe and Wetherald, 1987).
While this effect still appears in more sophisticated models,

content as a prognostic variable, by decoupling cloud and
water vapour, has added new features (Senior and Mitchell,

feedback corresponding to an increase in cloud cover, and
hence cloud albedo, at the transition between ice and liquid
clouds occurs in some models, but is crucially dependent on
the definition of the phase transition within models. The sign
of the cloud cover feedback is still a matter of uncertainty and

convection. It is beyond question that the increased cloudiness
prevailing over the warmer portions of the Pacific has a strong
effect on the surface energy budget, which is fully competitive
with the importance of evaporation. Determination of SST,
however, requires a consistent treatment of the top-of-
atmosphere energy budget, and cannot be effected with
reference to the surface budget alone. This does not preclude
the possibility that other cloud feedback mechanisms could
have a profound effect on tropical SST, and in no way implies
that cloud representation is inconsequential in the tropics.
Meehl et al. (2000) illustrate this point when they show how a
change from a diagnostic prescription of clouds in the NCAR
atmospheric GCM to a prognostic cloud liquid water formula-
tion changes the sign of net cloud forcing in the eastern tropical
Pacific and completely alters the nature of the coupled model
response to increased greenhouse gases.

The highly variable rain rates and enormous spatial
variability makes determination of mean precipitation difficult, let
alone how it will change as the climate changes. For instance, a
detailed examination of spatial structure of daily precipitation
amounts by Osborn and Hulme (1997) shows that in Europe the
average separation distance between climate stations where the
correlation falls to 0.5 is about 150 km in summer and 200 km in
winter. This complexity makes it difficult to model precipitation
reliably, as many of the processes of importance cannot be
resolved by the model grid (typically 200 km) and so sub-grid
scale processes have to be parametrized.

Since the SAR, there has been progress in the qualitative
understanding of the complexity of cloud/climate relation.
There is also an important and ongoing evolution of the cloud
parametrizations included into the models, which is charac-
terised by a greater physical consistency and a greatly enhanced
physical content: in particular many models now include a more
comprehensive representation of sub-grid scales, convective or
turbulent, and explicit microphysics, liquid or ice. Simulation of
current climate with those advanced models demonstrate
capability to reproduce realistically many features of the cloud
radiative forcing and its seasonal variations, for both the solar
and terrestrial components.

"Precipitation drives the continental hydrology, and influences the
salinity of the ocean. The distribution of the precipitation in space
and time, is therefore of key importance. The amount of precipi-
tation also constitutes a measure of the latent heat release within
the atmosphere. The long-term global mean precipitation of 984
mm/yr implies a vertically integrated mean heating rate of 78
Wm” (Arkin and Xie, 1994; Kiehl and Trenberth, 1997). The
local precipitation rate on horizontal spatial scales of 1 to 10 km
are 10 to 1,000 times the global number so that the associated
heating rates often dominate all other effects and strongly
influence local and global circulations. Precipitation also acts to
remove and transport aerosols and soluble gases both within and
below clouds, and thus strongly affects the chemical composition
and aerosol distribution. The suspended and precipitating conden-
sates provide sites for aqueous and surface chemical reactions.

"Precipitation is usually considered to be of stratiform or convec-
tive nature, or a mixture of the two. In stratiform precipitation the
vertical velocity of air, usually forced by developing low pressure
systems, monsoonal circulations, or underlying orography, is
comparable to or smaller than the fall speed of snow and ice
crystals. Stratiform precipitation dominates in the extra-tropics
except over continents in summer, and there is substantial spatial
coherency on scales up to and beyond about 100 km. In contrast,
convective precipitation systems are associated with vigorous
latent-heat-driven vertical circulations on horizontal scales of a
few kilometres. Convection is responsible for most of the precip-
itation in the tropics and middle latitude continents in summer. In
many cases, convective and stratiform precipitation interact or
occur together, for instance as convective cells are embedded
within areas of stratiform precipitation.

"Satellite records provide some access to the study of natural
climate fluctuations, such as the seasonal or ENSO cycles, which
can be used to test the ability of the models to represent different
feedbacks. At these time-scales, however, cloud structures are
characterised by large shifts in their latitudinal or longitudinal
position, as well as changes in their vertical distribution in
response to SST changes. Only those latter effects are really
relevant to test climate models in the context of climate change.
Bony et al. (1997) have shown that in the inter-tropical regions,
it was possible to isolate them by looking at the dependence of
cloud properties on SST for specified dynamical regimes. These
regressions are remarkably consistent when carried out with
different sets of independent data (ISCCP, ERBE, TOVS, SSMI)
and offer a constraining test for models. Similar methodologies
are being developed for the mid-latitudes (Tselioudis et al.,
2000). It is encouraging, though, that CCM3 has demonstrated
considerable accuracy in the reproduction of regional all-sky
long-wave and short-wave radiation n budgets (Kiehl etal. 1998).

Over the last 10 years, the generalised availability of satellite
retrievals (OLR, water path, cloud cover, cloud top tempera-
ture) has strongly increased the possibility of assessing clouds
simulated by climate models, in spite of remaining uncertainties
concerning the vertical structure of the cloud systems, of large
importance for all feedback effects. Yet this remains a very
difficult task, which may be illustrated by a few figures.
Recent simulations of equilibrium climate with a doubling of
CO) indicate that the induced variation of net cloud radiative
forcing short-wave or long-wave, ranges within +3 Wm”,
which is a small fraction of the cloud mean long-wave
warming (30 to 35 Wm”) or cloud mean short-wave cooling
(45 to 50 Wm) (Le Treut and McAvaney, 2000; Figure 7.2).
Although most models simulate CRF values within the
uncertainty range of the observed values, the discrepancy in
terms of response to CO, increase is large, both in sign,
amplitude, and share between long-wave and short-wave. This
disagreement (amplified by the water vapour feedback) reflects
the sensitivity of the simulated feedbacks to model formulation
(Watterson et al., 1999; Yao and Del Genio, 1999; Meleshko et
al., 2000) and is the cause of the large spread in model climate
sensitivity (see Figure 7.3; and Chapters 8 and 9). The correct
simulation of the mean distribution of cloud cover and radiative
fluxes is therefore a necessary but by no means sufficient test of
a model’s ability to handle realistically the cloud feedback
processes relevant for climate change.

particularly the clear-sky long-wave transfer, including the

in atmospheric general circulation models relies on several
approximations: the fluxes are computed as averaged quantities
over a few spectral intervals, the propagation is limited to the
vertical upwelling or downwelling directions, and the role of sub-
grid scale features of the clouds or aerosols is essentially
neglected. Although this methodology is believed to have only a
marginal impact on the accuracy of computed long-wave fluxes,

With increasing temperature, the ‘surface energy budget tends to
become increasingly dominated by evaporation, owing to the
increase in the water holding capacity of the boundary layer. The
increase of evaporation is not strictly inevitable (Pierrehumbert,
1999), but it occurs in all general circulation models, though with
varying strength. Simulated evapotranspiration and net
atmospheric moisture content is also found to increase (Del
Genio ef al., 1991; Trenberth, 1998), as is observed to be
happening in many places (Hense ef al., 1988; Gaffen et al.,
1992; Ross and Elliot, 1996; Zhai and Eskridge, 1997). Globally
there must be an increase in precipitation to balance the enhanced
evaporation but the processes by which precipitation is altered
locally are not well understood. Over land, enhanced evaporation
can occur only to the extent that there is sufficient soil moisture
in the unperturbed state. Naturally occurring droughts are likely
to be exacerbated by enhanced potential evapotranspiration,
which quickly robs soil of its moisture.

"similarly enhanced precipitation rates. Moreover, the latent heat
released feeds back on the intensity of the storms. These factors
suggest that, while global precipitation exhibits a small increase
with modest surface warming, it becomes increasingly concen-
trated in intense events, as is observed to be happening in many
parts of the world (Karl et al., 1995), including the USA (Karl
and Knight, 1998), Japan (Iwashima and Yamamoto, 1993) and
Australia (Suppiah and Hennessy, 1998), thus increasing risk of
flooding. However, the overall changes in precipitation must
equal evaporation changes, and this is smaller percentage-wise
than the typical change in moisture content in most model
simulations (e.g., Mitchell et al., 1987; Roads et al., 1996). Thus
there are implications for the frequency of storms or other factors
(duration, efficiency, etc.) that must come into play to restrict the
total precipitation. One possibility is that individual storms could
be more intense from the latent heat enhancement, but are fewer
and farther between (Trenberth, 1998, 1999).

These aspects have been explored only to a limited extent in
climate models. No studies deal with true intensity of rainfall,
which requires hourly (or higher resolution) data, and the
analysis is typically of daily rainfall amounts. Increases in rain
intensity and dry periods are simulated along with a general
decrease in the probability of moderate precipitation events
(Whetton et al., 1993; Cubasch et al., 1995; Gregory and
Mitchell, 1995; Mearns et al., 1995; Jones et al., 1997; Zwiers
and Kharin, 1998; McGuffie et al., 1999). For a given precipita-
tion intensity of 20 to 40 mm/day, the return periods become
shorter by a factor of 2 to 5 (Hennessy et al., 1997). This effect
increases with the strength of the event (Fowler and Hennessy,
1995; Frei et al., 1998). However, estimates of precipitation and
surface long-wave radiation suggest that the sensitivity of the
hydrological cycle in climate models to changes in SST may be
systematically too weak (Soden, 2000). Accordingly, it is
important that much more attention should be devoted to precip-
itation rates and frequency, and the physical processes which
govern these quantities.

In contrast, the simulation of convective precipitation, which
is fully parametrized, is of substantially poorer quality over
continental regions. In a recent intercomparison study that
attempted to simulate dry and wet summers over the continental
US, large inter-model and model-observation differences were
found (Takle et al., 1999), although the larger-scale atmospheric
circulation was prescribed. One specific difficulty is the strong
diurnal cycle of convective precipitation over land, which is
accompanied by the build-up of a well-mixed boundary layer in
response to solar heating prior to the onset of convection. Recent
studies (Yang and Slingo, 1998; Dai et al., 1999) find that moist
convection schemes tend to initiate convection prematurely as
compared with the real world, and instability does not build up
adequately. Premature cloud formation prevents the correct solar
heating from occurring, impacting the development of the well-
mixed boundary layer and continental-scale convergence at the
surface, which in turn affects the triggering of convection. Scale
interactions between convection that is organised by somewhat
larger scales also seem to underlie the difficulties all GCMs have
in simulating the Madden-Julian Oscillation of intra-seasonal
variations in the deep tropics (Slingo et al., 1996).

Solar radiative heating of the stratosphere is mainly from

Model validation is also affected. Many of the data which are
used to tune or validate model parametrizations, such as the
Liquid Water Path (LWP) or the droplet equivalent radius, are
obtained from space measurements by the inversion of radiative
algorithms, which ignore cloud inhomogeneities and anomalous
absorption. This gives a strong importance to satellite instruments

The stratosphere lies immediately above the troposphere, with the
height of the bounding tropopause varying from about 15 km in
the tropics to about 7 km at high latitudes. The mass of the strato-
sphere represents only about 10 to 20% of the total atmospheric
mass, but changes in stratospheric climate are important because
of their effect on stratospheric chemistry, and because they enter
into the climate change detection problem (Randel and Wu, 1999;

data sets from satellite (ERBE) and ground observations

a few tropical sites over a short period of time. The exception
appears to be induced by enhanced absorption due to biomass
burning aerosols (Li, 1998). Limited accuracy of the measure-

The three dimensional nature of the solar radiation diffusion

some role in anomalous absorption. In a recent study using a
Monte-Carlo approach to simulate three-dimensional radiative
transfer, O’Hirok and Gautier (1998a; 1998b) show that cloud
inhomogeneities can increase both the near-infrared gaseous
absorption and cloud droplet absorption in morphologically
complex cloud fields. The enhancement is caused when photons
diffused from cloud edges more easily reach water-rich low levels
of the atmosphere and when photons entering the sides of clouds
become trapped within the cloud cores. The amplitude of those

If anomalous absorption turns out to be real, it is an effect that
will need to be incorporated into radiation schemes. Evaluation of
its importance is hampered by lack of knowledge of a physical
mechanism responsible for the absorption, and hence lack of a
physical basis for any parametrization. Modelling studies by Kiehl
et al. (1995) have demonstrated the sensitivity of the simulated
climate to changes in the atmospheric absorption. As a radiative
forcing, anomalous absorption is fundamentally different from
water vapour or CO) in that it does not significantly alter the
Earth’s net radiation budget. Instead, it shifts some of the deposi-
tion of solar energy from the ground to the atmosphere (Li et al.,
1997), with implications for the hydrological cycle and vertical
temperature profile of the atmosphere. Anomalous absorption
may not, however, appreciably affect climate sensitivity (Cess et
al., 1996).

A comparison of the ARM-ARESE measurements with a
state of the art radiation code, which uses measured atmospheric
quantities as an input, and relies on the same physical assump-
tions as used in climate models, indicated that the anomalous
absorption is larger for cloudy than for clear conditions, and also
tends to be larger for visible rather than for near-infrared fluxes
(Zender et al., 1997). These two characteristics are consistent
with the results of a comparison between the output of the CCM3
general circulation model and observations from Nimbus 7
(Collins, 1998). However, Li et al. (1999) analysed all the data
sets collected during the ARM/ARESE experiment made by
space-borne, air-borne and ground-based instruments and did not
find any significant absorption anomaly. They traced the source
of controversial findings to be associated with inconsistent
measurements made by some air-borne radiometers as used in the
studies of Valero et al. (1997) and Zender et al. (1997) with those
from all other instruments. However, other studies (Cess et al.,
1999; Pope and Valero, 2000; Valero et al., 2000), that do find a
significant absorption anomaly, have further demonstrated that
the ARESE data do indeed satisfy a number of consistency tests
as well as being in agreement with measurements made by other
instruments. Meanwhile, evidence of enhanced cloud absorption
has been found from measurements of the MGO aircraft labora-
tory (Kondratyev ef al., 1998). Inclusion of anomalous absorp-
tion has been found to improve the representation of atmospheric
tides (Braswell and Lindzen, 1998). There finally exists evidence
of an effect associated with clear-sky conditions — in the presence
of aerosols: models tend to overpredict clear-sky diffusion to the
surface (Kato et al., 1997).

The subject of solar effects on climate and weather (see
Section 6.10) has enjoyed a recent resurgence, in part because of
observational studies (Labitzke and van Loon, 1997), but more so
because of modelling studies that suggest viable mechanisms
involving the stratosphere. As solar irradiance changes, propor-
tionally much greater changes are found in the ultraviolet which
leads to photochemically induced ozone changes, and the altered
UV radiation changes the stratospheric heating rates per amount
of ozone present (Haigh, 1996; Shindell et al., 1999a). Including

The dominant wave- .-induced forcing in 1 the stratosphere is
believed to come from tropospherically generated planetary scale
Rossby waves in wintertime. These waves are explicitly resolved
in models and data. Thus the meridional mass circulation,
although two-celled, is predominantly directed towards the
winter pole (e.g., Eluszkiewicz et al., 1996), and leads to a
significant warming and weakening of the polar night vortex
relative to its radiatively determined state (Andrews et al., 1987).
Variability and changes in planetary wave forcing thus lead
directly to variability and changes in wintertime polar tempera-
tures, which modulate chemical ozone loss (WMO, 1999).

Most current atmospheric GCMs do not simulate the QBO and
are therefore incomplete in terms of observed phenomena. It

higher vertical resolution (better than 1 km, Takahashi, 1996;
Horinouchi and Yoden, 1998). It is still not clear what aspects of
vertical resolution, energy dissipation, and wave spectrum are

Enhanced Rayleigh friction improves the results (Manzini and

An ozone loss leads to a reduction in the solar heating, while
the major long-wave radiative effects from the 9.6 and 14 micron
bands (Shine et al., 1995) produce a cooling tendency in the lower
stratosphere and a positive radiative change above (Ramaswamy
et al., 1996; Forster et al., 1997). Large transient loadings of
aerosols in the stratosphere follow volcanic eruptions (IPCC,
1996) which leads to an increase of the heating in the long-wave.
For the solar beam, aerosols enhance the planetary albedo while
the interactions in the near-infrared spectrum yield a heating
which is about one third of the total solar plus long-wave heating
(IPCC, 1996; WMO, 1999). In addition, ozone losses can result
from heterogeneous chemistry occurring on or within sulphate
aerosols, and those changes produce a radiative cooling (Solomon
et al., 1996).

The meridional mass circulation, known as the Brewer-

stratosphere (Andrews et al., 1987). Air entering the stratosphere
in the tropics returns to the troposphere in the extratropics with
a time-scale of about five years (Rosenlof, 1995). Current
models indicate shorter time-scales (Waugh et al., 1997), but the
reasons are not currently well understood. The variation of the
height of the troposphere with latitude is also important for
meridional transport and troposphere-stratosphere exchange.
This is because mid-latitude cross-tropopause mixing is prefer-
entially along isentropic surfaces which are in the troposphere in
the tropics but in the stratosphere at higher latitudes. Transport
processes in the lowermost stratosphere are important factors
affecting tropospheric climate (Pan et al., 1997).

Since the SAR, the assessment of the status sof ocean
processes in climate models has changed in two ways. On the one
hand, advances in model resolution and in the representation of
sub-grid scale processes have led to a somewhat improved
realism in many model simulations. On the other hand, however,
growing evidence for a very high sensitivity of model results to
the representation of certain small-scale processes, in particular
those associated with the THC, has been found. As a
consequence, considerable uncertainties still exist concerning the
extent to which present climate models correctly describe the
oceanic response to changes in the forcing.

Simplified dynamical models, which represent fundamental
aspects of atmospheric circulation, react to external forcing
initially by changes in the recurrence frequency of the patterns
rather than by changes in the patterns themselves (Palmer, 1999).
Therefore, anthropogenically forced climate changes may also be
expressed in an altered pattern frequency. It appears that the
observed northern hemispheric changes can be associated, to
some extent, with a more frequent occurrence of the COWL
pattern (Corti et al., 1999), i.e., the horizontal structure of recent
climate change is correlated with the horizontal pattern of natural
variability.

"There is growing evidence that patterns of atmospheric intra-
seasonal and interannual variability have preferred states (i.e.,
local maxima in the probability density function of atmospheric
variables in phase space) corresponding to circulation regimes.
Using atmospheric data, Corti et al. (1999) showed four distinct
circulation patterns in the wintertime Northern Hemisphere.
These geographical patterns correspond to conventional patterns
of low-frequency atmospheric variability which include the so-
called “Cold Ocean Warm Land” (COWL; Section 7.6) pattern,
the negative Pacific North American pattern, and the so-called
negative Arctic Oscillation pattern.

20 ms“! (Kim, 1996), and alters the amplitude and location of the
planetary-scale wave structure (e.g., Zhou et al., 1996).
Convective precipitation in models is often spuriously locked
onto high topography. Thus the numerical simulation of many
key climatic elements, such as rainfall and cloud cover, strongly
depends upon orography and is strongly sensitive to the
horizontal resolution employed. As such, it is possible that
phenomena of climate variability are sensitive to orographic
effects and their parametrization (Palmer and Mansfield, 1986).
These issues may have potentially important consequences for
the planetary-scale distribution of climate change.

"The ocean influences climate and climate change in various ways.
Ocean currents transport a significant amount of heat, usually
directed poleward and thus contributing to a reduction of the pole-
to-equator temperature gradient; a remarkable exception exists
however in the South Atlantic where heat is transported equator-
ward, i.e. up-gradient, into the North Atlantic. Because of its large
heat capacity, ocean heat storage largely controls the time-scales
of variability to changes in the ocean-atmosphere system,
including the time-scales of adjustment to anthropogenic radiative
forcing. The ocean is coupled to the atmosphere primarily through
the fluxes of heat and fresh water which are strongly tied to the sea
surface temperature (see Section 7.6.1), and also through the
fluxes of radiatively active trace gases such as CO) (see Chapter 3)
which can directly affect the atmospheric radiation balance. All
ocean processes which ultimately can influence these fluxes are
relevant for climate change. Processes in the ocean surface layer
which are associated with seasonal time-scales hence are of
obvious relevance. As the budgets in the surface layer depend on
the exchange with deeper layers in the ocean, it is also necessary
to consider the processes which affect the circulation and water
mass distribution in the deep ocean, in particular when the
response of the climate system at decadal and longer time-scales
is considered. Moreover, processes governing vertical mixing are
important in determining the time-scales on which changes of, for
example, deep ocean temperature and sea level evolve.

In summary, proper parametrization of turbulence in the
surface mixed layer is crucial to correctly simulate air-sea

The overall effect of open ocean convection is usually
parametrized through simple convective-adjustment schemes
(Marotzke, 1991) which have been found to work well (Klinger
et al., 1996). More advanced schemes have a somewhat
increased performance (Paluszkiewicz and Romea, 1997).
Lateral exchange between the deep convective centres and the
surrounding boundary currents can significantly alter the
convective process (Maxworthy, 1997). Within those small
regions, deep mixing is affected by mesoscale eddies in two
ways: cyclonic eddies provide an additional preconditioning
(Legg et al., 1998), and collectively exchange fluid with the
periphery of the deep mixed region. Coarse and medium resolu-
tion ocean models have shown significantly improved simula-
tions of the deep convective regions when more sophisticated
parametrizations of mesoscale eddies were employed
(Danabasoglu and McWilliams, 1995; Visbeck et al., 1997). In
particular the unrealistic widespread convective mixing (>500
m) over much of the Southern Ocean was significantly reduced.

"The heat budget of the mixed layer is determined by
horizontal advection, surface heating, entrainment and the
vertical heat flux at the mixed-layer base. Entrainment occurs
when there is sufficient turbulent energy to deepen the mixed
layer and can result in rapid cooling when accompanied by
upwelling from Ekman pumping. This pumping velocity at the
mixed-layer base results from divergent mixed-layer flow driven
by the wind stress. The shallowing of the mixed layer leads to a
transfer of water from the mixed layer to the interior of the ocean.
The water that passes the deepest mixed-layer depth will not be
re-entrained within a seasonal cycle and is subducted. Large
subduction rates are found where horizontal gradients in mixed
layer depth are large. Thus variations in mixed-layer depth are of
primary importance in setting the structure of the interior of the
ocean. This process can temporarily shield heat anomalies
generated in the mixed layer from the atmosphere. The subduc-
tion process itself is relatively well understood (Spall et al.,
2000), although the role of sub-grid processes in modifying the
subduction process needs further clarification (Hazeleger and
Drijfhout, 2000).

"Deep convective mixing is an essential ingredient of the
THC, in particular in the North Atlantic, and is thus important
for climate problems. It constitutes a very efficient vertical
transfer process, and only a few small regions are needed to
offset the slow diffusive buoyancy gain due to vertical
(diapycnal) mixing (see also Section 7.3.3; e.g., Winton, 1995).
Major sites of known open ocean deep convection are the centre
of the Greenland Sea (Schott et al., 1993; Visbeck et al., 1995),
Labrador Sea (LabSea Group, 1998) and a small region in the
north-western Mediterranean Sea (Schott et al., 1996). However,
only the Labrador Sea is in direct contact with the NADW which
replenishes the deep waters of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian
Oceans. In the Greenland Sea deep and bottom waters remain
local to the Arctic Ocean and deep basins north of Iceland and
have no direct influence on the Denmark Strait Overflow
(Mauritzen, 1996). Deep water formed in the Mediterranean Sea
also never directly outflows through the Strait of Gibraltar.
Dense water also forms on the shelf where convection can reach
to the sea floor producing a well-mixed layer of dense water.
Several mechanisms, such as eddies, flow over canyons and
time-varying shelf break fronts, allow the dense water to enter
into the deep ocean via descending plumes. This ‘shelf convec-
tion’ is believed to be fairly widespread around the Antarctic
continent and is probably the primary mechanism by which
AABW is formed (Orsi et al., 1999). AABW is the densest
bottom water and penetrates into all of the three major oceans.

Diapycnal mixing in the ocean is usually associated with
energy conversions, and parametrizations are often based on
energy arguments. In their most simple form, these suggest
formulating mixing coefficients in terms of stability frequency
and/or Richardson number. Double-diffusive mixing has been
included in a few models only to very a limited extent. The
higher mixing rates found in the abyssal ocean over rough
topography have so far not been included in the vertical mixing

The sensitivity of climate model results to the mixing
parametrization is not fully clear. In a state of thermohaline
equilibrium, the intensity of the meridional overturning circula-
tion should be strongly dependent on the average internal mixing
rate, and in ocean-only models the meridional overturning
circulation often varies with a certain power of the average
mixing rate (Zhang ef al., 1999a). Some models indicate,
however, that significant transports may be involved in wind-
driven flows along isopycnals which outcrop in different
hemispheres. The buoyancy changes are confined to the surface
mixed layers, and little or no interior mixing is required. The
scaling laws and dynamics of such flows have yet to be clarified,
but they do raise the possibility of a meridional heat transport
independent of the interior mixing rate.

Evidence for a significant role for double diffusion in ocean
mixing has emerged. The “salt finger” and “diffusive convec-
tion” processes transfer heat and salt at different rates resulting
in a density transport against its mean gradient. New data
suggest that salt fingers may have a somewhat subtle role over
widespread areas of the sub-tropical gyres (St. Laurent and
Schmitt, 1999). The implications of widespread double diffusion
for the general circulation are, however, controversial. Gargett
and Holloway (1992) found in a model study with a simplistic
representation of double-diffusive mixing that there were
dramatic changes in the circulation and water masses. Recent
studies using a more conservative parametrization of double-
diffusion suggest modest though still significant changes in the
circulation (Zhang et al., 1998).

The processes leading to mixing in the main thermocline
involve random internal wave breaking (Gregg, 1989; Polzin et

Laurent and Schmitt, 1999). Diffusivities in most of the main
thermocline are typically of the order 10 m’s""! or less (Gregg,
1989; Ledwell et al., 1993), whereas diffusivities of an order of
magnitude larger are required to close the THC (Munk, 1966).
Recent observations in the deep ocean have, however, found that
turbulence is greatly enhanced 1,000 to 2,000 m above the bottom
in regions of rough bottom topography (Polzin et al., 1997), with
mixing rates reaching values of 1 to 3 x 10+ m’s""! (Ledwell et

tidal flows over kilometre-scale bathymetric features. In addition
to tidal-driven mixing, the calculations of Munk and Wunsch
(1998) indicate that wind-driven mixing in the Antarctic
Circumpolar Current contributes substantially. Preliminary

Climate models which are based on depth co-ordinates
obtain far too much mixing near a sill. This is caused by both
poor mixing parametrizations in such models and by excessive
diapycnal mixing resulting from the ‘staircase’-like representa-
tion of bottom topography. As a result, water mass structure
downstream of a sill is poorly represented in climate models.
Isopycnic models are free of this erroneous mixing, and addition
of Richardson number dependent mixing to such models results
in realistic tongues of dense water moving downslope, mixing at
a rate consistent with observations (Hallberg, 2000). A
promising new development is the explicit description of the
turbulent bottom boundary layer in climate models which yields
more realistic flow of dense water down slopes (Beckmann and

estimates much better. Aspects of the Southern Hemisphere
circulation are also improved by this parametrization.
Theoretical studies (e.g., Killworth, 1997) suggest somewhat
different formulations based on down-gradient mixing of
potential vorticity. The strengths of isopycnal mixing and eddy-
induced advection are usually described empirically through
coefficients which are constant or dependent on grid size. For

In coarse and medium resolution climate models, the
overflow across the Greenland-Iceland-Scotland ridge has been
found to be highly sensitive to the precise geometry used. For
example, changes in topography by as little as one grid cell
resulted in gross changes not only to the amount of cross-ridge
flux but also to its location, and to the composition of the water
mass actually crossing the sill. Thus, a 50% change in heat flux
at the Greenland-Iceland-Scotland ridge latitude could be
achieved in a model by the addition or subtraction of a single
grid box (Roberts and Wood, 1997). Even eddy-permitting
simulations give flows through sills which are very sensitive to
model details (Willebrand et al., 2001). The physical processes
involve hydraulic control and are not properly represented in
climate models, and it is unclear whether a situation with
substantial overflow changes can be modelled correctly.
Parametrizations for the flux across a sill are only available for
the simplest process models (Killworth, 1994; Pratt and
Chechelnitsky, 1997) that do not include mixing or unsteadi-
ness, both of which are known to be important at sills (Spall and

"The water mass structure in the deep ocean is largely dominated
by the flows across a few shallow sills and through straits. The
role of such flows for climate change arises from their influence
on the THC which in turn can affect surface conditions. Once
water has crossed a sill, it descends the continental slope as a
dense gravity current and provides the water source for the
downstream basin. The water mass properties are determined
by the entrainment of and mixing with ambient water (Baringer
and Price, 1997). For the NADW which is at the heart of the
sinking branch of the global conveyor, the overflow of cold
water across the Greenland-Iceland-Scotland ridge is the
principal source. Observations show intense flow with speeds
up to | m/s, in a layer of less than 100 m thickness above the
bottom and within 20 km of the continental slope. Model
calculations suggest that an interruption of this overflow would
lead to a breakdown of the Atlantic THC and the associated heat
transport within less than a decade (Déscher et al., 1994). In the
past decades the overflow appears to have been fairly steady.
Another prominent feature is the Indonesian Throughflow
which has substantial contributions to the variability of the THC
and heat transport in the Indian Ocean (Godfrey, 1996).

The response of the THC to a perturbation depends on the
relative strength of further feedbacks. Reduced convection and
advective heat transport into a region lead to colder SSTs which
counteracts the effect of salinity on density and thus limits the
strength of the destabilising oceanic feedbacks (Figure 7.4). The
atmospheric heat transport compensates for parts of the changes in
ocean heat transport and is a key factor in determining the stability
of the THC (Zhang et al., 1993; Mikolajewicz and Maier-Reimer,

another feedback (Schiller et al., 1997). Model results suggest that
in the presence of overflow between Greenland and Iceland the
THC is not very sensitive to changes in the atmosphere-ocean

The width and strength of boundary currents in climate
models are very sensitive to resolution, they become stronger and
narrower as the resolution is increased, provided that at the same
time the sub-grid scale transports are also reduced. For example,
a recent simulation for the North Atlantic using a grid resolution
of 1/10° (equivalent to 11 km or better) indicates that features
such as the width, location and variability of boundary currents,
the eddy field and its statistics, as well as regional current features
are in rather good agreement with observations (Smith et al.,

sharp fronts and recirculation regimes and hence miss the associ-

"The horizontal circulation in ocean gyres contributes to the
meridional transports of heat and fresh water in the climate
system (see Section 7.6.2), and therefore is of immediate
relevance for climate change. Much of that transport occurs
through Western Boundary Currents (WBCs) such as the Gulf
Stream, Kuroshio, Agulhas Current and others which are
prominent elements of the ocean circulation. These currents are
mainly driven by the wind, and have a typical width of 50 km.
Once a WBC has left the continental slope, it is characterised by
recirculation regimes and strong mesoscale variability. The
dynamical influence of the WBCs on the less vigorous interior
circulation is not fully understood. Their pathways are, however,
crucial in determining the location of the sub-polar front which
separates the warm waters of the sub-tropics from the colder sub-
polar waters. The lower branch of the THC is also dominated by
deep WBCs. In the Atlantic, these are concentrated within 30 km
of the continental slope, and are accompanied by substantial
recirculation and variability | (Lee et al. 1996).

Model simulations with different climate models have found
a complete shut-down of the THC when the global atmospheric
temperature increases by an amount between 3.7 and 7.4°C
(Manabe and Stouffer, 1993; Stocker and Schmittner, 1997;
Dixon et al., 1999). It is however not clear whether the climate

"system possesses a threshold in this range, as the values depend on
the response of the hydrological cycle to the warming and the
parametrizations of mixing processes in the ocean. Furthermore,
the rate of temperature increase also determines stability: the THC
is less stable under faster perturbations (Stocker and Schmittner,
1997; Stouffer and Manabe, 1999). Model simulations further
suggest that the proximity to the threshold depends on the strength
of the THC: a weaker THC is more likely to shut down completely

"effect of sea ice on the stability of the THC is hampered by the
still crude representation of sea ice in most current climate
models and the resulting unrealistic simulation of sea-ice distri-
butions. A negative feedback contributing to a stabilisation of the
THC was recently proposed by Latif et al. (2000). They
suggested that during El Nifio conditions fresh water export from
the tropical Atlantic via the atmosphere is enhanced; this
tendency is also found in observations (Schmittner er al., 2000).
This implies an increased supply of saltier waters towards the
northern North Atlantic which facilitates deep water formation,
hence a stabilising process for the THC; the opposite effect
occurs for La Nifia conditions.

into sensible and latent (evapotranspiration) heat fluxes whose
release back into the atmosphere directly influences local air
temperature and humidity and thence other climate system
variables. In any given locale, soil moisture availability and
vegetation state largely determine the fraction of net radiation that
is used for evapotranspiration, as well as the photosynthetic and
respiration rates. Thus, realistic modelling of land surface-
atmosphere interactions is essential to realistic prediction of
continental climate and hydrology. In doing this, attention must be
paid to the links between vegetation and the terrestrial energy,
water and carbon cycles, and how these might change due to eco-

In summary, a reduction of the Atlantic THC is a likely
response to increased greenhouse gas forcing based on currently
available model simulations. Uncertainties in the model simula-
tion of the hydrological cycle, the vertical transport of heat in the
ocean interior and the parametrization of deep water formation
processes, however, translate directly to uncertainties regarding
the stability and future evolution of the THC. While none of the
current projections with coupled models exhibit a complete shut-
down of the THC during the next 100 years (see Chapter 9,
Figure 9.21), one cannot exclude the possibility that such thresh-
olds lie in the range of projected climate changes. Furthermore,
since natural variability in the climate system is not fully
predictable, it follows that there are inherent limitations to
predicting transitions and thresholds.

contribute to the reduction of water density in the formation
regions of NADW. However, it is not clear which of these two
processes is the more important (Dixon et al., 1999; Mikolajewicz

reduction in the meridional overturning circulation, a measure of
the THC, from 10 to 50% in response to increasing CO, concen-

"A less likely, but not impossible, scenario is a complete shut-
down of the THC, which would have a dramatic impact on the
climate around the North Atlantic. A complete shut-down requires
the passing of a critical threshold and may be an irreversible
process because of multiple equilibria of the THC. Multiple
equilibria have been reported by the entire ocean and climate
model hierarchy ranging from simple models (Stommel, 1961;
Stocker and Wright, 1991), uncoupled OGCMs (Bryan, 1986;
Marotzke and Willebrand, 1991; Weaver and Hughes, 1994) to
fully coupled ocean-atmosphere GCMs (Manabe and Stouffer,
1988). The structure of the oceanic reorganisation beyond the
threshold, simulated in models of different complexity, is robust:
the Atlantic THC ceases (Manabe and Stouffer, 1993; Schmittner
and Stocker, 1999), which leads to a reduction in the meridional
heat transport in the Atlantic, and hence a regional cooling
counteracts the temperature increase. It depends on the model’s
climate sensitivity whether the combined effect results in a net
warming or net cooling in the regions most affected by the
meridional heat transport of the Atlantic THC. In addition, such
reorganisations would have a profound impact on the north-south
distribution of the warming and precipitation (Schiller et al.,

all the leaf stomatal conductances) determines the vegetation evapotranspiration rate (AE) and net photosynthetic rate (P,.,). On time-scales of
minutes to hours, g, is a direct function of T, q, sl, CO, concentration and soil moisture (W). Increasing CO, concentration can act to signifi-

a few decades must take account of land-surface change for two
main reasons. First, changes in the physical character of the land
surface can affect land-atmosphere exchanges of radiation,
momentum, heat and water (see Figure 7.5 and the simulation
studies discussed below). These effects must be allowed for
within climate simulations or analyses to avoid confusion with
the effects of global warming. Second, changes in vegetation
type, density and associated soil properties usually lead to
changes in terrestrial carbon stocks and fluxes that can then
directly contribute to the evolution of atmospheric CO, concen-

record must estimate these contributions to avoid inaccurate

Other simulation work has indicated that the progressive
cultivation of large areas in the East and Midwest USA over the
last century may have induced a regional cooling of the order of
1 to 2°C due to enhanced evapotranspiration rates and increased
winter albedo (Bonan, 1999). Snow-vegetation albedo effects
significantly influence the near-surface climate; assignment of an
open snow albedo value to the winter boreal forest in an NWP led
to the prediction of air temperatures that were 5 to 10°C too low
over large areas of Canada (Betts et al., 1998). Work has also
been done on the interaction between Sahelian vegetation and
rainfall that suggests that the persistent rainfall anomaly observed
there in the 1970s and 1980s could be related to land-surface
changes (Claussen, 1997; Xue, 1997). All these studies indicate
that large-scale land-use changes can lead to significant regional
climatic impacts. However, it is unlikely that the aggregate of
realistic land-use changes over the next 50 to 100 years will
contribute to global scale climate changes comparable to those
resulting from the warming associated with the continuing

evolution of the soil moisture distribution. There have been
studies of the importance of soil moisture anomalies for episodes
of drought (Atlas and Wolfson, 1993) and flooding (Beljaars et
al., 1996; Giorgi et al., 1996), and the impact of initial soil
moisture conditions on mid-latitude weather (Betts et al., 1996;
Schar et al., 1999). Results from other GCM studies (e.g., Milly
and Dunne, 1994; Bonan, 1996; Ducharne ef al., 1996) and
regional and global water budgets analyses (e.g., Brubaker et al.,
1993; Brubaker and Entekhabi, 1996) have deepened our
appreciation of the importance of land-surface hydrology in the
regional and global energy and water exchanges. In relation to
climate change, such mechanisms are relevant since they might
lead to, or intensify, a reduction in summer soil moisture in mid-
and high latitude semi-arid regions under doubled CO,
conditions (Wetherald and Manabe, 1999). Most of these studies
reported some impact of soil conditions upon land precipitation
during episodes of convective activity, and there is observational
evidence from lagged correlation analysis between soil moisture
conditions and subsequent precipitation over Illinois that this
mechanism is active in mid-latitudes (Findell and Eltahir, 1997).
The formulation of surface runoff and baseflow has been
calculated to have an indirect but strong impact on the surface
energy balance (Koster and Milly, 1997).

There are two major longer term feedbacks between climate
and permafrost: release of greenhouse gases from thawing
permafrost (Goulden et al., 1998; see also Chapter 4, Section 4.2)
and changes in the vegetation associated with the thickening of
the active layer. The first contributes directly to the global
radiative forcing, while the second alters parameters of the
radiation balance and surface hydrology.

"Permafrost, defined as any soil/rock material that remains
frozen throughout two or more consecutive years, underlies
almost 25% of the exposed land surface in the Northern
Hemisphere (Zhang et al., 1999b). The uppermost layer of ground
above permafrost, which experiences seasonal thawing, is called
the active layer. The most distinct feature of land-atmosphere
interactions in permafrost regions is that mass exchange is usually
limited to this relatively shallow active layer, with complex
transfers of heat by conduction and percolation across the
ice/water interface. Recent modelling studies indicate that by the
middle of the 21st century, climatic warming may result in a 12 to
15% reduction of the near-surface permafrost area and a 15 to
30% increase of the active layer thickness (Anisimov and Nelson,
1996, 1997; Anisimov er al., 1997). Because of the latent heat
involved, thawing of ice-rich permafrost under the changing
climatic conditions will be slow, while the reaction of the active
layer will be very fast.

decaying sea-ice cover, mottled with melt ponds and interrupted
by frequent openings in July. The seasonal changes in mean
albedo in the central Arctic, from roughly 0.8 in May to 0.5 in
mid-August, are known to within about + 0.06 to 0.08. The mean
spatial pattern in each summer month features lower albedos in
the central Arctic and values 0.1 to 0.2 higher along the ice
margins, but the spatial evolution of the pattern in any given year
is variable. Averages observed at Soviet North Pole drifting
stations, from 1950 to 1991, tend to be higher than satellite-based
estimates (Marshunova and Mishin, 1994). Albedo depends on
wavelength of radiation and on type and thickness of ice;
however, ice type and thickness become unimportant if the snow
cover exceeds 3 cm water equivalent. The representation of sea-
ice albedo in AGCMs may take account of fractional snow cover,
specified or predicted sea-ice thickness, ice surface temperature
and the fraction of openings and puddles (Barry, 1996). Most
models treat visible and near-infrared spectral ranges but there is
still a wide variety of snow and ice albedo parametrizations
among atmospheric and ocean GCMs. Important new data sets
on puddle albedos (Morassutti and LeDrew, 1996) and the

"Since the SAR, several coupled climate models have incorpo-
rated an explicit treatment of openings in sea ice, often in conjunc-
tion with ice dynamics. This is typically effected by partitioning a
model grid cell into ice-free and ice-covered fractions. However,
sub-grid scale variability in ice thickness, not represented in these
schemes, can have a potentially important influence on sea-ice
mass balance (Schramm et al., 1997), ice/ocean fluxes of heat and
fresh water (Holland et al., 1997b) and the sensitivity of sea ice to
thermodynamic perturbations (Holland and Curry, 1999). Recent
advances in modelling the thickness distribution function make
representing sub-grid scale variability, and the accompanying
effects, feasible in global climate simulations (Bitz er al., 2001).
Other developments since the SAR include updated parametriza-
tions of snow ageing and associated albedo changes and the
implementation in some models of a multi-layer formulation of
heat conduction through the ice. Snow plays a particularly
important role in sea-ice thermodynamics by modifying the
surface albedo, reducing thermal conductivity (and hence ice
growth rates), and in some locations causing submergence and
surface flooding of ice. Considerable effort continues to be
devoted to the development and testing of improved physically
based parametrizations suitable for use in such models. Recent
field experiments, most notably SHEBA (Randall et al., 1998;
Perovich et al., 1999), have provided observational data particu-
larly suited to evaluating climate model parametrizations of sea-
ice thermodynamic processes and initial attempts at this are
underway. Although sea-ice thermodynamic processes are crudely
approximated in many coupled climate models (see Chapter 8,

Observations of sea-ice extent and concentration (the fraction of local area covered by ice) are based primarily on satellite data
available since the late 1970s. Sea-ice thickness is also important in assessing possible changes in the amount of sea ice;
however, thickness observations are more difficult to make. For the Arctic, thickness data come primarily from sonar measure-
ments from submarines and a few oceanographic moorings. Although limited, the observations indicate statistically significant
decreases in ice extent and thickness over the past few decades, with Arctic sea-ice extent declining at a rate of about 3% per
decade since the late 1970s. Sea-ice retreat in the Arctic spring and summer over the last few decades is consistent with an
increase in spring temperature, and to a lesser extent, summer temperatures at high latitudes. Thickness data show a near 40%
decrease in the summer minimum thickness of Arctic sea ice over approximately the last 30 years. Estimates using independent
methods for the winter, but over a much shorter period, also suggest thickness reductions, but at a markedly slower rate.
However, due to limited sampling, uncertainties are difficult to estimate, and the influence of decadal to multi-decadal

Sea ice is particularly difficult to simulate in climate models because it is influenced directly by both the atmosphere (temper-
ature, radiation, wind) and the ocean (heat transport and mixing, and surface currents), and because many of the relevant
processes require high grid resolution or must be parametrized. Recent coupled climate models include a sea-ice component
that incorporates openings in the ice, often in conjunction with ice dynamics (motion and deformation). Furthermore, updated
parametrizations of snow ageing and associated albedo changes and multi-layer formulations of heat conduction through the ice
and overlying snow cover are being implemented in some models. Although many thermodynamic processes are crudely
approximated, it is unclear how these approximations contribute to errors in climate model simulations. Sea-ice dynamics is
important in determining local ice thickness and export of sea ice from the formation areas, but despite the rather mature status
of physically based sea-ice dynamics models, only a few of the current coupled climate models include such a component.
Coupled model simulations of the seasonal cycle of sea-ice coverage in both hemispheres exhibit large deviations from the

Sea ice in the Arctic and around Antarctica responds directly to climate change and may, if properly monitored, become increas-
ingly important for detecting climate change. Although sea ice covers only about 5% of the Earth’s surface, its extent and
thickness have important influences in the coupled atmosphere-ocean system. Increasing the understanding of these processes
and representing them more realistically in climate models is important for making more reliable climate change projections.
Several processes associated with sea ice are climatically relevant. The sea-ice albedo effect is an important contributor to the
amplification of projected warming at high latitudes. Albedo decreases if the extent of sea ice is reduced and more ocean surface
is exposed, resulting in increased heat absorption and hence warming. Melting of snow and the formation of melt-water ponds
also reduces albedo and alters the radiation balance. Changes in sea-ice thickness and lead (open water) fraction modify the heat
transfer from the ocean: thinner sea ice and more leads result in enhanced heat loss from the exposed ocean thus further
warming the atmosphere. Changes in cloud cover may influence how large this effect really is. A principal mechanism for dense
water formation in the ocean around Antarctica and in shelf regions of the Arctic is the rejection of brine as sea water freezes.
Changes in sea-ice formation alter the properties and formation rates of ocean deep water and therefore have an influence on
the water mass structure that reaches far beyond the area of sea ice. Finally, ice export from the Arctic represents an important
southward flux of fresh water which influences the density structure of the upper ocean in the Nordic, Labrador and Irminger
Seas.

The high latitude ocean fresh water budget is dominated by
cryospheric processes. These include growth, melt and transport
of sea ice, glacial melt, snowfall directly on ice and its subsequent
melt and the runoff of snow melt water from adjacent land.
Decadal-scale oscillations in atmospheric circulation may result in
changes of the distribution of precipitation over watersheds that
empty into the Arctic Ocean as well as of the snow cover on sea
ice itself. The various components of the Arctic fresh water budget
are reviewed in detail in Lewis (2000). Fresh water transport by
sea ice is becoming increasingly important in coupled climate

explicit representation of this type of redistribution of the fresh
water entering the ocean’s surface.

Atlantic amounts to an annual loss of roughly 0.4 m of fresh

salt released by this ice growth is in turn largely offset by inflow
of fresher Pacific water, via the Bering Strait, and river runoff,
maintaining a stable stratification. Changes in ice outflow, such
as might arise under a changing climate, could alter the distribu-

"Ice sheets are continental scale masses of fresh water ice
formed by the burial and densification of snow. They can be
divided into areas that are grounded on the land surface, either
below or above sea level, and areas that are afloat. Grounded
parts of ice sheets exhibit slow and fast modes of flow. The slow
sheet-flowing component is the more prevalent but the fast
stream-flowing component can account for most of the ice
discharge. Switching between slow and fast modes of flow may
occur thermally, mechanically or hydrologically and is sugges-
tive of “surging”, a known cyclic instability of certain glaciers
(Kamb et al., 1985; Bindschadler, 1997). The slow-flow process
for ice sheets is internal creep and the fast-flow processes relevant
to ice streams are bottom sliding, enhanced creep and sub-glacial
sediment deformation (Alley, 1989; Iken et al., 1993; Engelhardt
and Kamb, 1998). The factors controlling onset, discharge and
width of ice streams are subject to poorly understood geological,
topographic, thermal and hydrological controls (Clarke and

In the residual method the atmospheric energy transport is
subtracted from the top-of-the-atmosphere radiation budget to
derive the ocean heat transport. Until fairly recently, the
atmospheric poleward transport estimates were too small and led
to overestimates of the ocean transports. This has improved with
local applications of global numerical atmospheric analyses
based on four dimensional data assimilation (Trenberth and
Solomon, 1994; Keith, 1995). With reanalysis of atmospheric
observations, more reliable atmospheric transports are becoming
available (Table 7.1). Sun and Trenberth (1998) show that large
interannual changes in poleward ocean heat transports are
inferred with El Nifio events in the Pacific. The moisture budget
estimates of E-P are generally superior to those computed
directly from E and P estimates from the model used in the
assimilation (e.g., Trenberth and Guillemot, 1998) and are
probably to be preferred to bulk flux estimates, given the inaccu-

Floating margins of ice sheets are called ice shelves, the
largest of which are found in West Antarctica and mediate the
transfer of ice between fast-flowing ice streams and the Southern

shelves, either associated with ice stream instability or
independent of it, cannot be discounted and would be consider-
ably more probable than complete disintegration of the West
Antarctic ice sheet (Bentley, 1998; see also Chapter 11, Section
11.3.3). Such an event would be accompanied by a large increase
in iceberg flux to the Southern Ocean and uncertain effects on the
production of AABW and ocean circulation. Different ice shelf
models compare well (MacAyeal et al., 1996); however, the
stability of grounding lines remains an issue and could signifi-

unstable (Thomas and Bentley, 1978) is not supported by more

consistent with the simulated ocean heat and fresh water

The latest results of the zonal mean ocean heat transports
computed from (i) observational data as residuals, (ii) models run
without flux adjustments and (iii) direct measurements agree
within error estimates (Table 7.1). This suggests that the models
are now converging on the correct values for the zonally averaged
heat fluxes. However, significant regional biases and compen-
sating errors in the radiative and turbulent fluxes still exist
(Doney et al., 1998; Gordon et al., 2000). The coupled model
fresh water flux estimates are more problematic. For example, the
inter-tropical convergence zone may become skewed and
spuriously migrate from one hemisphere to the other, seriously
distorting the precipitation fields (e.g., Boville and Gent, 1998).

The compatibility and improvements of the ocean and
atmospheric heat transports in models is evidently the primary
reason why coupled runs can now be made without flux adjust-
ments (Gregory and Mitchell, 1997). This is due to a better
representation of key processes in both atmosphere and ocean
components of climate models, and improved spatial resolution.
These key processes include, in the atmosphere, convection,
boundary-layer physics, clouds, and surface latent heat fluxes
(Hack, 1998), and in the ocean, boundary layer and mesoscale
eddy mixing processes (Doney ef al., 1998; Large and Gent,

observations (deviations of less than 2°C), there are large areas
where consistent errors of SST occur in the models (e.g., too cold
in the North Pacific; too warm in coastal upwelling regions, see

While it deals with ocean circulation and the mechanisms of
ocean heat transport, estimates could only be made at a few
locations where high quality observations were available and
assumptions, such as geostrophic velocity estimates, are reason-
able. Most of the recent estimates are for the Atlantic Ocean (see
Table 7.1), for which there is general agreement that there is
northward ocean heat transport at all latitudes. It is generally
understood that this northward heat transport is associated with
the THC in which NADW is formed in the polar and sub-polar
North Atlantic and subsequently flows southward as a deep
western boundary current into the Southern Ocean. In the North
Pacific Ocean at 10°N (Wijffels et al., 1996), the northward heat
flux of 0.7 + 0.5 PW (1 PetaWatt = 1 PW = 10!5 W) is due
primarily to a shallow Ekman upper thermocline cell. It is
estimated that a 6 Sv change in Ekman transport, which is
comparable to the differences among existing climatologies,
would cause a 0.4 PW change in meridional heat transport. For
the South Pacific (Koshlyakov and Sazhina, 1996; Tsimplis et al.,
1998) and Indian oceans (Robbins and Toole, 1997) the determi-
nation of ocean heat transport is hampered by uncertainties in the
size of the Indonesian Throughflow and in the Agulhas Current
transports (Beal and Bryden, 1997), and the estimates of
northward heat transport across 30°S in the Indian Ocean range
from —0.4 to -1.3 PW (Robbins and Toole, 1997; Macdonald,
1998). Macdonald (1998) and Macdonald and Wunsch (1996)
have made a global inverse analysis of selected high quality
hydrographic sections covering all ocean basins taken prior to the
World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) observational

heat fluxes, results from the methods are beginning to converge.

Some teleconnections arise simply from natural preferred

changes (Trenberth et al., 1998). The most prominent are the
Pacific-North American (PNA) and the North Atlantic Oscillation

account for a substantial part of the pattern of northern

Atlantic atmospheric variations from observed SSTs but with
much reduced amplitude. Bretherton and Battisti (2000)

"The weather and climate around the world in one place is
generally strongly linked to that in other places through
atmospheric linkages. In the tropics and sub-tropics, large-scale
overturning in the atmosphere, which is manifested as the
seasonal monsoon variations, links the wet summer monsoons to
the dry subsiding regions usually in the tropics and sub-tropics of
the winter hemisphere. Throughout the world, teleconnections
link neighbouring regions mainly through large-scale, quasi-
stationary atmospheric Rossby waves. A direct consequence of
these linkages is that some regions are wetter and/or hotter than
the prevailing global scale changes, while half a wavelength away
the regions may be dryer and/or cooler than the global pattern.
Moreover, because of the way these patterns set up relative to
land and ocean, they can alter the global mean changes. In
addition, errors in models (such as in convection in the tropical
Pacific) can be manifested non-locally through teleconnections,
e.g., in the North Pacific SSTs (see Figure 8.1a), although other
processes are also involved.

"The term “monsoon” is now generally applied to tropical
and sub-tropical seasonal reversals in both the atmospheric
circulation and associated precipitation. These changes arise
from reversals in temperature gradients between continental
regions and the adjacent oceans with the progression of the
seasons. The dominant monsoon systems in the world are the
Asian-Australian, African and the American monsoons. As land
heats faster than ocean in summer, heated air rises and draws
moist low-level maritime air inland where convection and release
of latent heat fuel the monsoon circulation. For the Asian
monsoon, a regional meridional temperature gradient extending
from the tropical Indian Ocean north to mid-latitude Asia
develops prior to the monsoon through a considerable depth of
the troposphere (Webster ef al., 1998). To a first order, the
stronger this meridional temperature gradient, the stronger the
monsoon. Thus land-surface processes, such as soil moisture and
snow cover in Asia can influence the monsoon and, along with
SST variations, may induce quasi-biennial variability (Meehl,
1997). Additionally, large-scale forcing associated with tropical
Pacific SSTs influences monsoon strength through the large-scale
east-west overturning in the atmosphere. Anomalously cold
(warm) Pacific SSTs often are associated with a strong (weak)
monsoon, though these connections are somewhat intermittent.

"There is no clear separation between the wind-driven circula-
tion and the THC (see Section 7.3.6) because they interact with
each other on several time-scales. While there is a great deal of
empirical evidence that the ocean and sea surface temperatures
co-vary with the atmosphere, this may only indicate that the
atmosphere forces the ocean, and it does not necessarily signify
a feedback or a truly coupled process that contributes to the
variability. Moreover, it is very difficult to establish such
coupling from observational studies. This topic was not dealt
with thoroughly by the SAR. In the tropics there is clear
evidence of the ocean forcing the atmosphere, such as in El
Nifio (see Section 7.6.5). In the extra-tropics much of what can
be seen is accountable through fairly random wind variations;
essentially stochastic forcing of the ocean is converted into low
frequency ocean variability and gives a red spectrum in oceanic
temperatures and currents up to the decadal time-scale
(Hasselmann, 1976; Hall and Manabe, 1997). Feedback to the
atmosphere is not involved. In the spatial resonance concept
(Frankignoul and Reynolds, 1983) there is still no feedback
from the ocean to the atmosphere, but oceanic quantities may
exhibit a spectral peak through an advective time-scale
(Saravanan and McWilliams, 1998) or Rossby wave dynamics
time-scale (Weng and Neelin, 1998). In coupled air-sea modes,
such as those proposed by Latif and Barnett (1996) for the
North Pacific and by Groetzner et al. (1998) for the North
Atlantic, there is a feedback from the ocean to the atmosphere.
Spectral peaks are found in both the ocean and the atmosphere,
and the period of the oscillation is basically determined by the
adjustment time of the sub-tropical gyre to changes in the wind
stress curl.

Watanabe and Nitta (1999) have suggested that high latitude
snow cover on land is responsible for decadal changes in the
NAO. Changes in sea-ice cover in both the Labrador and
Greenland Seas as well as over the Arctic also appear to be well
correlated with the NAO (Deser et al., 2000). Such changes may
also affect the atmosphere because of the large changes in

Dominant large-scale patterns of ocean-atmosphere
interactions are also found in the tropical Indian Ocean (Saji et

similar to El Nifio and are associated with large east-west SST
changes and a switch of the major tropical convection areas
from Africa to Indonesia. There are indications that this
atmosphere-ocean process is somewhat independent of ENSO
and represents a natural mode of the tropical Indian Ocean.

In the Atlantic, an important emerging coupled mode of
variability is the so-called tropical Atlantic dipole, which
involves variations of opposite sign in the sea level pressure
field across the equatorial Atlantic and corresponding variations
in the ITCZ location. Given the background SST and wind
fields, anomalous SSTs of opposite sign across the equatorial
region are apt to alter the surface winds in such a way as to
enhance or reduce evaporative cooling of the ocean and
reinforce the original SST pattern (Carton et al., 1996; Chang et
al., 1997). The ocean provides a decadal time-scale to the
coupled interactions.

The vital processes for improved monsoon simulation in
models are those associated with the hydrological cycle,
especially in the tropics. These include convection, precipita-

as land surface processes (see Section 7.4), and interactions of
the atmosphere with complex topography and with the ocean.
The difficulties in assembling all of these elements together
has led to problems in simulating mean precipitation as well as
interannual monsoon variability, although improvements are

atmosphere alone, the PNA is also influenced by changes in
ENSO (see Section 7.6.5). Thompson and Wallace (1998, 2000)
suggest that the NAO may be the regional manifestation of an
annular (zonally symmetric) hemispheric mode of variability
characterised by a seesaw of atmospheric mass between the
polar cap and the middle latitudes in both the Atlantic and
Pacific Ocean basins and they call this the Arctic Oscillation
(AO). A similar, even more zonal structure is dominant in the
Southern Hemisphere (Trenberth er al., 1998) (the Southern
Annular Mode, sometimes called the Antarctic Oscillation,
AAO). The vertical structure of both AO and AAO extends well
into the stratosphere (Perlwitz and Graf, 1995; Thompson and

"The NAO is the dominant pattern of wintertime atmospheric
circulation variability over the extra-tropical North Atlantic
(Hurrell, 1995), and has exhibited decadal variability and trends
(see Chapter 2, Section 2.6). There is strong evidence indicating
that much atmospheric circulation variability in the form of the
NAO arises from internal atmospheric processes (Saravanan,
1998; Osborn et al., 1999). During winters when the stratospheric
vortex is stronger than normal, the NAO (and AO) tends to be in
a positive phase suggesting an interaction and perhaps even a
downward influence from the stratosphere to the troposphere (see
Sections 7.2.5 and 7.6.3; Baldwin and Dunkerton, 1999). The
recent trend in the NAO/AO could possibly thus be related to
processes which are known to affect the strength of the strato-
spheric polar vortex such as tropical volcanic eruptions (Kodera,

greenhouse gas concentrations resulting from anthropogenic

"It has long been recognised that fluctuations in SST are
related to the strength of the NAO, and Dickson et al. (1996,
2000) have shown a link to the ocean gyre and thermohaline
circulations. The leading mode of SST variability over the North
Atlantic during winter is associated with the NAO. During high
NAO years anomalous SSTs form a tri-polar pattern with a cold
anomaly in the sub-polar region, a warm anomaly in the middle
latitudes, and a cold sub-tropical anomaly (e.g., Deser and
Blackmon, 1993), consistent with the spatial form of the
anomalous surface fluxes associated with the NAO pattern
(Cayan, 1992). This indicates that SST is responding to
atmospheric forcing on seasonal time-scales (Deser and Timlin,
1997). However, GCM simulations suggest that SST in the North
Atlantic can, in turn, have a marked effect on NAO (see Section
7.6.2). Winter SST anomalies were observed to spread eastward
along the path of the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Current
with a transit time-scale of a decade (Sutton and Allen, 1997).
These SST anomalies reflect anomalies in the heat content of the
deep winter mixed layers that when exposed to the atmosphere in
winter (Alexander and Deser, 1995) could affect the NAO,
imprinting the advective time-scale of the gyre on the atmosphere
(McCartney et al., 1996). Moreover, similar processes were
identified in coupled GCM integrations (Groetzner et al., 1998;
Timmermann ef al., 1998; Delworth and Mann, 2000) where
changes in SST due to oceanic processes (gyre advection or
thermohaline circulation) affected the NAO. This, in turn, leads
to changes in heat and fresh water fluxes, and in wind stress
forcing of the oceanic circulation. Oceanic response to such
changes in the forcing produced a negative feedback loop,
leading to decadal oscillations. However, the role of these
mechanisms i is yet to be established.

Therefore, climate change may manifest itself both as shifting means as well as changing preference of specific regimes, as
evidenced by the observed trend toward positive values for the last 30 years in the NAO index and the climate “shift” in the tropical
Pacific about 1976. While coupled models simulate features of observed natural climate variability such as the NAO and ENSO,
suggesting that many of the relevant processes are included in the models, further progress is needed to depict these natural modes

abrupt changes, there has been an increase in uncertainty in those aspects of climate change that critically depend on regional

"Observed changes in climate over the Northern Hemisphere in winter reveal large warming over the main continental areas and
cooling over the North Pacific and North Atlantic. This “cold ocean — warm land” pattern has been shown to be linked to changes
in the atmospheric circulation, and, in particular, to the tendency in the past few decades for the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)
to be in its positive phase. Similarly, the Pacific-North American (PNA) teleconnection pattern has been in a positive phase in
association with a negative Southern Oscillation index or, equivalently, the tendency for El Nifio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) to
prefer the warm El Nifio phase following the 1976 climate shift (Chapter 2). Because of the differing heat capacities of land and
ocean, the “cold ocean-warm land” pattern has amplified the Northern Hemisphere warming. A fingerprint of global warming from
climate models run with increasing greenhouse gases indicates greater temperature increases over land than over the oceans, mainly
from thermodynamic (heat capacity and moisture) effects. This anthropogenic signal is therefore very similar to that observed,
although an in-depth analysis of the processes involved shows that the dynamical effects from atmospheric circulation changes are
also important. In other words, the detection of the anthropogenic signal is potentially masked or modified by the nature of the
observed circulation changes, at least in the northern winter season. The detection question can be better resolved if other seasons
are also analysed (Chapter 12). Attribution of the cause of the observed changes requires improved understanding of the origin of
the changes in atmospheric circulation. In particular, are the observed changes in ENSO and the NAO (and other modes) perhaps
a consequence of global warming itself?

"There is no simple answer to this question at present. Because the natural response of the atmosphere to warming (or indeed
to any forcing) is to change large-scale waves, some regions will warm while others cool more than the hemispheric average, and
counterintuitive changes can be experienced locally. Indeed, there are preferred modes of behaviour of the atmospheric circulation,
sometimes manifested as preferred teleconnection patterns (see this chapter) that arise from the planetary waves in the atmosphere
and the distribution of land, high topography, and ocean. Often these modes are demonstrably natural modes of either the
atmosphere alone or the coupled atmosphere-ocean system. As such, it is also natural for modest changes in atmospheric forcing
to project onto changes in these modes, through changes in their frequency and preferred sign, and the evidence suggests that
changes can occur fairly abruptly. This is consistent with known behaviour of non-linear systems, where a slow change in forcing
or internal mechanisms may not evoke much change in behaviour until some threshold is crossed at which time an abrupt switch
occurs. The best known example is the evidence for a series of abrupt climate changes in the palaeoclimate record apparently partly
in response to slow changes in sea level and the orbit of the Earth around the Sun (Milankovitch changes, see Chapter 2). There is
increasing evidence that the observed changes in the NAO may well be, at least in part, a response of the system to observed
changes in sea surface temperatures, and there are some indications that the warming of tropical oceans is a key part of this (see
this chapter for more detail). ENSO is not simulated well enough in global climate models to have confidence in projected changes
with global warming (Chapter 8). It is likely that changes in ENSO will occur, but their nature, how large and rapid they will be,
and their implications for regional climate change around the world are quite uncertain and vary from model to model (see this
chapter and Chapter 9). On time-scales of centuries, the continuing increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may cause the
climate system to cross a threshold associated with the Atlantic thermohaline circulation: beyond this threshold a permanent shut-
down of the thermohaline circulation results (see this chapter and Chapter 9).

"Indices of ENSO for the past 120 years (Figure 7.9), indicate
that there is considerable variability in the ENSO cycle in the
modern record. This variability has been variously attributed to:
(i) stochastic forcing due to weather and other high-frequency
“noise”, and the Madden-Julian intra-seasonal oscillation in
particular; (ii) deterministic chaos arising from internal non-
linearities of the tropical Pacific ENSO system; (iii) forcing
within the climate system but external to the tropical Pacific, and
(iv) changes in exogenous forcing (see Neelin ef al., 1998 and
references therein). Palaeo-proxies, archaeological evidence, and
instrumental data (see Chapter 2) all indicate variations in ENSO
behaviour over the past centuries, and throughout the Holocene.
Much of this variability appears to be internal to the Earth’s
climate system, but there is evidence that the rather weak forcing
due to orbital variations may be responsible for a systematic
change to weaker ENSO cycles in the mid-Holocene (Sandweiss
et al., 1996; Clement et al., 1999; Rodbell et al., 1999). However,
it appears that the character of ENSO can change on a much
faster time-scale than that of small amplitude insolation change
imposed by the Earth’s varying orbit. The inference to be drawn
from observed ENSO variability is that small forcings are able to
cause large alterations in the behaviour of this non-linear system.

"ENSO is generated by ocean-atmosphere interactions internal to
the tropical Pacific and overlying atmosphere. Positive tempera-
ture anomalies in the eastern equatorial Pacific (characteristic of
an El Nifio event) reduce the normally large sea surface temper-
ature difference across the tropical Pacific. As a consequence, the
trade winds weaken, the Southern Oscillation index (defined as
the sea level pressure difference between Tahiti and Darwin)
becomes anomalously negative, and sea level falls in the west and
rises in the east by as much as 25 cm as warm waters extend
eastward along the equator. At the same time, these weakened
trades reduce the upwelling of cold water in the eastern equato-
rial Pacific, thereby strengthening the initial positive temperature
anomaly. The weakened trades also cause negative off-equatorial
thermocline depth anomalies in the central and western Pacific.
These anomalies propagate westward to Indonesia, where they
are reflected and propagate eastward along the equator. Thus
some time after their generation, these negative anomalies cause
the temperature anomaly in the east to decrease and change sign.
The combination of the tropical air-sea instability and the delayed
negative feedback due to sub-surface ocean dynamics can give
rise to oscillations (for a summary of theories see Neelin et al.,
1998). Two of these feedbacks are schematically illustrated in
Figure 7.8. Beyond influencing tropical climate, ENSO seems to
have a global influence: during and following El Nijio, the global
mean surface temperature increases as the ocean transfers heat to
the atmosphere (Sun and Trenberth, 1998).

Model studies have ‘shown that greenhouse gas forcing is
likely to change the statistics of ENSO variability, but the
character of the change is model dependent. A comprehensive
simulation suggests that greenhouse warming may induce greater
ENSO activity marked by larger interannual variations relative to
the warmer mean state (Timmermann er al., 1999). More El
Nifios would increase the probability of certain weather regimes
which favour COWL patterns associated with increased
hemispheric mean surface temperatures (Hurrell, 1996; Corti et
al., 1999). The positive feedbacks involved in ENSO imply that
small errors in simulating the relevant processes can be
amplified. Yet increasing evidence suggests that ENSO plays a
fundamental role in global climate and its interannual variability,
and increased credibility in both regional and global climate

 
"	Text
"In the tropics, it has been difficult for models to simulate all
of the important processes correctly, and errors exist in the mean
state of the tropical Pacific and the variability (see Chapter 8,
Section 8.7.1). It is unlikely that it is possible to simulate the
mean annual cycle correctly without simulating realistic ENSO
events, as ENSO alters the mean state through rectification
effects. For example, it is known that some regions only receive
rainfall during an El Nifio event. Hence it would be impossible to
simulate correct rainfall in these regions without also simulating
El Nifio. Moreover, ENSO events are phase-locked to the annual
cycle and changes in the mean state alter ENSO variability. In the
Zebiak and Cane (1991) model the tropical east Pacific SST is
systematically cooler during the “weak ENSO” regime than
during the “strong ENSO” regime. Cloud radiative forcing
feedbacks, such as the interactions between stratus regimes and
ocean temperature, are poorly simulated, and the greenhouse
effects of clouds versus their possible brightening with climate
change are very uncertain.

Any changes in ENSO as the climate changes will impact the
distribution and tracks of tropical cyclones (including intense
storms such as hurricanes and typhoons). During an El Nijfio, for
example, the incidence of hurricanes typically decreases in the
Atlantic and far western Pacific and Australian regions, but
increases in the central and eastern Pacific (Lander, 1994). Thus
it should be recognised that decreases in one area may be offset
by increases in another area because of the global connectivity of
the tropical atmospheric circulation. Global warming from
increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere suggests
increased convective activity but there is a possible trade-off
between individual versus organised convection. While increases
in sea surface temperatures favour more and stronger tropical
cyclones, increased isolated convection stabilises the tropical
troposphere and this in turn suppresses organised convection
making it less favourable for vigorous tropical cyclones to
develop (Yoshimura ef al., 1999). Thus changes in atmospheric
stability (Bengtsson et al., 1996) and circulation may produce
offsetting tendencies (e.g., Royer et al., 1998). General circula-
tion models of the atmosphere (see Chapter 8, Section 8.8.4) do
not resolve the scales required to properly address this issue; for
instance, moist convection and hurricanes are not resolved
adequately.

Here, we briefly summarise non-linear changes that have
captured attention in the recent literature and that have been
assessed in this chapter:
"	Text
"¢ Results from most climate models suggest that the Atlantic
thermohaline circulation slows down in response to global
warming; some models simulate a complete shut-down if
certain thresholds are passed (see Section 7.3.6 and Chapter 9,
"	List
"cases no longer be valid. Non-linearity is a prerequisite for the
existence of thresholds in the climate system: small perturbations
or changes in the forcing can trigger large reorganisations if
thresholds are passed. The result is that atmospheric and oceanic
circulations may change from one regime to another. This could
possibly b be: manifested as rapid climate change.

"Comprehensive climate models in conjunction with
sustained observational systems, both in situ and remote, are the
only tool to decide whether the evolving climate system is
approaching such thresholds. Our knowledge about the
processes, and feedback mechanisms determining them, must be
significantly improved in order to extract early signs of such
changes from model simulations and observations.

 
"	Text
"Section 9.3.4.3). Such a shut-down is in general not abrupt but
evolves on a time-scale which is determined by the warming,
i.e., a few decades to centuries. Processes for such an evolution
are increasingly understood. As model resolution increases and
high latitude processes are better represented in these models
(sea ice, topography), additional feedbacks influencing the
Atlantic THC will be investigated and their relative importance
must be explored. This will lead to a better quantification of the
overall stability of the THC.
"	Text
"¢ The Northern Hemispheric atmospheric circulation exhibits
different regimes that are associated with the North Atlantic
Oscillation. Recent analyses of observations suggest that
relatively rapid regime changes are possible (see Section 7.2.6)
and that they may have happened frequently in the past
(Appenzeller et al., 1998). Several studies suggest that the
recent changes may be a response to anthropogenic forcing, but
our understanding of the processes generating NAO is not
sufficient to have confidence in whether this is the case.
"	List
"Reducing uncertainty in climate projections also requires a
better understanding of these non-linear processes which give
rise to thresholds that are present in the climate system.
Observations, palaeoclimatic data, and models suggest that such
thresholds exist and that transitions have occurred in the past. The
occurrence of such transitions can clearly not be excluded in a
climate that is changing. On the contrary, model simulations
indicate that such transitions lie within the range of changes that
are projected for the next few centuries if greenhouse gas concen-
trations continue to increase. A particular concern is the fact that
some of these changes may even be irreversible due to the
existence of multiple equilibrium states in the climate system.

There is no clear definition of “rapid climate change”. In
general, this notion is used to describe climate changes that are of
significant magnitude (relative to the natural variability) and
occur as a shift in the mean or variability from one level to
another. In order to distinguish such changes from “extreme
events”, a certain persistence of the change is required. Among
the classical cases are spontaneous transitions from one preferred
mode to another or transitions triggered by slowly varying
forcing. This occurs in non-linear systems which have multiple
equilibria (Lorenz, 1993). Evidence for the possibility of such
transitions can be found in palaeoclimatic records (see Chapter 2,
Section 2.4; and Stocker, 2000), in observations of changes in
large-scale circulation patterns from the instrumental record (see
Section 7.6.5.1), and contemporary observations of regional
weather patterns (e.g., Corti et al., 1999).

"¢ Large polar ice masses, ice shelves or even complete ice sheets
may be destabilised by sea level rise (see Section 7.5 and
Chapter 11, Section 11.3.3), thereby contributing to further sea
level rise.

¢ Warming in the high latitudes may lead to significant reductions
in sea ice and associated feedbacks may accelerate this
development (see Box 7.1).

¢ Large-scale and possibly irreversible changes in the terrestrial
biosphere and vegetation cover are thought to have occurred in
the past when anthropogenic perturbation was negligible (e.g.,
the development of the Saharan desert, Claussen et al., 1999).
These changes may be interpreted as non-linear changes
triggered by slow changes in external forcing and thus cannot
be excluded to occur in the future. Knowledge on these
phenomena, however, is not advanced yet.

"	Title
"¢ Confidence in simulating future climates has been enhanced
following a systematic evaluation of models under a limited
number of past climates.
"	List
"¢ Some modelling studies suggest that inclusion of additional
forcings such as solar variability and volcanic aerosols may
improve some aspects of the simulated climate variability of the
20th century.
"	List
"¢ Analysis of, and confidence in, extreme events simulated within
climate models is emerging, particularly for storm tracks and
storm frequency. “Tropical cyclone-like” vortices are being
simulated in climate models, although enough uncertainty
remains over their interpretation to warrant caution in projec-
tions of tropical cyclone changes.
"	List
"¢ The performance of coupled models in simulating the El Nifio-
Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has improved; however, the
region of maximum sea surface temperature variability associ-
ated with El Nifio events is displaced westward and its strength
is generally underestimated. When suitably initialised with an
ocean data assimilation system, some coupled models have had
a degree of success in predicting El Nifio events.
"	List
"Coupled models have evolved and improved significantly since
the SAR. In general, they provide credible simulations of
climate, at least down to sub-continental scales and over
temporal scales from seasonal to decadal. The varying sets of
strengths and weaknesses that models display lead us to
conclude that no single model can be considered “best” and it
is important to utilise results from a range of coupled models.
We consider coupled models, as a class, to be suitable tools to
provide useful projections of future climates.

coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models) for use in
climate change projection and in detection and attribution
studies. We concentrate on the variables and time-scales that are
important for this task. Models are evaluated against observations
and differences between models are explored using information
from a number of systematic model intercomparisons. Even if a
model is assessed as performing credibly when simulating the
present climate, this does not necessarily guarantee that the
response to a perturbation remains credible. Therefore, we also
assess the performance of the models in simulating the climate
over the 20th century and for selected palaeoclimates.
Incremental improvements in the performance of coupled models
have occurred since the IPCC WGI Second Assessment Report
(IPCC, 1996) (hereafter SAR) resulting from advances in the
modelling of the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice and land surface as
well as improvements in the coupling of these components.

"* Coupled models can provide credible simulations of both the
present annual mean climate and the climatological seasonal
cycle over broad continental scales for most variables of
interest for climate change. Clouds and humidity remain
sources of significant uncertainty but there have been
incremental improvements in simulations of these quantities.

¢ Confidence in model projections is increased by the improved
performance of several models that do not use flux adjustment.
These models now maintain stable, multi-century simulations
of surface climate that are considered to be of sufficient quality
to allow their use for climate change projections.

There is no systematic difference between flux adjusted and
non-flux adjusted models in the simulation of internal climate
variability. This supports the use of both types of model in
detection and attribution of climate change.

* Confidence in the ability of models to project future climates is
increased by the ability of several models to reproduce the
warming trend in 20th century surface air temperature when
driven by radiative forcing due to increasing greenhouse gases
and sulphate aerosols. However, only idealised scenarios of
only sulphate aerosols have been used.

The need for flux adjustment and the widely varying spin- up
methodologies in coupled models were areas of concern and the
need for a more systematic evaluation of these on the simulated
climate was expressed. It was noted that, although flux adjust-
ments were generally large in those models that used them, the
absence of flux adjustment generally affected the realism of the
simulated climate and could adversely affect the associated
feedback processes. It was hoped that the need for flux adjustment
would diminish as components were improved.

"Recent discussions by Randall and Wielicki (1997), Shackley et
al. (1998 and 1999), Henderson-Sellers and McGuffie (1999) and
Petersen (2000) illustrate many of the confusions and uncertain-
ties that accompany attempts to evaluate climate models
especially when such models become very complex. We
recognise that, unlike the classic concept of Popper (1982), our
evaluation process is not as clear-cut as a simple search for
“falsification”. While we do not consider that the complexity of a
climate model makes it impossible to ever prove such a model
“false” in any absolute sense, it does make the task of evaluation
extremely difficult and leaves room for a subjective component in
any assessment. The very complexity of climate models means
that there are severe limits placed on our ability to analyse and
understand the model processes, interactions and uncertainties
(Rind, 1999). It is always possible to find errors in simulations of
particular variables or processes in a climate model. What is
important to establish is whether such errors make a given model

“unusable” in answering specific questions.

"We use a wide range of “observations” in order to evaluate
models. However, often the most useful source for a particular
variable is a product of one of the reanalysis projects (most
commonly that of the National Centers for Environmental
Prediction (NCEP) (Kalnay er al., 1996) or from the European
Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)
(Gibson et al., 1997)). Although products from a data assimila-

a combination of observed and model data), the global grided
nature and high time resolution of these products makes them
extremely useful when their accuracy is not in question. Some
additional useful products from reanalysis are not, in fact, the
result of a direct combination of observed and model data but are
in fact the outcome of model integration and hence must be used
with caution. It is important to note that the various variables
available are not all of the same quality and, especially for data-
sparse regions, implicitly contain contributions from the errors in
the underlying model (see also Chapter 2). The overall quality of
reanalysis products is continually assessed at regular

"assessment OF Coupled Model Capadiiules.

Evaluation of the performance of individual components of
the coupled system (especially for atmosphere-only models) was
much more advanced than previously. Results from the first phase
of the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP)
demonstrated that “current atmospheric models generally provide
a realistic portrayal of the phase and amplitude of the seasonal
march of the large-scale distribution of temperature, pressure and
circulation”. The simulation of clouds and their seasonal variation
was noted as the major source of uncertainty in atmospheric
models. In general it was found that “atmospheric models respond
realistically to large-scale sea surface temperature (SST)
patterns” and hence can reproduce many facets of interannual
variability. In the case of the land-surface component, however, it
was noted that “the general agreement found among the results of
relatively simple land-surface schemes in 1990 has been reduced
by the introduction of more complex parametrizations”. Ocean
and sea-ice models were found to “portray the observed large-
scale distribution of temperature, salinity and sea ice more
accurately than in 1990”, but some reservations were expressed
regarding the possible adverse effects of the relatively coarse

resolution of the ocean components of current coupled models.

type of diagram can be used to illustrate the relative accuracy

model would be too complex to run on any existing computer;
hence, for practical purposes, simplifications are made so that the

"The most complex climate models, termed coupled atmosphere-
ocean general circulation models (and abbreviated as AOGCM in
this report), involve coupling comprehensive three-dimensional
atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs), with ocean

with models of land-surface processes, all of which are
extensively reviewed in the SAR (Chapters 4 and 5). For
AOGCMs, information about the state of the atmosphere and the
ocean adjacent to, or at the sea surface, is used to compute
exchanges of heat, moisture and momentum between the two
components. Computational limitations mean that the majority of
sub-grid scale processes are parametrized (see Randall and

"There have been many attempts to obtain a “figure of merit” for
climate models. Usually such quantification is only attempted for
well-observed atmospheric variables and range from calculation
of simple root mean square errors (r.m.s.) between a model
variable and an observation, to more complex multi-variate
calculations. Among the most promising attempts at generating
skill scores deemed more suitable for climate models are: the
normalised mean square error approach of Williamson (1995)
that follows on, in part, from Murphy (1988); and the categorisa-
tion of models in terms of combination of the error in the time
mean and the error in temporal variability along the lines
suggested by Wigley and Santer (1990) (see Chapter 5, Section
5.3.1.1. of the SAR for an example). Other less widely used non-
dimensional measures have also been devised (e.g., Watterson,
1996). Although a number of skill scoring methods have been
devised and used for the seasonal prediction problem (e.g., Potts
et al., 1996; linear error in probability space score — LEPS) these
have not found general application in climate models. Attempts
to derive measures of the goodness of fit between model results
and data containing large uncertainties have been partially
successful in the oceanographic community for a limited number
of variables (Frankignoul et al., 1989; Braconnot and
Frankignoul, 1993). Fuzzy logic techniques have been trialled by
the palaeoclimatology community (Guiot ef al., 1999). It is
important to remember that the types of error measurement that
have been discussed are restricted to relatively few variables. It
has proved elusive to derive a fully comprehensive multi-

dimensional “figure of merit” for climate models.

"In this chapter, we assess climate models on the basis of their
ability to simulate present and past climates. What it means to
simulate a particular climate state is linked to the question of
model initialisation. Ideally, given a “perfect model’, and
“perfect knowledge” of the present climate state, one could
simply initialise a climate model with the present state. Then,
given perpetual present day forcing (from trace substances and
solar radiation), one might expect the model to remain close to
the present state, perhaps with some level of variability. However,
in practice, this ideal is not achieved and a model initialised in
this way adjusts from the initial state. This adjustment has been
characterised by two time-scales (Bryan, 1998): in the initial
“fast” adjustment, the atmosphere, land surface, ocean mixed
layer and sea ice reach a state of near equilibrium, typically
taking 5 to 50 years. Surface temperature error patterns (e.g.,
Figure 8.la) are generally established on this time-scale, and
persist over many centuries of integration, but there typically
remain slight imbalances in the surface heat and fresh water
fluxes. These imbalances drive a second, slower, adjustment
phase (often called “climate drift”) which takes place over
centuries to millennia and involves adjustment of the deep ocean
to the surface imbalances. This “climate drift” can make interpre-
tation of transient climate change simulations difficult, so models
are generally allowed to adjust to a state where such drifts have
become acceptably slow, before starting climate change simula-
tions. A number of techniques have been used to achieve this (see
Stouffer and Dixon, 1998), but it is not possible, in general, to say
which of these procedures gives “better” initial conditions for a
climate change projection run.

"Recently, significant advances have occurred in the development
of Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMIC),
which are designed to bridge the gap between the three-
dimensional comprehensive models and simple models. The
main characteristic of EMICs is that they describe most of the
processes implicit in comprehensive models, albeit in a more
reduced (i.e., more parametrized) form. They also explicitly
simulate the interactions among several components of the
climate system including biogeochemical cycles. On the other
hand, EMICs are computationally efficient enough to allow for
long-term climate simulations over several tens of thousands of
years or a broad range of sensitivity experiments over several
millennia. As for AOGCMs, but in contrast to simple models, the
number of degrees of freedom of an EMIC exceeds the number
of adjustable parameters by several orders of magnitude.
Currently, there are several EMICs in operation such as: two-
dimensional, zonally averaged ocean models coupled to a simple
atmospheric module (e.g., Stocker et al., 1992; Marchal et al.,
1998) or geostrophic two-dimensional (e.g., Gallee et al., 1991)
or statistical-dynamical (e.g., Petoukhov et al., 2000)
atmospheric modules; three-dimensional models with a statis-
tical-dynamical atmospheric and oceanic modules (Petoukhov ert
al., 1998; Handorf et al., 1999); reduced-form comprehensive
models (e.g., Opsteegh ef al., 1998) and those that involve an
energy-moisture balance model coupled to an OGCM and a sea-
ice model (e.g., Fanning and Weaver, 1996). Some EMICs have
been used to investigate both the climate of the last glacial
maximum (see Section 8.5) as well as to investigate the cause of
the collapse of the conveyor in global warming experiments
(Stocker and Schmittner, 1997; Rahmstorf and Ganopolski,
1999) while others have been used to undertake a number of
sensitivity studies including the role of sub-grid scale ocean
mixing in global warming experiments (Wiebe and Weaver,

a source of uncertainty: the approach inherently disguises sources
of systematic error in the models, and may distort their sensitivity
to changed radiative forcing. Models which did not use flux

It appears that the success of the recent models which do not

(Weaver and Hughes, 1996; Guilyardi and Madec, 1997; Johns et

both atmospheric (Section 8.5.1.2.2) and oceanic (Section

advance. Such models have the advantage over flux-adjusted
models that, provided the large-scale balances are obtained using
a physically justifiable choice of model parameters, these models
are physically self-consistent representations of the climate
system. However, in some cases only very loose physical

Recently a number of coupled models have emerged with
greatly improved surface climatologies without using flux
adjustments. Figure 8.1a shows SST errors from one such model,
about 100 years after initialisation. Errors are generally less than
2°C, and the error pattern shown is stable over several centuries
of integration. However some larger errors are seen, in particular
a cooling in the North Pacific, a warming in the eastern tropical
ocean basins (probably due to a lack of stratocumulus cloud
there), and a warming in the southern ocean. These errors appeat
to be common to a number of more recent non-flux adjusted

(ARPEGE/OPA2, Institut Pierre Simon Laplace/Coupled
Atmosphere-Ocean- Vegetation Model (IPSL-CM2), Barthelet e:
al., 1998a,b). The surface climatologies in several non-flux
adjusted models are now considered good enough and stable
enough to use those models for climate change projections.
Typical flux adjusted models do show smaller SST errors.
because the flux adjustments are chosen specifically to minimise
those errors (Figure 8.1b). For comparison, Figure 8.1c shows the

The SAR’ s evaluation of coupled: -model simulations focused on
surface air temperature, sea level pressure and precipitation. The
SAR concluded that model simulations of surface air tempera-
ture were “very similar” to observations. Simulations of the
other two quantities were found to be less accurate but neverthe-
less reasonable: the SAR concluded that coupled models
represented “the observed large-scale geographical distribution”
of sea level pressure “rather well”, and that they were “generally
successful in simulating the broad-scale structure of the

observed precipitation”.

"Firstly, the SAR found that simulation of clouds and related
processes “remains a major source of uncertainty in atmospheric
models”. As discussed in Chapter 7, these processes continue to
account for most of the uncertainty in predicting human-induced
climate change. Secondly, the SAR noted an unsatisfactory
situation involving flux adjustments (Section 8.4.2): they “are
relatively large in the models that use them, but their absence
affects the realism of the control climate and the associated
feedback processes”. Improvements in coupled climate models
since the SAR have addressed both points of concern. For the
atmospheric (as well as the oceanic) component, these improve-
ments have included higher horizontal resolution (which means
less numerical diffusion and better representation of topography),
and advances in parametrizations. In addition, the advent of the
Coupled Model Intercomparison Program (CMIP; see Meehl er
al., 2000a) since the SAR has provided an additional database for
evaluating AOGCMs. Some basic details of models evaluated in
this chapter and used elsewhere in this report are presented in
Table 8.1.

Marotzke and Stone (1995) show that using flux adjustment to
correct surface errors in the control climate does not necessarily
correct errors in processes which control the climate change
response. Flux adjustments can also result in spurious multiple
equilibrium states of the tropical (Neelin and Dijkstra, 1995) and
thermohaline (Dijkstra and Neelin, 1999) ocean circulation. On
the other hand, a good representation of, say, sea-ice extent may
be important to produce the correct magnitude of ice-albedo
feedback under climate change, and it may be preferable to use
flux adjustments to give a good sea-ice distribution than to omit
the flux adjustments but to have a poorer sea-ice extent. Overall,
differences have been seen in the climate change response of flux
adjusted and equivalent non-flux adjusted models (Fanning and
Weaver, 1997b; Gregory and Mitchell, 1997), but it is not clear
whether the differences are due to the flux adjustment itself, or to
the systematic errors in the non-flux adjusted model. The only
practical way to resolve this issue may be to continue the
progress which has been made towards models which achieve
good surface climatology without flux adjustment, whereupon
the effect of flux adjustments will cease to be of concern.

Observational uncertainties are indicated in Figure 8.4 by
including extra observational data sets as additional points, as if
they were models. These additional points exhibit greater
agreement with the baseline observations as expected. It is
noteworthy, however, that the differences between alternate sets
of observations are not much smaller than the differences
between models and the baseline observations. This result
implies that in terms of variance and space-time pattern correla-
tion, the models nearly agree with observations to within the

(2001) demonstrate that the model mean exhibits good agreement

Inspection of these portions of the figures reaffirms the SAR
conclusions summarised above. The errors in model-mean
surface air temperature rarely exceed 1°C over the oceans and
5°C over the continents; precipitation and sea level pressure
errors are relatively greater but the magnitudes and patterns of
these quantities are recognisably similar to observations. The
bottom portion of Figure 8.2 shows maps of the model mean
taken separately over all flux adjusted models (lower left) and all
non-flux adjusted models (lower right). Flux adjusted models are
generally more similar to the observations — and to each other —
than are non-flux adjusted models. However, errors in the non-
flux adjusted model mean are not grossly larger than errors in the
flux adjusted model mean (except in polar regions). This result
from the “‘inter-model’” CMIP database suggests that the SAR
was correct in anticipating that the need for flux adjustments
would diminish as coupled models improve. It is reinforced by
“intra-model ensembles”, i.e., by the experience that improve-

"The foregoing points are made in a more quantitative
fashion by Figures 8.4 to 8.6 (reproduced from Covey et al.,
2000b). Figure 8.4 gives the standard deviation and correlation
with observations of the total spatial and temporal variability
(including the seasonal cycle, but omitting the global mean) for
surface air temperature, sea level pressure and precipitation in
the CMIP2 simulations. The standard deviation is normalised to
its observed value and the correlation ranges from zero along an
upward vertical line to unity along a line pointing to the right.
Consequently, the observed behaviour of the climate is
represented by a point on the horizontal axis a unit distance
from the origin. In this coordinate system, the linear distance
between each model’s point and the “observed” point is propor-
tional to the r.m.s. model error (Taylor, 2000; see also Box 8.1).
Surface air temperature is particularly well simulated, with
nearly all models closely matching the observed magnitude of
variance and exhibiting a correlation > 0.95 with the observa-
tions. Sea level pressure and precipitation are simulated less
well, but the simulated variance is still within +25% of
observed and the correlation with observations is noticeably
positive (about 0.7 to 0.8 for sea level pressure and 0.4 to 0.6 for
precipitation).

extent and the source (or sources) of this discrepancy have been

estimates come from the Global Energy Balance Archive

hand, is underestimated (Garratt and Prata, 1996; Wild et al.,
1997). The shortwave discrepancy is of more concern: it is more
than a factor of two larger than the long-wave discrepancy, and
could be due to missing absorption processes in the atmosphere.

The SAR concluded that although atmospheric models
adequately simulate the three-dimensional temperature distribu-
tion and wind patterns, “current models portray the large-scale
latitudinal structure and seasonal change of the observed total
cloud cover with only fair accuracy”. Subsequent studies have
confirmed both the good and bad aspects of model simulations.
Throughout most of the troposphere, errors in AMIP1 ensemble
simulations of temperature and zonal wind are small compared
with either inter-model scatter or the observed spatial standard
deviation (Gates et al., 1999). (See Section 8.8 for brief discus-
sion of storm tracks.) On the other hand, discrepancies between
models and observations that substantially exceed the observa-
tional uncertainty are evident for both clouds (Mokhov and Love,
1995; Weare et al., 1995, 1996; Weare, 2000a, 2000b) and upper
tropospheric humidity (see Chapter 7).

"2000a). (That study, however, also noted that many of the non-
flux adjusted models suffered from unrealistic “climate drift” up
to about 1°C / century in global mean surface temperature.) The
relatively small differences between flux adjusted and non-flux
adjusted models noted above suggest that flux adjustments could
be — indeed, are being — dispensed with at acceptable cost in
many climate models, at least for the century time-scale integra-
tions of interest in detecting and predicting anthropogenic
climate change. In recent models that omit flux adjustment, the
representation of atmospheric fields has in some cases actually
improved, compared with older, flux-adjusted versions of the
models. Examples include the HadCM3 model and the CSM 1.0
model. In CSM 1.0, atmospheric temperature, precipitation and
atmospheric circulation are close to values simulated when the
atmospheric component of the CSM 1.0 model is driven by
observed sea surface temperatures (Boville and Hurrell, 1998).

Although solutions to these problems have proved elusive,
incremental improvements have been noted since publication of
the SAR. For total cloudiness, a revised subset of AMIP models
exhibits noticeably less inter-model variation and significantly
less average r.m.s error (Gates et al., 1999; Figure 8.7), compared
with the original versions of the models. Several models
adequately simulate seasonal changes in cloud radiative forcing
(Cess et al., 1997). Model intercomparisons organised under the
Global Energy and Water cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Cloud
System Study (Stewart et al., 1998) will provide further informa-
tion for improving cloud simulation. For tropospheric humidity,
improved agreement with observations may result from improved
numerical techniques (Section 8.9). Furthermore, even though
the seasonal mean amounts of clouds and upper tropospheric
water vapour are not well simulated in current climate models,
variations of these quantities may be more important than
absolute amounts for predicting climate changes. For example,
Del Genio et al. (1994) noted that, in mid-latitudes, the seasonal
cycle of upper tropospheric humidity can be simulated reason-
ably well by climate models. They argued that this variation
provides a surrogate for decadal climate change in mid-latitudes
because both are characterised by combined temperature increase
and latitudinal temperature-gradient decrease, and thus both have
similar effects on storms.

Proper accounting of the role of gravity waves can improve
stratospheric modelling. An orographic gravity wave scheme has
been shown to improve the cold pole problem. Recent work with
non-orographic gravity wave schemes show that waves of non-
zero phase speed result in equatorward inclined jet through larger
deceleration of westerly winds in polar regions (Manzini and
McFarlane, 1998; Medvedev er al., 1998). Nevertheless, all
models have shortcomings in their simulations of the present day

predictions of future climate change (Shindell et al., 1999).

The observational phase of the World Ocean Circulation
Experiment (WOCE) was completed in 1997. Much analysis of
the data to date has concentrated on individual sections or
regions, and some of this analysis has been used in the assess-
ment of climate models (e.g., Banks, 2000). Some initial attempts
to put sections together into a consistent global picture also
appear promising (MacDonald, 1998; de las Heras and Schlitzer,
1999). Such a global picture is an important baseline against
which models can be tested (Gent et al., 1998; Gordon et al.,
2000; see also Chapter 7, Section 7.6).

Coupled climate models simulate mean atmospheric fields with
reasonable accuracy, with the exception of clouds and some
related hydrological processes (in particular those involving
upper tropospheric humidity). Since publication of the SAR, the
models have continued to simulate most fields reasonably well
while relying less on arbitrary flux adjustments. Problems in the
simulation of clouds and upper tropospheric humidity, however,
remain worrisome because the associated processes account for
most of the uncertainty in climate model simulations of anthro-
pogenic change. Incremental improvements in these aspects of
model simulation are being made.

Section 8.4.2 and Chapter 7, Section 7.6 discuss the fundamental
importance of poleward heat transport in modelling the climate
system. Ocean heat transport is greatly improved in some more
recent models, compared with the models in use at the time of the
SAR (see, e.g., Table 8.2; Chapter 7, Section 7.6). Increased
horizontal resolution (Fanning and Weaver, 1997a; Gordon et al.,
2000) and improved parametrization of sub-grid scale mixing
(Danabasoglu and McWilliams, 1996; Visbeck et al., 1997;
Gordon et al., 2000) have been important factors in this. The
fresh water transports of coupled models have not been widely
evaluated (see Section 8.4.2 and Chapter 7, Section 7.6). Bryan
(1998) shows how fresh water imbalances can lead to long-term
drifts in deep ocean properties.

"The wind-driven dynamics of the interior of the ocean basins are
largely a linear response to the wind, and are generally well
represented in current models, although there is still some
observational debate over the reality of the classical Sverdrup
balance (Wunsch and Roemmich, 1985). The main errors can
usually be traced back to errors in the driving winds from the
atmospheric model. The same can be said of surface Ekman
transport, which makes an important contribution to poleward
heat transport in the tropics (Danabasoglu, 1998). However, the
western boundary currents and inertial recirculations which close
the wind-driven gyres are generally poorly resolved by current
models, and this may lead to an underestimate of the heat
transport by this component of the system at higher latitudes
(Fanning and Weaver, 1997a; Bryan and Smith 1998).

"There have been a number of important developments in the
ocean components of climate models since the SAR. Many
climate models now being used for climate projections have
ocean resolution of order 1 to 2° (Table 8.1), whereas at the time
of the SAR most models used in projections had ocean resolution
of order 3 to 5° (SAR Tables 5.1 and 6.3). The improved resolu-
tion may contribute to better representation of poleward heat
transport (Section 8.5.2.2.2), although some key processes are
still not resolved (see Sections 8.5.2.3, 8.9.2). Coupled models
with even finer resolution are under development at the time of
writing, but their computational expense makes their use in
climate change projections impractical at present. Advances in
the parametrization of sub-grid scale mixing (Chapter 7, Section
7.3.4) have also led to improved heat transports (Section
8.5.2.2.2). Some models have also adopted more advanced
parametrizations of the surface mixed layer (Guilyardi and
Madec, 1997; Gent et al., 1998; see Chapter 7, Section 7.3.1)

Many current models produce rather poor estimates of the
volume transport of the Antarctic circumpolar current (ACC)
(Table 8.2). The reason for this is not fully understood.
Thermohaline as well as wind-driven processes are believed to be
important (Cox 1989; Bryan 1998). The problem is shared by
some eddy-permitting ocean models, so insufficient horizontal
resolution does not seem to be the only factor. The path of the
ACC is largely controlled by topography, and errors in the path
can lead to significant local sea surface temperature errors. The
Atlantic and Indian sectors of the southern ocean appear to be
particularly susceptible (e.g., Figure 8.1b; Gent et al., 1998;
Gordon et al., 2000). However, it is not clear how, or whether, the
transport and SST errors impact on the atmospheric climate or on
the climate change response of the models.

realism of the ocean component of climate models. Models now
exist which simultaneously maintain realistic poleward heat
transports, surface temperatures and thermocline structure, and
this has been a vital contributor to the improvement in non-flux
adjusted models. However, there are still a number of processes
which are poorly resolved or represented, for example western
boundary currents (see Chapter 7, Section 7.3.6), convection

Work since the SAR has also focused on trying to identify the
relative significance of land-surface processes in comparison with
other components of climate models. The sophistication in the
representation of the land surface in coupled models is varied (see
Chapter 7 and Table 8.1). The addition of more realistic plant
physiology in some land-surface models (e.g., Bonan, 1995;
Sellers et al., 1996 (See Chapter 7, Section 7.4)) which permits the
simulation of carbon dioxide (CO ) and gas isotope fluxes,
provides the opportunity to compare these quantities with local
scale, regional scale and global scale observations from flux towers
and satellites.

"Snow, and the snow albedo feedback, are important
components of the land surface. Current climate models incorpo-
rate snow in varying degrees of sophistication and there is currently
major uncertainty in the ability of land-surface schemes to simulate
snow mass or cover (see Chapter 7, Section 7.5). Frei and
Robinson (1998) evaluated the simulation of monthly mean snow
extent from 27 AMIP AGCMs and found weaknesses in the
simulation of the seasonal cycle of snow extent and a general
underestimation in interannual variability. These weaknesses limit
confidence in the simulation of mid- and high latitude changes
simulated by current climate models, since a failure to simulate
snow accurately tends to impact significantly on albedo, surface
roughness length and soil moisture (and therefore precipitation on
subsequent seasons).

Other components of the land surface potentially important
to climate change include lateral water flows from the continents
into the ocean, permafrost, land-based ice and ice sheets. Some
land-surface schemes now include river routing (e.g., Sausen et
al., 1994; Hagemann and Diimenil, 1998) in order to simulate the
annual cycle of river discharge into the ocean. This appears to
improve the modelling of runoff from some large drainage basins
(Diimenil et al., 1997), although water storage and runoff in
regions of frozen soil moisture remain outstanding problems
(Arpe et al., 1997; Pitman et al., 1999). River routing is also
useful in diagnosing the representation of the hydrological cycle
in models (e.g., Kattsov et al., 2000). There has been limited
progress towards developing a permafrost model for use in
climate models (e.g., Malevsky-Malevich et al., 1999) although
existing simple models appear to approximate the observed range
in permafrost reasonably well (e.g., Volodin and Lykosov, 1998).
The dynamics of ice sheets and calving are not presently
represented in coupled climate models. To close the fresh water

"Most of the effort in trying to reduce the disparity in land-surface
scheme performance has been performed in offline intercompar-
isons under the auspices of International Geosphere Biosphere
Programme (IGBP) and the World Climate Research Programme
(WCRP). Due to the difficulties in coupling multiple land-surface
schemes into climate models (see Section 8.5.4.3) specific endeav-
ours have been: the Project for the Intercomparison of Land-
surface Parametrization Schemes (PILPS), the Global Soil Wetness
Project (GSWP), the International Satellite Land Surface
Climatology Project (ISLSCP), and the Biological Aspects of the
Hydrological Cycle (BAHC) (e.g., Henderson-Sellers et al., 1995;
Polcher et al., 1996; Dirmeyer et al., 1999; Schlosser et al., 2000).
In comparisons between offline simulation results and observa-
tions, difficulties in partitioning available energy between sensible
and latent heat and partitioning of available water between
evaporation and runoff were highlighted (e.g., Chen et al., 1997;
Schlosser et al., 2000). While we are far from a complete
understanding of why land surface models differ by such a large
degree, some progress has been made (e.g., Koster and Milly,
1997; Desborough, 1999). Significant progress has also been made
in adding physical processes into land-surface models (see Chapter
7, Section 7.4). Where some observations exist (e.g., for incoming
solar radiation, net radiation and soil moisture), an evaluation of the
ability of current climate models to simulate these quantities
suggests that significant problems remain (Wild ef al., 1997;
Garratt et al., 1998; Robock et al., 1998). The evaluation of surface
processes in climate models tends to focus on monthly and, less
commonly, daily quantities. An evaluation of the ability of climate
models to simulate land-surface quantities at the diurnal scale has
yet to be performed systematically, although some efforts have
been initiated since the SAR (e g Watterson, +1997)

Uncertainty in climate simulations resulting from the land
surface has traditionally been deduced from offline experiments
(see Chapter 7 and Section 8.5.4.2) due to difficulties associated
with comparing land-surface schemes when forced by different
climate models (e.g., Polcher et al., 1998b). Some work since the
SAR has focused on the sensitivity of land-surface schemes to
uncertainties in parameters (e.g., Milly, 1997) and on whether
different land-surface schemes, coupled to climate models, lead
to different climate simulations or different sensitivity to

and that it can not be deduced from results obtained for present

regionally and found that the simulations differ markedly in
terms of their predicted changes in evapotranspiration and soil
moisture. They conclude that uncertainty in the predicted
changes in surface hydrology is more dependent on gross
features of the runoff versus soil moisture relationship than on the
detailed treatment of evapotranspiration. The importance of
hydrology was also demonstrated by Ducharne et al. (1998) and

Polcher et al. (1998a) used four different climate models,
each coupled to two different land-surface schemes to explore the
role of the land surface under 1 XCO, and 2*CO3. The modifi-
cation to the land-surface scheme tended to focus on aspects of
the soil-hydrology and vegetation/soil-moisture interactions
(Gedney et al., 2000). To measure the uncertainty associated with
surface processes, the variance of anomalies caused by the
changes to the surface scheme in the four climate models was
computed. The uncertainty in climate models was computed by
using the variance of annual anomalies relative to a consensus
(the average of all models). This measure takes into account the
differences between climate models, as well as the internal
variance of the atmosphere. With these two variances, a ratio was
constructed to evaluate the relative importance of the uncertainty
linked to surface processes in comparison to the uncertainty
linked to other aspects of the climate model (Crossley er al.,
2000). In Figure 8.12a this diagnostic is applied to zonal mean
values over land for the 1 XCO, experiments. The highest values,
indicating a large contribution of surface processes to the
uncertainty, were obtained for evaporation, the variable most
affected by surface processes (the asterisk indicates significance
at the 95% of this measure). Surface air temperature was strongly
dependent on surface processes in the tropics but at high latitudes
its uncertainty was dominated by atmospheric processes. In the
high latitudes, the hydrological cycle (characterised by precipita-
tion and cloud cover) was partly controlled by the surface as
indicated by high values of the ratio. Overall, Figure 8.12 shows
that the contribution to total uncertainty in the simulation of
climate resulting from the land surface may be large and varies
geographically.

Uncertainty in land- surface | processes, coupled with
uncertainty in parameter data combines, at this time, to limit the
confidence we have in the simulated regional impacts of
increasing CO). In general, the evidence suggests that the
uncertainty is largely restricted to surface quantities (i.e., the
large-scale climate changes simulated by coupled climate models
are probably relatively insensitive to land-surface processes). Our
uncertainty derives from difficulties in the modelling of snow,
evapotranspiration and below-ground processes. Overall, at
regional scales, and if land-surface quantities are considered (soil
moisture, evaporation, runoff, etc.), uncertainties in our
understanding and simulation of land-surface processes limit the
reliability of predicted changes in surface quantities.

"Vegetation changes reconstructed from pollen data in the
BIOME 6000 project (Jolly et al., 1998b; Prentice and Webb III,
1998) provide a quantitative model-data comparison in northern
Africa. The PMIP simulations produce a northward displacement
of the desert-steppe transition, qualitatively consistent with
biomes, but strongly underestimated in extent (Harrison er al.,
1998). At least an additional 100 mm/yr of precipitation would be
required for most models to sustain grassland at 23°N, i.e., more
than twice as much as simulated in this area (Joussaume et al.,
1999) (Figure 8.13). The increased area of lakes in the Sahara has
also been quantified (Hoelzmann et al., 1998) and, although the
PMIP simulations do produce an increase, this latter is not large
enough (Coe and Harrison, 2000). A similar underestimation is
obtained at high latitudes over northern Eurasia, where PMIP
simulations produce a northward shift of the Arctic tree-line in
agreement with observed shifts (Tarasov et al., 1998) but strongly
underestimated in extent (Kutzbach ef al., 1996b; Texier et al.,

however, be due to missing feedbacks in the simplified PMIP

"Accurate simulation of current climate does not guarantee the
ability of a model to simulate climate change correctly. Climate
models now have some skill in simulating changes in climate
since 1850 (see Section 8.6.1), but these changes are fairly small
compared with many projections of climate change into the 21st
century. An important motivation for attempting to simulate the
climatic conditions of the past is that such experiments provide
opportunities for evaluating how models respond to large
changes in forcing. Following the pioneering work of the Co-
operative Holocene Mapping Project (COHMAP-Members,
1988), the Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project
(PMIP) (Joussaume and Taylor, 1995; PMIP, 2000) has fostered

the first two types dominated. Over much of Eurasia, forests were
replaced by tundra or steppe (Prentice et al., 1998) which may
have contributed to the observed cooling over Europe (Crowley
and Baum, 1997; Kubatzki and Claussen, 1998; Levis et al.,
1999). Permafrost may also have to be accounted for (Renssen et
al., 2000). In the tropics though, there is yet no systematic
improvement of the simulated cooling, since the models find
large areas of warming due to the simulated deforestation
(Crowley and Baum, 1997; Levis et al., 1999). However, land-
surface feedbacks may also have affected climate through
mineral aerosol (dust) concentrations (Mahowald et al., 1999).

Evaluating the consistency between the simulated climate
and that reconstructed from palaeo-data can potentially provide
an independent check that model sensitivity is neither too large
nor too small. A detailed analysis of a subset of the PMIP models
(Taylor et al., 2000), shows that their forcing estimates for the
LGM vary from about —4 to -6 Wm and that their global
climate sensitivity, given relatively to a doubling of CO), ranges
from 3.2 to 3.9°C (assuming that climate sensitivity is
independent of the type of forcing, although one model study
shows a slightly stronger sensitivity at the LGM than for a CO,
doubling (Hewitt and Mitchell, 1997)). A direct evaluation of
climate sensitivity is, however, very difficult since global temper-
ature changes are poorly known. Hoffert and Covey (1992)
estimated a global cooling of —3 + 0.6°C from CLIMAP (1981)
SST data which would, using the simulated range of forcing,
yield to a global climate sensitivity for a doubling of CO, ranging
from 1.4 to 3.2°C, which probably gives a lower estimate of
climate sensitivity since CLIMAP SSTs tend to be relatively too
warm in the tropics (see below).

"An alternative approach to evaluating climate sensitivity is
provided by the detailed comparison of model results with proxy-
data over different regions. The amplitude of the tropical cooling
at LGM has long been disputed (Rind and Peteet, 1985;
Guilderson et al., 1994). Compared to a new synthesis of terres-
trial data (Farrera et al., 1999), PMIP simulations with prescribed
CLIMAP sea-surface conditions produce land temperatures that
are too warm (Pinot et al., 1999) (Figure 8.14), which may be due
to too-warm prescribed SSTs, as indicated by new marine data
based on alkenone palaeo-thermometry (Rosell-Melé ef al.,
1998) (Figure 8.14). Some mixed-layer ocean models have
produced more realistic sea and land temperature cooling (Pinot
et al., 1999), enhancing our confidence in using such models to
estimate climate sensitivity (see Chapter 9, Section 9.3.4) (Figure
8.14). The same conclusion is derived by Broccoli (2000) when
accounting for uncertainties in both the forcing and reconstructed
climate from various proxy data. Over Eurasia, all the models
simulate a cooling in fairly good agreement with proxy data
estimates, except over western Europe (Kageyama et al., 2001),
where they all underestimate the winter cooling shown from
pollen data (Peyron et al., 1998). However, such simulations have
an important caveat since they prescribe present day ocean heat
transport whereas changes in the North Atlantic deep water
circulation shown by two EMIC models (Ganopolski et al.,
1998b; Weaver et al., 1998) and also inferred by palaeo-oceano-
graphic data (e.g., Duplessy ef al., 1988) may further decrease
temperatures over Europe.

As noted in the SAR, the inclusion of the direct effect of
sulphate aerosols is important since the radiative forcing associ-
ated with 20th century greenhouse gas increase alone tends to
overestimate the 20th century warming in most models. Groups
that have included a representation of the direct effects of
sulphate aerosols have found that their model generally
reproduces the observed trend in the instrumental surface air
temperature warming, thereby suggesting that their combination
of model climate sensitivity and oceanic heat uptake is not
unrealistic (see Chapter 9, Section 9.2.1 and Figure 9.7). These
same models have more difficulty representing variability
observed within the 20th century instrumental record (Sections
8.6.2, 8.6.3). As mentioned in Section 8.6.3, some modelling
studies suggest that the inclusion of additional forcings from solar
variability and volcanic aerosols may improve aspects of this
simulated variability. Delworth and Knutson (2000), on the other
hand, note that one of their six 20th century integrations (using
GFDL_R30_c) bears a striking resemblance to the observed 20th
century warming which occurs primarily in two distinct periods

As noted in Chapter 2, Sections 2.2.2 and 2.2.3, land surface
temperatures show a greater rate of warming than do lower
tropospheric air temperatures over the last 20 years (see also
discussion in Chapter 2, Section 2.2.4). While noting uncertainties
in the observational records (Chapter 2, Sections 2.2.2 and 2.2.3),
the National Research Council (NRC) (2000) pointed out that
models, which tend not to show such a differential trend, need to
better capture the vertical and temporal profiles of the radiative
forcing especially associated with water vapour and tropospheric
and stratospheric ozone and aerosols, and the effects of the latter
on clouds. Santer et al. (2000) provide further evidence to support
this notion from integrations conducted with the
ECHAM4/OPYC3 AOGCM (Bengtsson ef al. 1999; Roeckner et
al., 1999) that includes a representation of the direct and indirect
effects of sulphate aerosols, as well as changes in tropospheric
ozone. They showed that the further inclusion of stratospheric
ozone depletion and stratospheric aerosols associated with the
Pinatubo eruption lead to a better agreement with observed
tropospheric temperature changes since 1979, although discrepan-
cies still remain (see Chapter 12, Section 12.3.2 and Figure 12.4).

The aforementioned studies all prescribed the temporal and
geographical distribution of sulphate aerosols and included their
radiative effects by perturbing the surface albedo according to the
amount of sulphate loading in the atmospheric column above the
surface (see Chapter 6, Sections 6.7, 6.8 and 6.14). This approach
both ignores the indirect effect of these aerosols (i.e., their effects
on cloud formation) as well as weather affects on aerosol redistri-
bution and removal. Roeckner ef al. (1999) made a major step
forward by incorporating a sulphur cycle model into the
ECHAM4(ECMWE/MPI AGCM)/OPYC3(Ocean isoPYCnal
GCM) AOGCM to eliminate these shortcomings. In addition,
they included the radiative forcing due to anthropogenic changes
in tropospheric ozone by prescribing ozone levels obtained from
an offline tropospheric chemistry model coupled to ECHAM4.
The simulation of the 20th century climate obtained from this
model (Bengtsson et al. 1999), which includes the indirect effect
of aerosols, shows a good agreement with the general 20th
century trend in warming (see Chapter 12, Section 12.4.3.3). The
results of this study also suggest that the agreement between
model and observed 20th century warming trends, achieved
without the inclusion of the indirect aerosol effect, was probably
accomplished with an overestimated direct effect or an overesti-
mated transient oceanic heat uptake. Alternatively, since these
studies include only idealised scenarios of sulphate radiative
forcing alone (direct and/or indirect) that do not include the
apparent effects of other aerosol types (Chapter 6), one might
view the sulphate treatment as a surrogate, albeit with large
uncertainty, for the radiative forcing associated with all anthro-
pogenic aerosols.

(Large-Scale Geostrophic ocean model)) to the variability found
in the same observational data set (Jones and Briffa, 1992; Jones
1994). They argued that, over the instrumental period, the
simulated variability on annual to decadal time-scales was fairly
realistic both in terms of the geographical distribution and the
global mean values with a notable exception of the poor simula-
tion of observed tropical Pacific variability (Figure 8.18). The
HadCM2 model substantially overestimated tropical Pacific
variability, whereas it was underestimated in the GFDL_R15_a
and ECHAM3/LSG models. They also noticed that on the inter-
decadal time-scale, the greatest variance in the models was
generally located near sea-ice margins close to regions of deep
oceanic convection and associated with low-frequency variations
of the thermohaline circulation. While the three models generally
agreed on the dominant modes of variability, there was substan-
tial inter-model disparity in the magnitude of each mode. The
analysis of Stouffer et al. (2000) can easily be reconciled with
Barnett (1999) by realising that Stouffer et al. (2000) examined a
subset (GFDL_R15_a, HadCM2, ECHAM3/LSG models) of
those CMIP models considered by Barnett (1999) that did not
experience climate drift, and that less emphasis was placed on the

"Barnett (1999) concatenated the annual mean near-surface

of eleven CMIP control experiments to produce common
empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) for the eleven AOGCMs.
By projecting the Global Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature
(GISST) annual mean temperature anomaly data set (Rayner et
al. 1996) onto these common EOFs, he was able to estimate to
what extent model variability represented the observed
variability. An analysis of the partial eigenvalue spectrum for the
different models (Figure 8.17a) suggests that there is consider-
able disparity between the estimates of variability within the
coupled models. Some of this disparity arises from model drift
and other low-frequency variability. Intra-model disparity was
much lower than inter-model disparity as demonstrated by a
similar common EOF analysis obtained from ten 100 year
segments in the 1,000 year GFDL_R15_a control run (Figure
8.17b). While the highest two modes were substantially underes-
timated in the GFDL_R15_a model, the higher modes agreed
better with observations. Error bars on the observational data are
large and when this is taken into account, model disagreement
with observations may not be significant. As Barnett (1999) did
not remove the trend over the 20th century in the GISST data set,
the observations also contain responses to both natural and
anthropogenic forcing. One would therefore expect control
integrations from coupled climate models to underestimate the
observed spectrum at low frequencies (e.g., Folland et al., 1999).

systematic comparison of AOGCM variability with variability
found in the Holocene proxy temperature record. However, three
studies (from the MPI (Max Planck Institute), Hadley Centre and

GFDL_RI5_a (Stouffer et al., 1994) and ECHAM1/LSG

Duffy et al. (2000) also partitioned the CMIP models into
those that are flux adjusted and those that are not. They defined
two measures of temperature variability and applied them to the
CMIP control simulations. The simulations differed substantially
in the amount of temperature variability they showed. However,
on time-scales of 1 year to 20 years, the flux adjusted simulations
did not have significantly less variability than the non-flux
adjusted simulations; there is some suggestion that they may have
more variability. Thus it cannot be argued, for example, that the
use of flux adjusted models in studies of detection of anthro-
pogenic climate change tends to make observed temperature
changes seem more significant than they should be, compared to
natural internal climate variability. Nevertheless, it is still an open
question as to how coupled model variability depends on internal
model parameters and resolution.

Using annual and decadal mean near- r-surface palaeo-temper-
ature reconstructions at seventeen locations Jones et al. (1998)
demonstrated, through a principal component analysis, that the
standard deviation of the GFDL_R15_a model (Stouffer er al.,
1994) and the HadCM2 model (Johns ef al., 1997; Tett et al.,
1997) principal component time-series compared favourably with
both proxy and observed data. Time-series of the top seven
principal components did, however, show much less century time-
scale variability than in the proxy time-series. This was especially
true in the HadCM2 model that was dominated by tropic-wide
decadal variability. Through cross-spectral analysis they
concluded that the “GFDL control integration bears a remarkable
similarity in its statistical properties to that obtained from the
proxy data. In view of this similarity it appears the spatial
structures from the control integration can be used to represent the
spatial structures of naturally occurring variations in near-surface

The inclusion of changes in solar irradiance and volcanic

AOGCMs. In addition, some evaluation studies aimed at the
reproduction of 20th century climate have suggested that changes
in solar irradiance may be important to include in order to
reproduce the warming in the early part of the century. Another
study has suggested that this early warming can be solely
explained as a consequence of natural internal climate variability.

"Land-cover change can occur through human intervention (land
clearance), via direct effects of changes in CO, on vegetation
physiology and structure, and via climate changes (Chapter 7).

7.4.2) and modelling studies (e.g., Betts et al., 1997, 2000;
Chase et al., 2000; Zhao et al., 2001) demonstrate that changes
in land cover can have a significant impact on the regional scale
climate but suggestions that land clearance has an impact on the
global scale climate is currently speculative. Evidence from
palaeoclimate (Section 8.5) and modelling work (Section 8.5

On time-scales of decades the impact of land cover change
could significantly influence the rate of atmospheric CO,
increase (Chapter 3), the nature and extent of the physical
climate system response, and ultimately, the response of the
biosphere to global change (Chapter 8). Models currently under
development that can represent changes in land cover resulting
from changes in climate and CO) should enable the simulations
of these processes in the future. If these models can be coupled
with scenarios representing human-induced changes in land
cover over the next 50 to 100 years, the important effects of
land- cover change can be included in climate models. While the
inclusion of these models of the biosphere is not expected to
change the global scale response to increasing CO,, they may
significantly effect the simulations of local and regional scale
change.

"ENSO is a phenomenon resulting from large-scale air-sea inter-
actions (see Chapter 7, Section 7.6.5). ENSO modelling has
advanced considerably since the SAR (e.g., Yukimoto er al., 1996;
Kimoto and Shen, 1997; Knutson et al., 1997; Timmermann et al.,
1998). Some models now use enhanced horizontal resolution in the
tropics to better resolve equatorial ocean dynamics. Models show
SST variability in the tropical Pacific, which has some similarity to
observed ENSO as is shown in upper panels of Figure 8.21.
However, some aspects of ENSO are still not well captured by
present day coupled models (Delecluse et al., 1998). Latif er al.
(1999) analysed the SST climatology and interannual variability
simulated by twenty four models in the equatorial Pacific. When
compared with observations, the models have flaws in reproducing
the annual cycle. About half of the models are characterised by too
weak interannual variability in the eastern equatorial Pacific, while
models generally have larger variability in the central equatorial
Pacific (Table 8.2). It was found that the majority of the models
show the observed ENSO-monsoon relationship, that is, a weak

Indian summer monsoon tends to be associated with El Nifio.

Seasonal forecasting with coupled global models has just
begun (Barnston et al., 1999; McPhaden, 1999), although few of
the models discussed in Chapter 9 are used. While forecast skill of
coupled global models is still lower than statistical models
(Landsea and Knaff, 2000), coupled global models have better
skill than simple models. The 1997 to 1998 El Nifio event
(Trenberth, 1998b) is a good test of coupled model forecast
systems. Figure 8.22 plots the SST anomaly during the 1997 to
1998 El Nifio for predictions made with various initial conditions
by prediction systems at ECMWF (Stockdale et al., 1998), the
Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) (Ishii et al., 1998), NCEP
(Barnston et al., 1999) and for the hindcast made at the Bureau of
Meteorology Research Centre (BMRC) (Wang et al., 2000).
Those comprehensive models predicted unusually warm tropical
Pacific SST for 1997, albeit with underestimation of the strength
of the event and the warming speed. A similar conclusion is
reached with other global climate models (Oberhuber et al., 1998;
Zhou et al., 1998). Unusually strong Madden-Julian Oscillation
(MJO, see Section 8.7.4) and westerly wind bursts may have
affected not only the timing but also the amplitude of the 1997 to
1998 El Nifio (McPhaden, 1999; Moore and Kleeman, 1999), and,
in this respect, models may fail to forecast the onset of an El Nifio
in some circumstances. However, these results suggest an
improved ability of coupled models to forecast El Nifio if
sufficient data to initialise the model are available from a good
ocean data assimilation system.

"The leading mode in the Pacific with decadal time-scale is
usually called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO, see Chapter
2, Section 2.6.3). Unlike the well-documented interannual mode
(ENSO), the decadal pattern does not have a distinctive equato-
rial maximum. Several coupled climate models are able to
reproduce a pattern of this decadal variability broadly similar to
the observed pattern (Latif and Barnett, 1996; Robertson, 1996;
Yukimoto et al., 1996, 2000; Knutson and Manabe, 1998; Yu et
al., 2000a). These modelling groups have proposed different
mechanisms to explain the observed Pacific decadal variability
based on analysis of large samples of simulated decadal
variability in their coupled models. An example is shown in
Figure 8.21b, where larger SST variability in the North Pacific
than in the equatorial region is captured (Yukimoto, 1999). While
the geographical location of the mid-latitude poles and the
amplitude ratio between the tropical and mid-latitude poles vary
slightly from one model to another, pattern correlation between
the observed and model leading decadal EOFs are quite high.

blocking. This was due to reduced systematic error of zonal flow
over the north-eastern Pacific. However, model deficiencies still

any form of systematic extreme event analysis. Intercomparison
of extreme events between models is also made very difficult due

Kaurola (1997) compared the numbers of the observed
extra-tropical storms north of 30°N for five winter seasons and
from a 30-year simulation of the ECHAM3 atmospheric model
for two periods during the control run. The comparisons
indicated that the ratios of total numbers between the simulations
and observations were 0.96 and 0.97 for two respective periods.
It appears that the ECHAM3 model is able to simulate the
numbers of storms north of 30°N in wintertime. The mid-latitude
storm tracks over the North Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and over
the southern circumpolar ocean were also well simulated by the
CCC GCM2 (Zwiers and Kharin, 1998).

Ideally the simulated extreme rainfall should be compared
with grided data calculated from the observed station data;
however, observed grided data comparable to those produced by
the models are scarce. Therefore, often the NCEP/NCAR
reanalysis data are used as an “observed” data set despite the fact
that this data set does not appear to reproduce daily variability
well (Zwiers and Kharin, 1998). Another issue is the interpreta-
tion of precipitation simulated by a climate model, some authors
treat simulated precipitation as grid-box averages; others argue
that it should be treated as grid-point values (Zwiers and Kharin,
1998). Hennessy et al. (1997) compared the daily precipitation
by both CSIRO and UKHI (United Kingdom High-Resolution)
AGCMs coupled to mixed-layer ocean models. They found that
simulated frequencies of daily precipitation were close to those

Several climate model simulations in Table 8.4 have been
analysed using a variety of the above techniques to determine the
frequency of tropical cyclones (Bengtsson et al., 1995; Watterson
et al., 1995; Vitart et al., 1997; Royer et al., 1998). The ECHAM3
model has by far the highest horizontal resolution amongst these
models. The numbers of simulated tropical cyclones are between
70 and 141 per year. The numbers of observed tropical cyclones
per year are quite variable; 80 for the period 1958 to 1977 (Gray,
1979), 99 for the period 1952 to 1971 (Gray, 1975) and 86 for the
period of 1970 to 1995 (Henderson-Sellers et al., 1998). Despite
the differing definitions of tropical cyclones used in the different
analyses, the range of tropical cyclones numbers simulated by the

favourable for cyclogenesis as summarised by Gray (1981). Gray
relates the climatological frequency of tropical cyclone genesis to
six environmental factors: (1) large values of low-level relative
vorticity, (2) Coriolis parameter (at least a few degrees poleward
of the equator), (3) weak vertical shear of the horizontal winds,
(4) high SST’s exceeding 26°C and a deep thermocline, (5)
conditional instability through a deep atmospheric layer, and (6)
large values of relative humidity in the lower and middle
troposphere (Gray, 1981; Henderson-Sellers et al., 1998).
Following the general concepts outlined by Emanuel (1987),
Holland (1997) has derived an alternative thermodynamic
approach to estimate maximum potential intensity of tropical
cyclones. The approach requires an atmosphere sounding, SST,
and surface pressure; it includes the oceanic feedback of
increasing moist entropy associated with falling surface pressure
over a steady SST, and explicitly incorporates a representation of
the cloudy eye wall and a clear eye.

Bengtsson et al. (1995; 1996: 1999) have analysed a five-
year simulation with ECHAM3 at T106 (100 km) horizontal
resolution. They conclude that the model could reproduce some
aspects of the characteristic structure of tropical cyclones and
some aspects of their geographical distribution and seasonal
variability. They also found that in certain areas, in particular in
the north-east Pacific, a realistic number of tropical cyclones was
only generated by the model when the horizontal resolution was
finer than 100 km. Their results showed a reasonably good
agreement with the observed distribution, tracks and annual
variability of tropical cyclones (Bengtsson et al., 1995, 1999).
Sugi et al. (1997) and Yoshimura et al. (1999) used a 100 km
version of the JMA AGCM and compared the simulated
geographical distribution of tropical cyclones with observations.
They obtained reasonably realistic geographical patterns.
However, in contrast to the observations, they did not find a
significant difference in tropical cyclone frequency when they
used the SSTs representing El Nifio and La Nifia years.

Pope et al. (1999) have also illustrated the positive impact of
increased horizontal resolution on the climate of HADAM3. A
number of systematic errors evident at low resolution are reduced
as horizontal resolution is increased from 300 to 100 km.
Improvements are considered to be mainly associated with better
representation of storms. It is apparent that, for some models at
least, neither the regional aspects of a climate simulation nor the
processes that produce them converge over the range of
horizontal resolutions commonly used (e.g., Déqué and
Piedelievre, 1995; Stephenson and Royer, 1995; Williamson et
al., 1995; Stephenson et al., 1998). As part of a European project

dynamical resolution was increased, but the parametrization
resolution held fixed, the local Hadley circulation in the dual-
resolution model simulations converged to a state close to that

increasing resolution when the scale of the physics was held

"The lack of carefully designed systematic intercomparison experi-

features, the typical vertical resolution of around 20 levels is
probably too low, particularly in the atmospheric boundary layer
and near the tropopause. The potential exists for spurious
numerical dispersion, when combined with errors in parametriza-

entropy sources. This suggests that further careful investigation of
model numerics is required as part of a continuing overall
programme of model improvement. The vertical resolution
required in the ocean component is still a matter of judgement and
tends to be governed by available computing resources. There is
still considerable debate on the adequacy of the horizontal resolu-

that some results (those that are reliant on meridional heat
transport) from coupled models with coarse (>1°) resolution
ocean components should be treated cautiously.

Such programmes should include a much more comprehensive

now available to most major modelling centres is such that an
ambitious programme that explores the differing direct responses

"¢ Models tend to underestimate natural climate variability derived
from proxy data over the last few centuries. This may be due tc
missing forcings, but this needs to be explored more systemat-
ically, with a wider range of more recent models.

A reasonable simulation of a limited set of past climate states
(over the past 20,000 years) has been achieved using a range
of climate models, enhancing our confidence in using models
to simulate climates different from the present day.

Our ability to increase confidence in the simulation of land
surface quantities in coupled models is limited by the need fot
significant advances in the simulation of snow, liquid and frozer
soil moisture (and their associated water and energy fluxes).

Coupled model simulations of the palaeo-monsoons produce
better agreement with proxy palaeo-data when vegetation
feedbacks are taken into account; this suggests that vegetatior
changes, both natural and anthropogenic, may need to be
incorporated into coupled models used for climate projections

Models have some skill in simulating ocean ventilation rates.
which are important in transient ocean heat uptake. However
these processes are sensitive to choice of ocean mixing
parametrizations.

Some coupled models now include improved sea-ice
components, but they do not yield systematic improvements
in the sea-ice distributions. This may reflect the impact ot
errors in the simulated near surface wind fields, which offsets
any improvement due to including sea-ice motion.

Some coupled models produce good simulations of the large-
scale heat transport in the coupled atmosphere-ocean system
This appears to be an important factor in achieving good

The following findings from the models analysed in this
chapter corroborate results from the SAR (projections of regional
climate change are given in Chapter 10) for all scenarios consid-
ered. We assign these to be virtually certain to very likely
(defined as agreement among most models, or, where only a
small number of models have been analysed and their results are
physically plausible, these have been assessed to characterise
those from a larger number of models). The more recent results
are generally obtained from models with improved parametriza-
tions (e.g., better land-surface process schemes).

"These estimates are larger than in the SAR, partly as a result
of increases in the radiative forcing, especially the reduced
estimated effects of sulphate aerosols in the second half of the
21st century. By construction, the new range of temperature
responses given above includes the climate model response
uncertainty and the uncertainty of the various future scenarios,
but not the uncertainty associated with the radiative forcings,
particularly aerosol. Note the AOGCM ranges above are 30-year
averages for a period ending at the year 2100 compared to the
average for the period 1961 to 1990, while the results for the
simple model are for temperature changes at the year 2100

A traditional measure . of climate response is equilibrium
climate sensitivity derived from 2xCO), experiments with mixed-
layer models, i.e., Atmospheric General Circulation Models
(AGCMs) coupled to non-dynamic slab oceans, run to equilib-
rium. It has been cited historically to provide a calibration for
models used in climate change experiments. The mean and
standard deviation of this quantity from seventeen mixed-layer
models used in the SAR are +3.8 and +0.8°C, respectively. The
same quantities from fifteen models in active use are +3.5 and
+0.9°C, not significantly different from the values in the SAR.
These quantities are model dependent, and the previous estimated
range for this quantity, widely cited as +1.5 to +4.5°C, still
encompasses the more recent model sensitivity estimates.

regional models which operate on smaller spatial scales. Climate
change simulations are assessed for the period 1990 to 2100 and
are based on a range of scenarios for projected changes in
greenhouse gas concentrations and sulphate aerosol loadings
(direct effect). A few Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation
Model (AOGCM) simulations include the effects of ozone and/or
indirect effects of aerosols (see Table 9.1 for details). Most

"There are many more AOGCM projections of future climate
available than was the case for the IPCC Second Assessment
Report (IPCC, 1996) (hereafter SAR). We concentrate on the
IS92a and draft SRES A2 and B2 scenarios. Some indication of
uncertainty in the projections can be obtained by comparing the
responses among models. The range and ensemble standard
deviation are used as a measure of uncertainty in modelled
response. The simulations are a combination of a forced climate
change component together with internally generated natural
variability. A number of modelling groups have produced
ensembles of simulations where the projected forcing is the same
but where variations in initial conditions result in different
evolutions of the natural variability. Averaging these integrations
preserves the forced climate change signal while averaging out the
natural variability noise, and so gives a better estimate of the
models’ projected climate change.

"A more relevant measure of transient climate change is the
transient climate response (TCR). It is defined as the globally
averaged surface air temperature change for AOGCMs at the time
of CO, doubling in 1%/yr CO, increase experiments. The TCR
combines elements of model sensitivity and factors that affect
response (e.g., ocean heat uptake). It provides a useful measure
for understanding climate system response and allows direct
comparison of global coupled models. The range of TCR for
current AOGCMs is +1.1 to +3.1°C with an average of 1.8°C.
The 1%/yr CO, increase represents the changes in radiative
forcing due to all greenhouse gases, hence this is a higher rate
than is projected for CO, alone. This increase of radiative forcing
lies on the high side of the SRES scenarios (note also that CO,
doubles around mid-21st century in most of the scenarios).
However these experiments are valuable for promoting the

understanding of differences in the model responses.

¢ The range of the TCR is limited by the compensation between
the effective climate sensitivity (ECS) and ocean heat uptake.
For instance, a large ECS, implying a large temperature
change, is offset by a comparatively large heat flux into the
ocean.

It appears that a collapse in the THC by the year 2100 is less
likely than previously discussed in the SAR, based on the
AOGCM results to date.

Beyond 2100, the THC could completely shut-down, possibly
irreversibly, in either hemisphere if the rate of change of
radiative forcing was large enough and applied long enough.
The implications of a complete shut-down of the THC have not
been fully explored.

Although many models show an El Nifio-like change in the mean
state of tropical Pacific SSTs, the cause is uncertain. It has been
related to changes in the cloud radiative forcing and/or evapora-

the full ocean meant that warming at high latitudes was not as

These models corroborated the results in the earlier assessment
regarding the time evolution of warming and the reduced
warming in regions of deep ocean mixing. There were additional
studies of changes in variability in the models in addition to
changes in the mean, and there were more results concerning
possible changes in climate extremes. Information on possible

climate model was used. Combining low emissions with low
sensitivity and high emissions with high sensitivity gave an
extreme range of | to 4.5°C for the warming in the simple model
at the year 2100 (assuming aerosol concentrations constant at
1990-levels). These projections were generally lower than
corresponding projections in IPCC (1990) because of the
inclusion of aerosols in the pre-1990 radiative forcing history.
When the possible effects of future changes of anthropogenic
aerosol as prescribed in the [S92 scenarios were incorporated this
led to lower projections of temperature change of between 1°C
and 3.5°C with the simple model.

"Studies of projections of future climate change use a hierarchy of
coupled ocean/atmosphere/sea-ice/land-surface models to
provide indicators of global response as well as possible regional
patterns of climate change. One type of configuration in this
climate model hierarchy is an Atmospheric General Circulation
Model (AGCM), with equations describing the time evolution of
temperature, winds, precipitation, water vapour and pressure,
coupled to a simple non-dynamic “slab” upper ocean, a layer of
water usually around 50 m thick that calculates only temperature
(sometimes referred to as a “mixed-layer model’’). Such air-sea
coupling allows those models to include a seasonal cycle of solar
radiation. The sea surface temperatures (SSTs) respond to
increases in carbon dioxide (CO,), but there is no ocean
dynamical response to the changing climate. Since the full depth
of the ocean is not included, computing requirements are
relatively modest so these models can be run to equilibrium with
a doubling of atmospheric CO. This model design was prevalent
through the 1980s, and results from such equilibrium simulations
were an early basis of societal concern about the consequences of
increasing CO).

Because SRES was not approved until 15 March 2000, it was
too late for the modelling community to incorporate the scenarios
into their models and have the results available in time for this Third
Assessment Report. Therefore, in accordance with a decision of the
IPCC Bureau in 1998 to release draft scenarios to climate modellers
(for their input to the Third Assessment Report) one marker
scenario was chosen from each of four of the scenario groups based
on the storylines (A1B, A2, B1 and B2) (Box 9.1). The choice of
the markers was based on which initial quantification best reflected
the storyline, and features of specific models. Marker scenarios are
no more or less likely than any other scenarios but these scenarios
have received the closest scrutiny. Scenarios were also selected
later to illustrate the other two scenario groups (A1FI and AIT),
hence there is an illustrative scenario for each of the six scenario
groups. These latter two illustrative scenarios were not selected in
time for AOGCM models to utilise them in this report. In fact,
time and computer resource limitations dictated that most
modelling groups could run only A2 and B2, and results from
those integrations are evaluated in this chapter. However, results
for all six illustrative scenarios are shown here using a simple
climate model discussed below. The IS92a scenario is also used in
a number of the results presented in this chapter in order to
provide direct comparison with the results in the SAR.

"In contrast to the two global coupled climate models in the
1990 Assessment, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
(CMIP) (Meehl et al., 2000a) includes output from about twenty
AOGCMs worldwide, with roughly half of them using flux adjust-
ment. Nineteen of them have been used to perform idealised 1%/yr
CO,-increase climate change experiments suitable for direct
intercomparison and these are analysed here. Roughly half that
number have also been used in more detailed scenario experiments
with time evolutions of forcings including at least CO, and sulphate
aerosols for 20th and 21st century climate. Since there are some
differences in the climate changes simulated by various models
even if the same forcing scenario is used, the models are compared
to assess the uncertainties in the responses. The comparison of 20th
century climate simulations with observations (see Chapter 8) has
given us more confidence in the abilities of the models to simulate
possible future climate changes in the 21st century and reduced the
uncertainty in the model projections (see Chapter 14). The newer
model integrations without flux adjustment give us indications of
how far we have come in removing biases in the model
components. The results from CMIP confirm what was noted in the
SAR in that the basic patterns of climate system response to external
forcing are relatively robust in models with and without flux adjust-
ment (Gregory and Mitchell, 1997; Fanning and Weaver, 1997;

"In 1996, the IPCC began the development of a new set of
emissions scenarios, effectively to update and replace the well-
known IS92 scenarios. The approved new set of scenarios is
described in the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios
(SRES) (Naki¢enovié et al., 2000; see more complete discussion of
SRES scenarios and forcing in Chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6). Four
different narrative storylines were developed to describe consis-
tently the relationships between emission driving forces and their
evolution and to add context for the scenario quantification (see
Box 9.1). The resulting set of forty scenarios (thirty-five of which
contain data on the full range of gases required for climate
modelling) cover a wide range of the main demographic, economic
and technological driving forces of future greenhouse gas and
sulphur emissions. Each scenario represents a specific quantifica-
tion of one of the four storylines. All the scenarios based on the
same storyline constitute a scenario “family”. (See Box 9.1, which
briefly describes the main characteristics of the four SRES
storylines and scenario families.) The SRES scenarios do not
include additional climate initiatives, which means that no
scenarios are included that explicitly assume implementation of the
UNFCCC or the emissions targets of the Kyoto Protocol. However,
greenhouse gas emissions are directly affected by non-climate
change policies designed for a wide range of other purposes.
Furthermore, government policies can, to varying degrees,
influence the greenhouse gas emission drivers and this influence is
broadly reflected in the storylines and resulting scenarios.

each of the four draft and final marker scenarios were studied
using a simple climate model tuned to the AOGCMs used in this

temperature change from the draft and final scenarios are very
similar. The primary difference is a change to the standardised

This results in a higher forcing early in the period. There are
further small differences in net forcing, but these decrease until,
by 2100, differences in temperature change in the two versions of
these scenarios are in the range | to 2%. For the B1 scenario,
however, temperature change is significantly lower in the final

this rate (let alone suddenly remain constant at twice or four times

In earlier assessments, the climate sensitivity was obtained
from calculations made with AGCMs coupled to mixed-layer

case there is no exchange of heat with the deep ocean and a model
can be integrated to a new equilibrium in a few tens of years. For a
full coupled atmosphere/ocean GCM, however, the heat exchange
with the deep ocean delays equilibration and several millennia,
rather than several decades, are required to attain it. This difference
is illustrated in Figure 9.1 where the smooth green curve illustrates
the rapid approach to a new climate equilibrium in an idealised
mixed-layer case while the red curve is the result of a coupled
model integration and indicates the much longer time needed to
attain equilibrium when there is interaction with the deep ocean.

processes that affect energy input, output, and storage in the

increase of CO), is termed the “transient climate response” (TCR)
of the system. This temperature change, indicated in Figure 9.1,
integrates all processes operating in the system, including the
strength of the feedbacks and the rate of heat storage in the ocean,
to give a straightforward measure of model response to a change

aT represents the net effect of processes acting to counteract

equilibrium climate values. A positive forcing will act to increase
the surface temperature and the magnitude of the resulting
increase will depend on the strength of the feedbacks measured by
aT. If @ is large, the temperature change needed to balance a
given change in forcing is small and vice versa. The result will
also depend on the rate of heat storage which is dominated by the
ocean so that dH/dt = dH,/dt = F, where H, is the ocean heat
content and F, is the flux of heat into the ocean. With this approx-
imation the heat budget becomes F = aT + F,, indicating that both
the feedback term and the flux into the ocean act to balance the

6.3.1, the lower value is due mainly to the fact that stratospheric
temperature adjustment was not included in the (previous)
estimates given for the forcing change. It is important to note that
this new radiative forcing estimate does not affect the climate
change and equilibrium climate sensitivity calculations made with
general circulation models. The effect of a change in greenhouse
gas concentration and/or aerosol loading in a general circulation
model (GCM) is calculated internally and interactively based on,

estimates of possible future climate change as discussed in
Section 9.1.2. For the first time we now have a reasonable
number of climate simulations with different forcings so we can
begin to quantify a mean climate response along with a range of

Model response: The ensemble standard deviation and the
range are used as available indications of uncertainty in model
results for a given forcing, although they are by no means a
complete characterisation of the uncertainty. There are a number
of caveats associated with the ensemble approach. Common or
systematic errors in the simulation of current climate (e.g., Gates
et al., 1999; Lambert and Boer, 2001; Chapter 8) survive
ensemble averaging and contribute error to the ensemble mean
while not contributing to the standard deviation. A tendency for

"The impact of uncertainty due to missing or misrepresented
processes can, however, be limited by requiring model simula-
tions to reproduce recent observed climate change. To the extent
that errors are linear (i.e., they have proportionally the same
impact on the past and future changes), it is argued in Chapter 12,
Section 12.4.3.3 that the observed record provides a constraint on
forecast anthropogenic warming rates over the coming decades
that does not depend on any specific model’s climate sensitivity,
rate of ocean heat uptake and (under some scenarios) magnitude
of sulphate forcing and response.

"¢ The first are integrations with idealised forcing, namely, a
1%/yr compound increase of CO). This 1% increase represents
equivalent CO,, which includes other greenhouse gases like
methane, NO, etc. as discussed in Section 9.2.1. These runs
extend at least to the time of effective CO, doubling at year 70,
and are useful for direct model intercomparisons since they use
exactly the same forcing and thus are valuable to calibrate
model response. These experiments are collected in the CMIP
exercise (Meehl er al., 2000a) and referred to as “CMIP2”
(Table 9.1).

"Forcing scenarios: The use of a range of forcing scenarios
reflects uncertainties in future emissions and in the resulting
greenhouse gas concentrations and aerosol loadings in the
atmosphere. The complexity and cost of full AOGCM simulations
has restricted these calculations to a subset of scenarios; these are
listed in Table 9.1 and discussed in Section 9.3.1. Climate projec-
tions for the remaining scenarios are made with less general models
and this introduces a further level of uncertainty. Section 9.3.2
discusses global mean warming for a broad range of scenarios
obtained with simple models calibrated with AOGCMs. Chapter
13 discusses a number of techniques for scaling AOGCM results
from a particular forcing scenario to apply to other scenarios.

Figure 9.3 illustrates some basic aspects of the multi-model
ensemble approach for global mean temperature and precipita-
tion. Each model result is the sum of a smooth forced signal, T;
and the accompanying natural variability noise. The natural
variability is different for each model and tends to average out so
that the ensemble mean estimates the smooth forced signal. The
scatter of results about the ensemble mean (measured by the
ensemble variance) is an indication of uncertainty in the results
and is seen to increase with time. Global mean temperature is
seen to be a more robust climate change variable than precipita-
tion in the sense that {AT} / O,y is larger than {AP} / O,p. These
results are discussed further in Section 9.3.2.

Missing or misrepresented physics: No attempt has been
made to quantify the uncertainty in model projections of climate
change due to missing or misrepresented physics. Current models
attempt to include the dominant physical processes that govern
the behaviour and the response of the climate system to specified
forcing scenarios. Studies of “missing” processes are often
carried out, for instance of the effect of aerosols on cloud
lifetimes, but until the results are well-founded, of appreciable
magnitude, and robust in a range of models, they are considered
to be studies of sensitivity rather than projections of climate
change. Physical processes which are misrepresented in one or
more, but not all, models will give rise to differences which will
be reflected in the ensemble standard deviation.

"and Boer (2001) show that for the CMIP1 ensemble of simula-
tions of current climate, the multi-model ensemble means of
temperature, pressure, and precipitation are generally closer to
the observed distributions, as measured by mean squared differ-
ences, correlations, and variance ratios, than are the results of any
particular model. The multi-model ensemble mean represents
those features of projected climate change that survive ensemble
averaging and so are common to models as a group. The multi-
model ensemble variance, assuming no correlation between the
forced and variability components, is 62,7 = 07 + 07x, where
O°u = {(Tm — {Tm})?} measures the inter-model scatter of the
forced component and 67y the natural variability. The common
signal is again best discerned where the signal to noise ratio {AT}
/ Ogr is largest.

Figure 9.3 shows the global average temperature and precipitation
changes for the nineteen CMIP2 simulations. At the time of CO,
doubling at year 70, the 20-year average (years 61 to 80) global
mean temperature change (the transient climate response TCR;
see Section 9.2) for these models is 1.1 to 3.1°C with an average
of 1.8°C and a standard deviation of 0.4°C (Figure 9.7). This is
similar to the SAR results (Figure 6. 4 in Kattenberg et al., 1996).

"¢ A second category of AOGCM climate model simulations
uses specified time-evolving future forcing where the simula-
tions start sometime in the 19th century, and are run with
estimates of observed forcing through the 20th century (see
Chapter 8). That state is subsequently used to begin simula-
tions of the future climate with estimated forcings of
greenhouse gases (“G”) or with the additional contribution
from the direct effect of sulphate aerosols (“GS”) according
to various scenarios, such as IS92a (see Chapter 1). These
simulations avoid the cold start problem (see SAR) present in
the CMIP experiments. They allow evaluation of the model
climate and response to forcing changes that could be experi-
enced over the 21st century. The experiments are collected in
the IPCC-DDC. These experiments are assessed for the mid-
21st century when most of the DDC experiments with
sulphate aerosols finished.

level of the tropopause among the models. Ocean heat uptake
also contributes to a minimum of warming in the North Atlantic,
while land warms more rapidly than ocean almost everywhere
(Figure 9.10). The large warming in high latitudes of the
Northern Hemisphere is connected with a reduction in the snow

There is relatively good agreement between the models for
the lower latitude response, with larger range and less certain
response at higher latitudes (Figure 9.10). For example, most
models show a minimum of warming somewhere in the North
Atlantic but the location is quite variable. There is a tendency for
more warming (roughly a degree) in the tropical central and east
Pacific than in the west, though this east-west difference in
warming is generally less than a degree in the multi-model
ensemble and is not evident with the contour interval in Figure
9.10 except in the B2 experiment in Figure 9.10e. This El Nino-
like response is discussed further in Section 9.3.5.2.

The SRES. AQ and B2 integrations (Figure 9.10d,e) show a
similar pattern of temperature change as the CMIP2 and G
experiments. Since the positive radiative forcing from
greenhouse gases overwhelms the sulphate aerosol forcing at the
end of the 21st century in A2 and B2 compared to the GS experi-
ments at mid-21st century, the patterns resemble more closely the
G simulations in Figure 9.10a,b. The amplitude of the climate
change patterns is weaker for the B2 than for the A2 simulations
at the end of the 21st century (Figure 9.10d. 2).

Other manifestations of the changes in precipitation are
reported by Noda and Tokioka (1989), Murphy and Mitchell
(1995) and Royer et al. (1998) who found an increase in the
global mean convective rain rate in the 2xCO, climate compared
with the 1xCOQ, climate. Results from another model (Brinkop,
2001; see also Cubasch et al., 1999) indicate a decrease in global
mean convective precipitation. Essentially the results of Brinkop
are consistent with Murphy and Mitchell, because in both
transient climate simulations the strongest reduction in convec-
tive rain is found in the sub-tropics, and is most pronounced in
the Southern Hemisphere. The increase in convective rain rate in
the Northern Hemisphere is less strong in Brinkop compared to
"	Text
"discussed in Chapter 10). This regional effect was noted in the
SAR for only two models, but Figure 9.10c shows this is a
consistent response across the greater number of more recent
models. The GS experiments only include the direct effect of
sulphate aerosols, but two model studies have included the
direct and indirect effect of sulphate aerosols and show roughly
the same pattern (Meehl et al., 1996; Roeckner et al., 1999).
The simulations performed with and without the direct sulphate
effect (GS and G, respectively) with the same model are more
similar to each other than to the other models, indicating that
the individual response characteristics of the various models are
dominating the response pattern rather than differences in the
forcing. With greater CO, forcing, the simulated patterns are
more highly correlated in the G simulations than in the GS
simulations (Table 9.2, 26 of 36 possible model combinations
for temperature, 22 of 36 for precipitation).

"Africa and south Asia) and the mid- and high latitudes, while the
rainfall generally decreases in the sub-tropical belts. These
changes are more evident for larger positive radiative forcing in
the A2 and B2 scenario runs at the end of the 21st century
(Figure 9.11d,e). This also applies to the areas of decrease that
show a high inter-model variability and therefore little consis-
tency among models, while in the tropics the change can exceed
the variability of the signal by a factor of 2. This is particularly
evident over the central and eastern tropical Pacific where the El
Nifio-like surface temperature warming is associated with an
eastward shift of positive precipitation anomalies. The A2 and
B2 scenario experiments exhibit a relatively large increase in
precipitation over the Sahara and Arabia, but with large inter-
model variability. This is partly an artefact of using percentage
change rather than absolute values, since in these regions the
absolute precipitation amount is very small.

The most consistent feature in the ensemble mean sea level
pressure difference (Figure 9.12) is a decrease in the sea level
pressure at high latitudes and an increase at mid-latitudes. In
studies of the the Southern Hemisphere, this is related to a
combination of changes in surface and mid-tropospheric temper-
ature gradients (Raisinen, 1997; Fyfe et al., 1999; Kushner et al.,
2001). Over wide regions of the Southern Hemisphere and
Northern Hemisphere high latitudes, the ensemble mean signal
generally exceeds the ensemble standard deviation indicating a
consistent response across the models. For the A2 and B2
scenarios this is also found. Additionally a lowering of pressure
can be found over the Sahara, probably due to thermal effects.
The lowering of pressure is consistent across the A2 and B2
simulations.

The calculation of radiative forcing from the SRES emission
scenarios for the temperature projections presented here follows
closely that described in Chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6, with some
exceptions as described below. Further details of the forcing for
the collective procedures (MAGICC model) are given by Wigley
(2000). Atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases are
calculated from the emissions using gas cycle models. For CO),
the model of Wigley (1993) is used and as described therein, the
CO, fertilisation factor is adjusted to give a balanced 1980s mean
budget. To be consistent with Chapter 3, climate feedbacks are
included and the model has been tuned to give results that are
similar to those of the Bern-CC and ISAM models for a climate
sensitivity of 2.5°C (Chapter 3, Figure 3.12). The strength of the
climate feedbacks on the carbon cycle are very uncertain, but
models show they are in the direction of greater temperature
change giving greater atmospheric CO, concentration. The
climate feedbacks in the Bern-CC model are greater than those of
the ISAM model and the feedback strength used here is about
half as big as that in the ISAM model. The gas cycle models for
CH, and N,O and the other trace gases are identical to those used
in Chapter 4. The concentrations for the main greenhouse gases
for the six SRES scenarios are shown in Chapter 4, Figure 4.14.

"This section investigates the range of future global mean tempera-

scenarios with complete greenhouse gas emissions (Naki¢enovié¢ et

uncertainty due to the differences in the response of several
AOGCMs. Forcing uncertainties are not considered in these
calculations. As well as envelope results that incorporate all the
SRES scenarios, six specific SRES scenarios are considered. These
are the four illustrative marker scenarios A1B, A2, B1 and B2 and
two further illustrative scenarios from the Al family representing
different energy technology options; A1FI and A1T (see Section
9.3.1.3 and Box 9.1). For comparison, results are also shown for
some of the IS92 scenarios. As discussed in Section 9.3.1.3 some
AOGCMs have run experiments with some or all of the four draft

implications of the full range of the final SRES scenarios, a simple
climate model is used as a tool to simulate the AOGCM results
(Wigley and Raper, 1992; Raper et al., 1996, 2001a). The tuning of
the simple model to emulate the different AOGCM results is

reactive gases CO, NNVOCs, and NO, (Nakicenovié et al., 2000).
To facilitate the calculations, the MiniCAM modelling team
provided emissions paths for these gases.

Estimated total historical anthropogenic radiative forcing
from 1765 to 1990 followed by forcing resulting from the six
illustrative SRES scenarios are both shown in Figure 9.13a. It is
evident that the six SRES scenarios considered cover nearly the
full range of forcing that results from the full set of SRES
scenarios. The latter is shown on figure 9.13a as an envelope
since the forcing resulting from individual scenarios cross with
time. For comparison, radiative forcing is also shown for the

forcing for the new SRES scenarios is wider and higher than in
the IS92 scenarios. The range is wider due to more variation in
emissions of non-CO, greenhouse gases. The shift to higher
forcing is mainly due to the reduced future sulphur dioxide

Figure 9.13b shows the simple climate model simulations
representing AOGCM-calibrated global mean temperature
change results for the six illustrative SRES scenarios and for the
full SRES scenario envelopes. The individual scenario time-
series and inner envelope (darker shading) are the average results
obtained from simulating the results of seven AOGCMs, denoted
“ensemble”. The average of the effective climate sensitivity of
these AOGCMs is 2.8°C (see Appendix 9.1). The range of global
mean temperature change from 1990 to 2100 given by the six
illustrative scenarios for the ensemble is 2.0 to 4.5°C (see Figure
9.14). The range for the six illustrative scenarios encompassing
the results calibrated to the DOE PCM and GFDL_RI5_a
AOGCM parameter settings is 1.4 to 5.6°C. These two AOGCMs
have effective climate sensitivities of 1.7 and 4.2°C, respectively
(see Table 9.1). The range for these two parameter settings for the
full set of SRES scenarios is 1.4 to 5.8°C. Note that this is not the
extreme range of possibilities, for two reasons. First, forcing
uncertainties have not been considered. Second, some AOGCMs
have effective climate sensitivities outside the range considered
(see Table 9.1). For example, inclusion of the simple model’s
representation of the CCSR/NIES2 AOGCM would increase the
high end of the range by several degrees C.

important to note differences that would result from the use of the
final SRES scenarios. Based on a comparison using the simple
climate model, the final scenarios for the three markers A1B, A2
and B2 give temperature changes that are slightly smaller than
those of the draft scenarios (Smith er al., 2001). The main differ-
ence is a change in the standardised values for 1990 through
2000, which are common to all these scenarios. This results in
higher forcing early in the period. There are further small differ-
ences in net forcing, but these decrease until, by 2100, differences
in temperature change in the two versions of these scenarios are
only | to 2%. For the B1 scenario, however, temperature changes
are significantly lower in the final version. The difference is
almost 20% in 2100, as a result of generally lower emissions
across the whole range of greenhouse gases.

A second feature of the illustrative SRES scenarios is that
their relative ranking in terms of global mean temperature
changes varies with time (Wigley, 1999; Smith et al. 2001). The
temperature-change values of the scenarios cross in about mid-
century because of links between the emissions of different
gases. In particular, for scenarios with higher fossil fuel use, and
therefore carbon dioxide emissions (for example A2), sulphur
dioxide emissions are also higher. In the near term (to around
2050) the cooling effect of higher sulphur dioxide emissions
more than offsets the warming caused by increased emissions of
greenhouse gases in scenarios such as A2. The effect of the high
sulphur dioxide emissions in the IS92a scenario is similar. It
causes IS92a to give rise to a lower 2030 temperature than any of
the specific SRES scenarios considered (Figure 9.15a). The
opposite effect is seen for scenarios B1 and B2, which have lower
fossil fuel emissions, but also lower sulphur dioxide emissions.
This leads to a larger near-term warming. In the longer term,
however, the level of emissions of long-lived greenhouse gases
such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide becomes the dominant

In order to define future radiative forcings fully, it is
necessary to make assumptions about how the emissions or
concentrations of the other gases may change in the future. In
addition, it is necessary to have a base scenario against which
the effect of the different stabilisation pathways may be
assessed. The state of the science at present is such that it is
only possible to give illustrative examples of possible outcomes
(Wigley et al., 1996; Schimel et al., 1997; Mitchell et al.,

Considering the six illustrative scenarios, the bars on the
right-hand side of Figure 9.14 show that scenarios A1FI and B1
alone, define the top and bottom of the range of projected temper-
ature changes, respectively. Towards the middle of the range the
scenario bars overlap, indicating that most of the projections fall
within this region. In the corresponding sea level rise figure,
because of the greater intertia in the ocean response, there is a
greater overlap in the projected response to the various scenarios
(see Chapter 11, Figure 11.12). In addition, the sea level range for
a given scenario is broadened by inclusion of uncertainty in land

are also in good agreement with observed carbon dioxide
concentrations up to 1999. Corresponding stabilisation profiles
for the other greenhouses gases have not yet been produced. To
illustrate the effect on temperature of earlier reductions in

"To produce these examples, the SRES scenario A1B is used
as the base scenario. CO, concentrations for this scenario are
close to the WRE CO, profiles in terms of their implied past and
near-future values, so our choice satisfies the underlying WRE
assumption that emissions should initially follow a baseline
trajectory. This is not the case for the S profiles, however,
because as pointed out above, present day CO, concentrations
already exceed the values assumed for the S profiles. Note that
the baseline scenario (A1B) is specified only out to 2100. For
stabilisation cases, emissions of non-CO, gases are assumed to
follow the A1B scenario out to 2100 and are thereafter held
constant at their year 2100 level. For scenario A1B, this
assumption of constant emissions from 2100 leads to stabilisa-
tion of the other gas concentrations at values close to their 2100
values. For gases with long lifetimes (such as NO) it takes
centuries to reach stabilisation. In all cases, however, the net
radiative forcing changes for the non-CO, gases are small after
2100 and negligible after about 2200. Note that, in comparing
the baseline case with the various stabilisation cases, the only
gas that changes is CO).

"By 2100, the differences in the surface air temperature
response across the group of climate models forced with a given
scenario is as large as the range obtained by a single model forced
with the different SRES scenarios (Figure 9.15). Given the quasi-
linear nature of the simple model, projections which go outside
the range as yet explored by AOGCMs must be treated with
caution, since non-linear effects may come into play. Further
uncertainties arise due to uncertainties in the radiative forcing.
The uncertainty in sulphate aerosol forcing is generally charac-
terised in terms of the 1990 radiative forcing. Wigley and Smith
(1998) and Smith et al. (2001) examined the effect of this
uncertainty on future temperature change by varying the assumed
1990 sulphate radiative forcing by 0.6 Wm” above and below a
central value of —1.1 Wm-?. Reducing the sulphate forcing
increased the 1990 to 2100 warming by 0 to 7% (depending on
the scenario), while increasing the sulphate forcing decreased
warming over the next century by a similar amount. The
sensitivity to the uncertainty in sulphate forcing was found to be
significantly less in the new scenarios than in the IS92a scenario;
in the latter the sensitivity to sulphate forcing was twice as large
as the largest value for the SRES marker scenarios. Therefore, the
smaller future emissions of sulphur dioxide in the new scenarios
significantly lowers the uncertainty in future global mean temper-
ature change due to the uncertain value of present day sulphate
aerosol forcing. The climate effects described here use the SRES
scenarios as contained in Nakicenovié er al. (2000). Any
feedbacks on the socio-economic development path, and hence
on emissions, as a result of these climate changes have not been
included.

Since sulphur dioxide emissions stabilise at 2100, the
forcing from sulphate aerosols is constant thereafter. CH,
concentrations stabilise before 2200, and the forcing change
from N,O concentration changes after 2200 is less than 0.1
Wm~. The continued increase in temperature after the time of
CO, stabilisation (Figure 9.16) is in part due to the later stabil-
isation of the other gases but is primarily due to the inertia in
the climate system which requires several centuries to come
into equilibrium with a particular forcing.

"Only one AOGCM study has considered the regional
effects of stabilising CO, concentrations (Mitchell et al., 2000).
HadCM2, which has an effective climate sensitivity in the
middle of the IPCC range (Table 9.1), was run with the S550
ppm and S750 ppm stabilisation profiles (“S profiles”; Enting et
al., 1994; Schimel er al., 1997). Simulations with a simple
climate model (Schimel et al., 1997) indicate that the global
mean temperature response in these profiles is likely to differ by
no more than about 0.2°C from the equivalent WRE profiles
(Wigley et al., 1996; see Figure 9.16), though the maximum rate
of temperature change is likely to be lower with the S profiles.
Global mean changes in the AOGCM experiments are similar to
those in Schimel et al. (1994). Note that the AOGCM experi-
ments consider stabilisation of CO, concentrations only, and do
not take into account changes in other gases, effectively
assuming that concentrations of other gases are stabilised
immediately. To allow for ongoing increases in other greenhouse
gases, one would have in practice to reduce CO) to even lower
levels to obtain the same level of climate change. For example,
in the IS92a scenario, other trace gases contribute 1.3 Wm to
the radiative forcing by 2100. If the emissions of these gases
were to continue to increase as in the IS92a scenario, then CO
levels would have to be reduced by about 95 ppm to maintain the
same level of climate change in these experiments.

A variety of feedback processes operate in the climate system
(Chapter 7) to determine the response to changes in radiative
forcing. The climate sensitivity (see Section 9.2.1) is a broad
measure of this response. Ideally, a coupled AOGCM’s climate
sensitivity would be obtained by integrating the model to a new
climate equilibrium after doubling the CO, concentration in the
model atmosphere. Since this requires a lengthy integration,
climate sensitivities are usually estimated with atmospheric
GCMs coupled to mixed-layer upper ocean models, for which the
new equilibrium is obtained in decades rather than millennia.
Equilibrium climate sensitivities for models in current use are
compared with the results reported in the SAR. A related
measure, the effective climate sensitivity, is obtained from non-

effective climate sensitivity from several experiments with
different versions of an AOGCM. The results show considerable
variability, particularly near the beginning of the integrations when
the temperature change is small. That study nevertheless
concludes that the effective climate sensitivity is approximately
constant and close to the appropriate equilibrium result. However,
estimates of effective climate sensitivity obtained from the
HadCM2 model range from about 2.7°C at the time of stabilisa-
tion at 2xCO, to about 3.8°C after 900 years (Raper ef al., 2001a).
Senior and Mitchell (2000) implicate time-dependent cloud-
feedbacks associated with the slower warming of the Southern
Ocean in that model as the cause for this variation in time. The
effective climate sensitivity of this climate model is initially
considerably smaller than the equilibrium sensitivity obtained with
a mixed-layer ocean. As the coupled model integration approaches
a new equilibrium, the effective climate sensitivity increases and
appears to be approaching the equilibrium climate sensitivity.

The climate sensitivity is a basic measure of the response of the
climate system to a change in forcing. It may be measured in
several ways as discussed above. The equilibrium climate
sensitivity, that is, the range of the surface air temperature
response to a doubling of the atmospheric CO, concentration,
was estimated to be between 1.5 and 4.5°C in the SAR
(Kattenberg et al., 1996). That range still encompasses the
estimates from the current models in active use.

Earlier (Section 9.3.1), it was noted that the climate response
varies from model to model even when the radiative forcing used
to drive the models is similar. This difference in the climate
models’ response is mainly the result of differing climate
sensitivities and differing rates of heat uptake by the oceans in
each model, although differences in the AOGCM radiative
forcing for a given CO) concentration also have a small effect
(see Chapter 6, Section 6.3).

"weakening varied from model to model, but in some cases it was
noted that the THC in the North Atlantic stopped completely

THC in the Atlantic Ocean results in a reduction of the poleward
heat transport that in turn leads to a minimum in the surface
warming in the northern North Atlantic Ocean and/or in the
circumpolar Ocean (see Section 9.3.2). The reduction in the
warming in the North Atlantic region touches the extreme north-
eastern part of North America and north-west Europe. The
shutting off of the THC in either hemisphere could have long-term
implications for climate. However, even in models where the THC
weakens, there is still a warming over Europe. For example, in all
AOGCM integrations where the radiative forcing is increasing,
the sign of the temperature change over north-west Europe is
positive (see Figure 9. 10).

Stocker and Schmittner (1997), using an intermediate
complexity model, found that the North Atlantic THC shut-down
when the rate of 1%/yr of CO} increase was held fixed for approx-
imately 100 years. This is in agreement with the earlier AOGCM
study of Manabe and Stouffer (1994), where the THC shut-down
in an integration where the CO, concentration increased by 1%/yr
to four times its initial value. In integrations where the CO,
stabilised at doubling, the THC did not shut-down in either study
(Stocker and Schmittner 1997; Manabe and Stouffer 1994).
Furthermore, in the Manabe and Stouffer (1994) AOGCM where
the CO, is stabilised at four times its normal value, the THC
recovers to the control integration value around model year 2300.
A recent study (Stouffer and Manabe, 1999) found that the
amount of weakening of the THC by the time of CO, doubling is
a function of the rate of CO, increase and not the absolute increase
in the radiative forcing. They found the slower the rate of increase,
the more the weakening of the THC by the time of CO, doubling.

Figure 9.21 shows a comparison of the strength of the THC
through a number of transient experiments with various models
and warming scenarios over the 21st century. The initial (control
state) absolute strength of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation
(THC) varies by more than a factor of 2 between the models,
ranging from 10 to 30 Sv (1 Sv = 10° m3s~!). The cause of this
wide variation is unclear, but it must involve the sub-grid parame-
trization schemes used for mixing in the oceans (Bryan, 1987) and
differences in the changes of the surface fluxes. The sensitivity of
the THC to changes in the radiative forcing is also quite different
between the models. Generally as the radiative forcing increases,
most models show a reduction of THC. However, some models
show only a small weakening of the THC and one model
(ECHAM4/OPYC; Latif et al., 2000) has no weakening in
response to increasing greenhouse gases, as does the NCAR CSM
as documented by Gent (2001). The exact reasons for the differ-
ence in the THC responses are unknown, but the role of the
surface fluxes is certainly part of the reasons for the differences in
the response (see below).

"The effective climate sensitivity and ocean heat uptake are
compared by Raper ef al. (2001b) using the CMIP2 data set
(1%/yr CO) increase to doubling). The effective climate sensitiv-
ities around the time of CO, doubling (average for the years 61 to
80), when the signal is strongest, agree reasonably well with the
mixed-layer equilibrium climate sensitivities given in Figure 9.20.
Results are shown for various models in Figure 9.20 It is evident
that the models with high effective climate sensitivity also tend to
have a large net heat flux into the ocean. This oceanic heat flux
causes a delay in the climate response. The relationship between
the effective climate sensitivity and the oceanic heat uptake was
first described by Hansen et al. (1984, 1985) using a box diffusion
model. Raper et al. (2001b) show that an additional ocean-
feedback is possibly associated with the warming and freshening
of the high latitude surface waters that enhances this relationship.
Details of the individual model’s sub-grid scale parametrizations
also affect both the effective climate sensitivity and the oceanic
heat uptake (Weaver and Wiebe, 1999). The evident relationship
between effective climate sensitivity and ocean heat uptake leads
to the transient climate response (TCR) having a smaller spread
among the model results than the climate models’ climate
sensitivity alone would suggest (see Section 9.3.1). Since the
oceanic heat uptake is directly related to the thermal expansion,
the range for thermal expansion is correspondingly increased due
to the compensation noted above (see Chapter 11 for a complete
discussion of sea level rise).

SAR is a transient increase of greenhouse gases throughout the
integration. In the model integrations presented in this section, the
CO) concentration increases up to a certain value (e.g., a doubling
of the CO, concentration) and then remains constant for the
remainder of the integration. Since this type of integration involves
integrating the model for very long time periods (at least several
centuries) only a few integrations have been performed using
AOGCMs. Furthermore, no standard emission scenarios have been
used for forcing these model runs and most have used idealised

Finally, it is important to note that the transient THC response
(ie., the weakening) is quite different from the equilibrium
response of the THC (i.e., little change). This fact makes the

Even after the radiative forcing becomes constant, the surface
air temperature continues to increase for many centuries (Figure
9.19) as noted in Section 9.3.4.1. The rate of warming after stabil-
isation is relatively small (<0.3°C per century, Figure 9.19b);
however, the total warming after the radiative forcing stabilises can
be significant (more than 1°C) because the warming continues for
a long time period (Figure 9.19b). From Figure 9.19, one notes that
the rate of warming after stabilisation varies from model to model.

"The time rate of change in the radiative forcing also affects
both the weakening and recovery of the THC (Figure 9.25). In the
GFDL_R15_a model when the CO, increased at a rate of 1%/yr to
doubling, the THC continued to weaken for 70 years after the point
at which the CO, was held constant at the doubled value (year 70).
Ina second integration, the CO, increased at a rate of 0.25%/yr to
doubling. In this integration, the THC does not weaken after the
doubling point (Manabe and Stouffer, 1994), indicating that the
behaviour of the THC response is highly dependent on the rate that
the radiative forcing changes (Figure 9.25).

The thermohaline circulation (THC) response is more
complex than that of the surface air temperature in the stablisation
integrations (compare Figure 9.19a with Figure 9.25, for example).
Typically the THC weakens as the radiative forcing increases
(Section 9.3.4.3). After the radiative forcing stabilises, the THC
recovers to its control integration value. The initial weakening is
caused by the warming of the mixed layer in the ocean and the
increase in the freshwater flux in high latitudes. As the radiative
forcing stablises, the tendency for the surface fluxes to weaken the
THC is balanced by the changes in the ocean heat and water
transports and vertical structure. It is found that the time-scale for
this recovery varies from model to model (about a century to multi-
centuries). Again it is likely that differences in the oceanic mixing
are the cause for the differences in the recovery time.

"The slow rate of surface air temperature increase occurs as
the heat anomaly slowly penetrates to depth in the ocean (Figure
9.23). The rate of penetration is dependent on the model’s vertical
mixing both resolved by the model’s grid and by the sub-grid scale
parametrizations. The effect of the oceanic mixing parametriza-
tions on the coupled model response has been investigated using
climate models of intermediate complexity (Figure 9.24):

response of the global mean surface air temperature, thermal
expansion (see Chapter 11, Section 11.5.4.1 for a more complete
discussion) and THC can be seen by comparing the results
obtained from Stocker’s (Bern 2.5) models and the Uvic models
(Weaver and Wiebe, 1999). The sub-grid scale mixing para-
metrizations vary in the AOGCMs, accounting for much of the

An expanding area of research since the SAR is the consid-
eration of whether climate change may be realised as preferred
modes of non-linear naturally occurring atmospheric circulation
patterns, or so-called weather regimes as proposed by Palmer
(1999). Recent work (e.g., Hurrell 1995, 1996; Thompson and
Wallace 1998; Corti et al., 1999) has suggested that the observed
warming over the last few decades may be manifest as a change
in frequency of these naturally preferred patterns (Chapters 2 and
7) and there is now considerable interest in testing the ability of
climate models to simulate such weather regimes (Chapter 8) and
to see whether the greenhouse gas forced runs suggest shifts in
the residence time or transitions between such regimes on long
time-scales. There are now several multi-ensemble simulations
using scenarios of time-evolving forcing and multi-century
experiments with stabilised forcing, which may help to separate
the noise of decadal variability from the signal of climate change.

"Changes in daily variability of temperature and rainfall are most
obviously manifest in changes in extreme events and much of the
work in this area will be discussed in the extreme events section
(Section 9.3.6). However, changes in short time-scale variability do
not necessarily only imply changes in extreme weather. More
subtle changes in daily variability, when integrated over time,
could still have important socio-economic impacts. Hennessey et
al. (1997) found that the simulated number of wet days (days
where the rainfall is non-zero) in two mixed-layer models went
down in mid-latitudes and up in high latitudes when CO, was
doubled, whilst the mean precipitation increased in both areas. The
global mean precipitation also increased, by around 10% in both
models, typical of the changes in many mixed-layer models on
doubling CO. An analysis of changes in daily precipitation
variability in a coupled model (Durman et al., 2001) suggests a
similar reduction in wet days over Europe where the increase in
precipitation efficiency exceeds the increase in mean precipitation.

"with the running of multi-century experiments and multi-member
ensembles of integrations for a given climate forcing (Section
9.2). There have been a number of studies that have considered
changes in interannual variability under climate change (e.g.,
Knutson and Manabe, 1994; Knutson er al., 1997; Tett et al.
1997; Timmermann ef al. 1999; Boer et al. 2000b; Collins,
2000a,b). Other studies have looked at intra-seasonal variability
in coupled models and the simulation of changes in mid-latitude
storm tracks (e.g., Carnell et al. 1996; Lunkeit er al., 1996;
Carnell and Senior, 1998; Ulbrich and Christoph, 1999), tropical

Wang, 1997; Carnell and Senior, 1998). The results from these

the full complexity of these structures, due in part to the coarse
resolution in both the atmosphere and oceans of the majority of
the models used (Chapter 8).

"Aattenberg ef al. (1776) reported research on changes 1n inter-
monthly temperatures and precipitation variability from two
coupled models (Meehl et al, 1994; Parey, 1994). More recently,
there have been several studies looking at changes in intra-
seasonal circulation patterns using higher resolution atmosphere-
only models with projected SSTs taken from coupled models at
given time periods in the future (e.g., Beersma et al., 1997;
Schubert ef al., 1998). The effects of changes in extra-tropical
storms on extreme wind and precipitation events are described in
Section 9.3.6, but there has also been work on changes in lower-
frequency variability such as persistent or “blocking” anti-
cyclones. As discussed in the SAR, there still seems to be little
consensus on the methodology for looking at changes in storms
and blocks and it is likely that this is partly the reason for the lack
of consistency in results. In new studies, Lupo et al. (1997)
looked at the effect of doubled CO, on several of the characteris-
tics of blocking. They found an increase in the number of
continental blocks and a general increase in the persistence of
blocks, but with weakened amplitude. In contrast, Carnell and
Senior (1998) found the largest change was a decrease in
blocking in the North Pacific Ocean in winter in their model.
Earlier studies have pointed to the possible model dependency of
results (Bates and Meehl, 1986) and Carnell and Senior (2000)
suggest that the changes in blocking found in their earlier study
(Carnell and Senior, 1998) may depend on the meridional
gradient of temperature change in the model, which may in turn
depend on the simulation of cloud feedback in their model.

Firstly, will the long-term mean Pacific SSTs shift toward a
more El Nifio-like or La Nifia-like regime? Since 1995, the
analyses of several global climate models indicate that as global
temperatures increase due to increased greenhouse gases, the
Pacific climate will tend to resemble a more El Nifio-like state
(Knutson and Manabe, 1995; Mitchell er al., 1995; Meehl and
Washington, 1996; Timmermann ef al., 1999; Boer et al.,
2000b). However, the reasons for such a response are varied, and
could depend on the model representation of cloud feedback
(Senior, 1999; Meehl er al., 2000b); the quality of the
unperturbed El Nifio state in the models (Chapter 8) or the
stronger evaporative damping of the warming in the warm pool
region, relative to the eastern Pacific due to the non-linear
Clausius-Clapeyron relationship between temperature and
saturation mixing ratios (e.g., Knutson and Manabe, 1995).
Additionally, a different coupled model (Noda et al., 1999b)
shows a La Nijfia-like response and yet another model shows an
initial La Nifia-like pattern which becomes an El Nifio-like
pattern due to subducted warmed extra-tropical water that
penetrates through the sub-tropics into the tropics (Cai and
Whetton, 2000). A possible reason for the La Nifia-like response
has been suggested in a simple coupled model study where the
dominant role of ocean dynamics in the heat balance over the
tropical Pacific is seen for a specified uniform positive forcing
across the Pacific basin (Cane et al., 1997).

The effect of sulphate aerosols on Indian summer monsoon
precipitation is to dampen the strength of the monsoon compared
to that seen with greenhouse gases only (Lal et al., 1995; Cubasch
et al., 1996; Meehl et al., 1996; Mitchell and Johns 1997; Roeckner
et al., 1999), reinforcing preliminary findings in the SAR. The
pattern of response to the combined forcing is at least partly
dependent on the land-sea distribution of the aerosol forcing, which
in turn may depend upon the relative size of the direct and indirect
effects (e.g., Meehl et al., 1996; Roeckner et al., 1999). There is
still considerable uncertainty in these forcings (Chapter 6). To
date, the effect of aerosol forcing (direct and indirect) on the
variability of of the monsoon has not been investigated.

Finally, how will ENSO’ s impact on weather in the Pacific
Basin and other parts of the world change? Meehl et al. (1993)
and Meehl and Washington (1996) indicate that future seasonal
precipitation extremes associated with a given ENSO event are
likely to be more intense due to the warmer, more El Nifio-like,
mean base state in a future climate. That is, for the tropical Pacific
and Indian Ocean regions, anomalously wet areas could become
wetter and anomalously dry areas become drier during future
ENSO events. Also, in association with changes in the extra-
tropical base state in a future warmer climate, the teleconnections
to mid-latitudes, particularly over North America, may shift
somewhat with an associated shift of precipitation and drought
conditions in future ENSO events (Meehl et al., 1993).

When assessing changes in ENSO, it must be recognised
that an “El Nifio-like” pattern can apparently occur at a variety of
time-scales ranging from interannual to inter-decadal (Zhang et
al., 1997), either without any change in forcing or as a response
to external forcings such as increased CO, (Meehl and
Washington, 1996; Knutson and Manabe, 1998; Noda et al.,
1999a,b; Boer et al., 2000b; Meehl ef al., 2000b). Making
conclusions about “changes” in future ENSO events will be
complicated by these factors. Additionally, since substantial
internally generated variability of ENSO statistics on multi-
decadal to century time-scales occurs in long unforced climate
model simulations (Knutson er al., 1997), the attribution of past
and future changes in ENSO amplitude and frequency to external
forcing may be quite difficult, perhaps requiring extensive use of
ensemble climate experiments or long experiments with
stabilised forcing (e.g., Knutson et al., 1997).

A few studies have attempted to look at model-simulated changes
in modes of low-frequency variability due to anthropogenic
climate change. Particular attention has focused on changes in
ENSO as reported in the SAR and in Section 9.3.5.2, and the AO
or NAO and AAO which are prominent features of low-frequency
variability in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, respec-
tively (e.g., Fyfe et al., 1999; Osborn et al., 1999; Paeth er al.,
1999; Shindell et al., 1999; Ulbrich and Christoph, 1999; Zorita
and Gonzalez-Rouco, 2000; Monahan er al., 2000). It should be
noted that these studies have used a variety of methods for
analysing trends in these modes of variability, including indices
based on pressure differentials and principal components (PCs)
of hemispheric sea level pressure (SLP). In addition, these
indices are sensitive to changes in the SLP patterns with time or
forcing and so trends must be treated with some caution. Wallace
(2000) finds that in both observations and modelling studies of
increased greenhouse gases, the trends are larger in the PC of
SLP than in the pressure differential indices. Meehl et al. (2000c)
show that the changed base climate state in a future warmer
climate could affect the period of global ENSO-like decadal (10
to 20-year period) variability such that there could be a shift to

longer periods.

the variability into two distinct regimes, and (2) in the stabilisa-

Although the global models have improved over time
(Chapter 8), they still have limitations that affect the simulation of
extreme events in terms of spatial resolution, simulation errors, and
parametrizations that must represent processes that cannot yet be
included explicitly in the models, particularly dealing with clouds
and precipitation (Meehl er al., 2000d). Yet we have confidence in
many of the qualitative aspects of the model simulations since they
are able to reproduce reasonably well many of the features of the
observed climate system not only in terms of means but also of
variability associated with extremes (Chapter 8). Simulations of
20th century climate have shown that including known climate
forcings (e.g., greenhouse gases, aerosols, solar) leads to improved
simulations of the climate conditions we have already observed.
Ensembles of climate change experiments are now being
performed to enable us to better quantify changes of extremes.

"Models described in the IPCC First Assessment Report
(Mitchell et al., 1990) showed that a warmer mean temperature
increases the probability of extreme warm days and decreases
the probability of extreme cold days. This result has appeared
consistently in a number of more recent different climate model
configurations (Dai ef al., 2001; Yonetani and Gordon, 2001).
There is also a decrease in diurnal temperature range (DTR)
since the night-time temperature minima warm faster than the
daytime maxima in many locations (e.g., Dai et al., 2001).
Although there is some regional variation as noted in Chapter
10, some of these changes in DTR have also been seen over a
number of areas of the world in observations (see Chapter 2). In
general, the pattern of change in return values for 20-year
extreme temperature events from an equilibrium simulation for
doubled CO, with a global atmospheric model coupled to a non-
dynamic slab ocean shows moderate increases over oceans and
larger increases over land masses (Zwiers and Kharin, 1998;
Figure 9.29). This result from a slab ocean configuration without
ocean currents is illustrative and could vary from model to
model, though it is similar to results from the fully coupled
version in a subsequent study (Kharin and Zwiers, 2000).

In global simulations for future climate, the percentage
increase in extreme (high) rainfall is greater than the percentage
increase in mean rainfall (Kharin and Zwiers, 2000). The return
period of extreme precipitation events is shortened almost
everywhere (Zwiers and Kharin, 1998). For example, they show
that over North America the 20-year return periods are reduced
by a factor of 2 indicating that extreme precipitation of that order
occurs twice as often.

Increased intensity of precipitation events in a future climate
with increased greenhouse gases was one of the earliest model
results regarding precipitation extremes, and remains a consis-
tent result in a number of regions with improved, more detailed
models (Hennessy et al., 1997; Kothavala, 1997; Durman et al.,
2001; Yonetani and Gordon, 2001). There have been questions
regarding the relatively coarse spatial scale resolution in
climate models being able to represent essentially mesoscale
and smaller precipitation processes. However, the increase in
the ability of the atmosphere to hold more moisture, as well as
associated increased radiative cooling of the upper troposphere
that contributes to destabilisation of the atmosphere in some
models, is physically consistent with increases in precipitation
and, potentially, with increases in precipitation rate.

As with other changes, it is recognised that changes in
precipitation intensity have a geographical dependence. For
example, Bhaskharan and Mitchell (1998) note that the range of
precipitation intensity over the south Asian monsoon region
broadens in a future climate experiment with increased
greenhouse gases, with decreases prevalent in the west and
increases more widespread in the east (see further discussion in
Chapter 10). Another model experiment (Brinkop, 2001) shows
that extreme values of the convective rain rate and the maximum
convective height occur more frequently during the 2071 to 2080
period than during the 1981 to 1990 period. The frequency of
highest-reaching convective events increases, and the same holds
for events with low cloud-top heights. In contrast, the frequency
of events with moderate-top heights decreases. On days when it
rains, the frequency of the daily rates of convective rainfall larger
than 40 mm/day in JJA and greater than 50 mm/day for DJF,
increases. Generally, one finds a strong increase in the rain rate
per convective event over most of the land areas on the summer
hemispheres and in the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ).
Between 10 and 30°S there are decreases in rain rate per event
over the ocean and parts of the continents.

"The greatest increase in the 20-year return values of daily
maximum temperature (Figure 9.29, top) is found in central and
southeast North America, central and south-east Asia and tropical
Africa, where there is a decrease in soil moisture content. Large
extreme temperature increases are also seen over the dry surface
of North Africa. In contrast, the west coast of North America is
affected by increased precipitation resulting in moister soil and
more moderate increases in extreme temperature. There are small
areas of decrease in the Labrador Sea and Southern Ocean that
are associated with changes in ocean temperature. The changes in
the return values of daily minimum temperature (Figure 9.29,
bottom) are larger than those of daily maximum temperature over
land areas and high latitude oceans where snow and ice retreat.
Somewhat larger changes are found over land masses and the
Arctic while smaller increases in extreme minimum temperatures
occur at the margins of the polar oceans. Thus, there is some
asymmetry between the change in the extremes of minimum and
maximum temperature (with a bigger increase for minima than
maxima). This has to do with the change in the nature of the
contact between atmosphere and the surface (e.g., minima
increase sharply where ice and snow cover have retreated
exposing either ocean or land, maxima increase more where the
land surface has dried). Consequently there is a seasonal depend-
ence related to changes in underlying surface conditions, which
indroduces uncertainties in some regions in some models
(Chapter 10).

"Simulations suggest that both the mean and standard
deviation of temperature are likely to change with a changed
climate, and the relative contribution of the mean and standard
deviation changes depends on how much each moment
changes. Increased temperature variance adds to the probability
of extreme high temperature events over and above what could
be expected simply from increases in the mean alone. The
increased variance of daily temperature in summer in northern
mid-continental areas noted above has also been seen in other
global models (Gregory and Mitchell, 1995). However, as
noted in Chapter 10, such changes can vary from region to
region and model to model (e.g., Buishand and Beersma
(1996), who showed some small decreases over an area of
Europe). The change in the mean is usually larger than the
change in variance for most climate change simulations.
Climate models have also projected decreased variability of
daily temperature in winter over mid-continental Europe
(Gregory and Mitchell, 1995). Such a decrease is partly related
to a reduction of cold extremes, which are primarily associated
with the increased mean of the daily minimum temperature.
The detrimental effect of extreme summer heat is likely to be
further exacerbated by increased atmospheric moisture. One
model scenario shows an increase of about 5°C in July mean
“heat index” (a measure which includes both the effects of
temperature and moisture, leading to changes in the heat index
which are larger than changes in temperature alone; it measures
effects on human comfort; see further discussion in Chapter 10)

2000). Changes in the heating and cooling degree days are

They related this increase to a change in the NAO (see

winter suppression of the North Pacific storm track in present day
climate which they attribute to very strong upper level winds at

address this problem more quantitatively, a global climate model
with increased CO, was analysed to show large increases in
frequency of low summer precipitation, the probability of dry
soil, and the occurrence of long dry spells (Gregory et al., 1997).
The latter was ascribed to the reduction of rainfall events in the
model rather than to decreases in mean precipitation. However,
the magnitude of this summer drying response may be related to
the model’s simulation of net solar radiation at the surface, and
more accurate simulation of surface fluxes over land will increase
confidence in the GCM climate changes.

with wind, ocean waves, etc. Due to model limitations in
previous generations of global climate models, until recently
there have been few studies examining changes in extra-tropical
cyclones in a future climate. With the improved recent genera-
tion of global climate models (see Chapter 8), such studies are
now becoming more credible. An analysis of an ensemble of
four future climate change experiments using a global coupled
model with increased CO, and sulphate aerosols showed an
increase in the number of deep low pressure systems in
Northern Hemisphere winter, while the number of weaker
storms was reduced (Carnell and Senior, 1998). Studies using
different models show a similar change for both hemispheres
(Sinclair and Watterson, 1999) or for a study region limited to
the North Atlantic (Knippertz et al., 2000).

"The reasons given for this common result are still under
discussion. Carnell and Senior (1998) ascribe it to a decrease in
the mean meridional temperature gradient in the future climate,
with high latitudes warming more than low latitudes (producing
fewer storms), and greater latent heating in the moister
atmosphere (resulting in deeper lows). Sinclair and Watterson
(1999) point to the reduced mean sea level pressure and
emphasise that vorticity as a measure of cyclone strength does
not increase. Knippertz et al.(2000) consider the increasing upper
tropospheric baroclinicity to be an important indicator of the
change in surface cyclone activity. They also detect an increasing
number of strong wind events in their simulation that can be
assigned to the increasing number of deep lows. Upper air storm
track activity (defined as the standard deviation of the band pass
filtered 500 hPa height and related to the surface lows) has been
found to increase over the East Atlantic and Western Europe with
rising greenhouse gas forcing (such as seen in Figure 9.30 from

"Alhough of great importance to society for their potential for
causing destruction, as well as their human and economic
impacts, there is little guidance from AOGCMs concerning the
future behaviour of tornadoes, hail or lightning. This is because
these phenomena are not explicitly resolved in AOGCMs, and
any studies that have been done have had to rely on empirical
relationships between model features and the phenomenon of
interest. For example, Price and Rind (1994a) derive a relation-
ship between lightning activity and convective cloud-top height
to infer an increase of lightning with increasing CO). They take
that relationship one step further to suggest a future increase in
lightning-caused fires due to the increased lightning activity and
decreased effective precipitation (Price and Rind, 1994b). Using
another empirical relationship between daily minimum tempera-
ture and severe convective storm frequency for France, Dessens
(1995) connects an increase in daily minimum temperature with
greater convective storm frequency and more hail damage in a
future climate with increased CO. However, there have been no
recent studies examining this problem with the current generation
of global climate models. Due to the fact that these severe
weather phenomena are sub-grid scale (even more so than
discussed below for tropical cyclones), and that second and third
order linkages between model output and empirical relationships
for limited regions must be used to derive results, we cannot
reach any definitive conclusions concerning possible future
increases in hail and lightning, and there is no information from
AOGCMs concerning future changes in tornado activity.

"Indices of tropical cyclone activity (Gray, 1979) summarise
the necessary large-scale conditions for tropical cyclone activity
from coarse resolution GCMs (Evans and Kempisty, 1998; Royer

and oceanic conditions (vertical shear, vorticity and thermo-
dynamic stability), and suggested that only small changes in the
tropical cyclone frequencies would occur (up to a 10% increase
in the Northern Hemisphere primarily in the north-west Pacific,
and up to a 5% decrease in the Southern Hemisphere). Climate
change studies to date show a great sensitivity to the measure o:
convective activity chosen, and depend less on the mode!

substantial (1 to 2°C) SST increases in the tropics from globa
warming, one would also get a correspondingly much bigger
warming in the upper troposphere leading to very little change in
the moist static stability (Holland, 1997). Another study shows
areas of deep convection that can be associated with tropica
cyclone formation would not expand with increases in CO, due
to an increase of the SST threshold for occurrence of deep
convection (Dutton et al., 2000). Additionally, since tropica
storm activity in most basins is modulated by El Nifio/La Nifia
conditions in the tropical Pacific, projections of future regional
changes in tropical storm frequencies may depend on accurate
projections of future El Nifio conditions, an area of considerable
uncertainty for climate models (as noted in Section 9.3.5.2).

"decreased baroclinicity in some regions due to greater surface
warming at high latitudes, and increasing mid-tropospheric
baroclinicity due to greater mid-tropospheric low latitude
warming (Kushner et al., 2001). Additionally, a number of
changes in weather and climate extremes from climate models
have been seen in observations in various parts of the world
(decreased diurnal temperature range, warmer mean tempera-
tures associated with increased extreme warm days and
decreased extreme cold days, increased rainfall intensity, etc.).
Though the climate models can simulate many aspects of climate
variability and extremes, they are still characterised by systematic
simulation errors and limitations in accurately simulating
regional climate such that appropriate caveats must accompany
any discussion of future changes in weather and climate
extremes.

the 20-year return values of daily maximum temperature is
found in central and Southeast North America, central and
Southeast Asia and tropical Africa where there is a decrease
in soil moisture content, and also over the dry surface of
North Africa. The west coast of North America is affected by
increased precipitation, resulting in moister soil and more

al., 1990). This value, which did not account for stratospheric
adjustment and solar absorption by CO:, is now considered to be
too high (Myhre et al., 1998). These authors suggest a best
estimate of 3.71 Wm""; model-specific values are used here (see
Table 9.A1). The effect on global mean temperature and sea level
change of using lower values of F>, has been investigated by
Wigley and Smith (1998). The lower F>, values result in slightly
lower temperature projections. Different definitions and methods
of calculation of model climate sensitivity are discussed in Section
9.3.4.1. Here the effective climate sensitivities based on the last
twenty years of the CMIP2 data are used.

Having selected the value of F>, and T>, appropriate to a
specific AOGCM, the simple model tuning process consists of
matching the AOGCM net heat flux across the ocean surface by
adjusting the simple model ocean parameters following Raper et
al. (2001a), using the CMIP2 results analysed in Raper ef al.
(2001b). Sokolov and Stone (1998) show that when using a pure
diffusion model to match the behaviour of different AOGCMs a
wide range of diffusion coefficients is needed. The range here is
much smaller because a 1-D upwelling diffusion model is used
and changes in the strength of the thermohaline circulation are
also accounted for. A decrease in the strength of the thermohaline
circulation leads to an increased heat flux into the ocean. In the
UD/EB model a weakening of the thermohaline circulation is
represented by a decline in the upwelling rate (see SAR). The rate
of sea level rise from thermal expansion for a collapse in the

"The simple climate model MAGICC (Wigley and Raper; 1987,
1992; updated in Raper et al., 1996) was used in the SAR to make
temperature projections for various forcing scenarios and for
sensitivity analyses. The justification for using the simple model
for this purpose was the model’s ability to simulate AOGCM
results in controlled comparisons spanning a wide range of
forcing cases (for example SAR Figure 6.13). The approach used
in this report differs from that in the SAR. Thus the upwelling
diffusion-energy balance model (UD/EB) model is not used here
as a stand-alone model in its own right but instead it is tuned to
individual AOGCMs and is used only as a tool to emulate and
extend their results. In this way, a range of results is produced
reflecting the range of AOGCM results. The tuning is based on the
CMIP2 data analysis of Raper et al. (2001b). The validity of the
tuning is tested by comparisons with AOGCM results in the DDC
data set and, where available, with recent AOGCM results using
the SRES scenarios. By using such simple models, differences
between different scenarios can easily be seen without the
obscuring effects of natural variability, or the similar variability
that occurs in coupled AOGCMs (Harvey et al., 1997). Simple
models also allow the effect of uncertainties in the climate
sensitivity and the ocean heat uptake to be quantified. Potentially,
other simple models (for example, Watterson (2000), Visser et al.
(2000)) could be used i ina similar “way.

"thermohaline circulation in the UD/EB model is tuned to match
that which occurs for an induced collapse in the GFDL model
(GFDL_R15_a) control run. An instantaneous 30% decline in the
UD/EB model upwelling rate gives rates of sea level rise
comparable to that seen in the GFDL model over a period of 500
years. Thus a 30% decline in the UD/EB model upwelling rate
represents a collapse in the thermohaline circulation. For the
individual models the rate of decline in the strength of the thermo-
haline circulation relative to the global mean temperature change
is based on the CIMP2 data and is specified by the parameter AT*.
It should be pointed out that the processes in the UD/EB model
that determine the heat flux into the ocean are not necessarily
physically realistic. Raper and Cubasch (1996) as well as Raper et
al. (2001a) show that the net heat flux into the ocean in the UD/EB
model can be tuned to match that in an AOGCM in several ways,
using different sets of parameter values. Nevertheless, if the
UD/EB model is carefully tuned to match the results of an
AOGCM, and provided the extrapolations are not too far removed
from the results used for tuning, the UD/EB model can be used to
give reasonably reliable estimates of AOGCM temperature
changes for different forcing scenarios. The thermal expansion
results are less reliably reproduced because thermal expansion is
related to the integrated heat flux into the ocean. Errors therefore
tend to accumulate. In addition, the expansion depends on the
distribution of warming in the ocean. Nonetheless, the simulation
is adequate for comparison of scenarios.

"This chapter is a new addition compared with previous IPCC
assessment reports. It stems from the increasing need to better
understand the processes that determine regional climate and to
evaluate regional climate change information for use in impact
studies and policy planning. To date, a relatively high level of
uncertainty has characterised regional climate change informa-
tion. This is due to the complexity of the processes that determine
regional climate change, which span a wide range of spatial and
temporal scales, and to the difficulty in extracting fine-scale
regional information from coarse resolution coupled
Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs).

"Evaluation of present day climate simulations is important
because, even though a good simulation of present day climate
does not necessarily imply a more accurate simulation of future
climate change (see also Chapter 13), confidence in the realism
of a model’s response to an anomalous climate forcing can be
expected to be higher when the model is capable of reproducing
observed climate. In addition, interpretation of the response is
often facilitated by understanding the behaviour of the model in
simulating the current climate. When possible, the capability of
models to simulate climates different from the present, such as
palaeoclimates, may also provide additional confidence in the
predicted climatic changes.

"Since the IPCC WGI Second Assessment Report (IPCC,
1996) (hereafter SAR), a substantial development has been
achieved in all these areas of research. This chapter has two
fundamental objectives. The first is to assess whether the
scientific community has been able to increase the confidence
that can be placed in the projection of regional climate change
caused by anthropogenic forcings since the SAR. The second is
to evaluate progress in regional climate research. It is not the
purpose of this chapter to provide actual regional climate change
information for use in impact work, although the material
discussed in this chapter serves most often for the formation of
climate change scenarios (see Chapter 13).

"Coupled AOGCMs are the modelling tools traditionally used
for generating projections of climatic changes due to anthro-
pogenic forcings. The horizontal atmospheric resolution of
present day AOGCMs is still relatively coarse, of the order of 300
to 500 km, due to the centennial to millennial time-scales associ-
ated with the ocean circulation and the computing requirements
that these imply. However, regional climate is often affected by
forcings and circulations that occur at the sub-AOGCM
horizontal grid scale (e.g., Giorgi and Mearns, 1991).
Consequently, AOGCMs cannot explicitly capture the fine-scale
structure that characterises climatic variables in many regions of
the world and that is needed for impact assessment studies (see
Chapter 13).

"The analysis of regional climate information in the SAR (Section
6.6 of Kattenberg et al., 1996) consisted of two primary
segments. In the first, results were analysed from an intercom-
parison of AOGCM experiments over seven large (sub-
continental) regions of the world. The intercomparison included
AOGCMs with and without ocean flux correction and focused on
summer and winter precipitation and surface air temperature.
Biases in the simulation of present day climate with respect to
observations and sensitivities at time of greenhouse gas (GHG)
doubling were analysed. A broad inter-model range of regionally
averaged biases and sensitivities was found, with marked inter-
regional variability. Temperature biases were mostly in the range
of +5°C, with several instances of larger biases (even in excess of
10°C). Precipitation biases were mostly in the range of +50%, but
with a few instances of biases exceeding 100%. The range of
sensitivities was lower for both variables.

The chapter is organised as follows. In the remainder of this
section a summary is first presented of the conclusions reached in
the SAR concerning regional climate change. This is followed by
a brief discussion of the regional climate problem. Section 10.2
examines the principles behind different approaches to the
generation of regional climate information. Regional attributes of
coupled AOGCM simulations are discussed in Section 10.3. This
discussion is important for different reasons: first, because
AOGCMs are the starting point in the generation of regional
climate change scenarios; second, because many climate impact
assessment studies still make use of output from coupled
AOGCM experiments without utilising any regionalisation tool;
and third because AOGCMs provide the baseline against which
to assess the added value of regionalisation techniques. Sections
10.4, 10.5 and 10.6 are devoted to the analysis of experiments
using high resolution and variable resolution AGCMs, RCMs and
empirical/statistical and_statistical/dynamical methods, respec-
tively. Section 10.7 analyses studies in which different regional-
isation techniques have been intercompared and Section 10.8
presents a summary assessment.

Therefore, a cross-disciplinary and multi-scale approach is
necessary for a full understanding of regional climate change
processes. This is based on the use of AOGCMs to simulate the
global climate system response to planetary scale forcings and
the variability patterns associated with broad regional forcing
anomalies (see Chapter 9). The information provided by the
AOGCMs can then be enhanced to account for regional and local
processes via a suitable use of the regionalisation techniques
discussed in this chapter.

The difficulty of simulating regional climate change is
therefore evident. The effects of forcings and circulations at the
planetary, regional and local scale need to be properly
represented, along with the teleconnection effects of regional
forcing anomalies. These processes are characterised by a range
of temporal variability scales, and can be highly non-linear. In
addition, similarly to what happens for the global Earth system,
regional climate is also modulated by interactions among
different components of the climate system, such as the
atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, biosphere and chemo-
sphere, which may require coupling of these components at the
regional scale.

The basic principles behind the regionalisation methods
identified here are discussed in Section 10.2.2, high resolution
and variable resolution AGCM experiments; Section 10.2.3,
RCMs; and Section 10.2.4, empirical/statistical and
statistical/dynamical models. The general philosophy behind
regionalisation techniques is to use input data from AOGCMs to
produce more detailed regional information. By design, many of
these techniques are not intended to strongly modify the
planetary scale circulations produced by the forcing AOGCM.
This ensures consistency with the AOGCM simulation and facili-
tates the interpretation of the additional detail as due to the

"For some applications, the regional information provided by
AOGCMs might suffice (Section 10.2.1), while in other cases
regionalisation techniques are needed in order to enhance the
regional information provided by coupled AOGCMs. The “added
value” expected of a regionalisation technique essentially
depends on the specific problem of interest. Examples in which
regionalisation tools can enhance the AOGCM information
include the simulation of the spatial structure of temperature and
precipitation in areas of complex topography and land-use distri-
bution, the description of regional and local atmospheric circula-
tions (e.g., narrow jet cores, mesoscale convective systems, sea-
breeze type circulations, tropical storms) and the representation
of processes at high frequency temporal scales (e.g., precipitation
frequency and intensity distributions, surface wind variability,
monsoon front onset and transition times).

"Given these definitions, the climate of a given region is
determined by the interaction of forcings and circulations that
occur at the planetary, regional and local spatial scales, and at a
wide range of temporal scales, from sub-daily to multi-decadal.
Planetary scale forcings regulate the general circulation of the
global atmosphere. This in turn determines the sequence and
characteristics of weather events and weather regimes that
characterise the climate of a region. Embedded within the
planetary scale circulation regimes, regional and local forcings
and mesoscale circulations modulate the spatial and temporal
structure of the regional climate signal, with an effect that can in
turn influence planetary scale circulation features. Examples of
regional and local scale forcings are those due to complex
topography, land-use characteristics, inland bodies of water, land-
ocean contrasts, atmospheric aerosols, radiatively active gases,

"A definition of regional scale is difficult, as different definitions
are often implied in different contexts. For example, definitions
can be based on geographical, political or physiographic consid-
erations, considerations of climate homogeneity, or considera-
tions of model resolution. Because of this difficulty, an
operational definition is adopted in this chapter based on the
range of “regional scale” found in the available literature. From
this perspective, regional scale is here defined as describing the
range of 104 to 107 km?. The upper end of the range (107 km”) is
also often referred to as sub-continental scale, and marked
climatic inhomogeneity can occur within sub-continental scale
regions in many areas of the globe. Circulations occurring at
scales greater than 107 km? (here referred to as “planetary
scales”) are clearly dominated by general circulation processes
and interactions. The lower end of the range (10* km?) is
representative of the smallest scales resolved by current regional
climate models. Scales smaller than 104 km? are referred to as
“local scale”.

From the theoretical viewpoint, the main advantage of
obtaining regional climate information directly from AOGCMs is
the knowledge that internal physical consistency is maintained.
The feedback resulting from climate change in a particular region
on planetary scale climate and the climate of other regions is
allowed for through physical and dynamical processes in the
model. This may be an important consideration when the simula-
tion of regional climate or climate change is compared across
regions.

"Though simulations of many centuries are required to fully
integrate the global climate system, for many applications
regional information on climate or climate change is required for
at most several decades. Over these time-scales AGCM, simula-
tions are feasible at resolutions of the order of 100 km globally,
or 50 km locally, with variable resolution models. This suggests
identifying periods of interest within AOGCM transient simula-
tions and modelling these with a higher resolution or variable
resolution AGCM to provide additional spatial detail (e.g.,
Bengtsson et. al., 1995; Cubasch ef al., 1995; Déqué and

"The majority of climate change impact studies have made use of
climate change information provided by transient runs with
coupled AOGCMs without any further regionalisation
processing. The primary reason for this is the ready availability
of this information, which is global in nature and is routinely
stored by major laboratories. Data can easily be drawn from the
full range of currently available AOGCM experiments of the
various modelling centres for any region of the world and
uncertainty due to inter-model (or inter-run) differences can thus
be evaluated (e.g., Hulme and Brown, 1998). In addition, data can
be obtained for a large range of variables down to short (sub-
daily) time-scales.

Here the AGCM is used to provide a reinterpretation of the
atmospheric response to the anomalous atmospheric forcing (from
GHG and aerosols) experienced in a transient AOGCM simulation.
Hence, both this forcing and its accumulated effect on the ocean
surface have to be provided to the AGCM. In a typical experiment
(e.g., May and Roeckner, 2001), two time slices, say 1961 to 1990
and 2071 to 2100, are selected from a transient AOGCM simula-
tion. The simulations include prescribed time-dependent GHG and
aerosol concentrations as in the corresponding periods of the
AOGCM tun. Also prescribed as lower boundary conditions are
the time-dependent Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and sea-ice
distributions simulated by the AOGCM. The AGCM simulations
are initialised using atmospheric and land-surface conditions
interpolated from the corresponding AOGCM fields.

Advantages and disadvantages of using AOGCM informa-
tion in impact studies can weigh-up differently depending on the
region and variables of interest. For example, in instances for
which sub-grid scale variation is weak (e.g., for mean sea level
pressure) the practical advantages of using direct AOGCM data
may predominate (see also Chapter 13). However, even if resolu-
tion factors limit the feasibility of using regional information
from coupled AOGCMs for impact work, AOGCMs are the
starting point of any regionalisation technique presently used.
Therefore, it is of utmost importance that AOGCMs show good
performance in simulating circulation and climatic features
affecting regional climates, such as jet streams and storm tracks.
Indeed, most indications are that, in this regard, the AOGCM
performance is generally improving, because of both increased
resolution and improvements in the representation of physical
processes (see Chapter 8).
"	Text
"The limitations of AOGCM regional information are,
however, well known. By definition, coupled AOGCMs cannot
provide direct information at scales smaller than their resolution
(order of several hundred kilometres), neither can AOGCMs
capture the detailed effects of forcings acting at sub-grid scales
(unless parametrized). Biases in the climate simulation at the
AOGCM resolution can thus be introduced by the absence of sub-
grid scale variations in forcing. As an example, a narrow (sub-grid
scale) mountain range can be responsible for rain shadow effects
at the broader scale. Many important aspects of the climate of a
region (e.g., climatic means in areas of complex topography or
extreme weather systems such as tropical cyclones) can only be
directly simulated at much finer resolution than that of current
AOGCMs. Analysis relevant to these aspects is undertaken with
AOGCM output, but various qualifications need to be considered
in the interpretation of the results. Past analyses have indicated
that even at their smallest resolvable scales, which still fall under
our definition of regional, AOGCMs have substantial problems in
reproducing present day climate characteristics. The minimum
skilful scale of a model is of several grid lengths, since these are
necessary to describe the smallest wavelengths in the model and

Use of high resolution and variable resolution global
models is computationally very demanding, which poses limits
to the increase in resolution obtainable with this method.
However, it has been suggested that high-resolution AGCMs

RCMs or statistical downscaling, thus effectively providing an
intermediate step between AOGCMs and regional and empirical
models.

"forcing for the anomaly simulation. If the AOGCM calculates the
aerosol concentrations from prescribed sources then the AGCM
may use the same method. This has the advantage of providing
aerosol concentrations consistent with the AGCM circulations,
although its global and regional effects may be different from
those in the AOGCM.

To date, this technique has been used only in one-way mode,
ie., with no feedback from the RCM simulation to the driving
GCM. The basic strategy is, thus, to use the global model to
simulate the response of the global circulation to large-scale
forcings and the RCM to (a) account for sub-GCM grid scale
forcings (e.g., complex topographical features and land cover
inhomogeneity) in a physically-based way; and (b) enhance the
simulation of atmospheric circulations and climatic variables at
fine spatial scales.

"The nested regional climate modelling technique consists of
using initial conditions, time-dependent lateral meteorological
conditions and surface boundary conditions to drive high-resolu-
tion RCMs. The driving data is derived from GCMs (or analyses
of observations) and can include GHG and aerosol forcing. A
variation of this technique is to also force the large-scale
component of the RCM solution throughout the entire domain
(e.g., Kida et al., 1991; Cocke and LaRow, 2000; von Storch et
al., 2000)

Another issue concerning the use of variable resolution
models is that feedback effects from fine scales to larger scales
are represented only as generated by the region of interest.
Conversely, in the real atmosphere, feedbacks derive from
different regions and interact with each other so that a variable
resolution model, based on a single high resolution region, might
give an improper description of fine-to-coarse scale feedbacks.
In addition, a sufficient minimal resolution must be retained
outside the high resolution area of interest in order to prevent a
degradation of the simulation of the whole global system.

The philosophy behind the use of high or variable resolution
AGCM simulations is that, given the SST, sea ice, trace gas and
aerosol forcing, relatively high-resolution information can be
obtained globally or regionally without having to perform the
whole transient simulation with high resolution models. The
main theoretical advantage of this approach is that the resulting
simulations are globally consistent, capturing remote responses
to the impact of higher resolution. The use of higher resolution
can lead to improved simulation of the general circulation in
addition to providing regional detail (e.g., HIRETYCS, 1998;
Stratton, 1999a).

A current weakness of high resolution AGCMs is that the
generally use the same formulations as at the coarse resolution
for which these have been optimised to reproduce current
climate. Some processes may be represented less accurately
when finer scales are resolved and so the model formulations
would need to be optimised for use at higher resolution.
Experience with high resolution GCMs is still limited, so that, at
present, increasing the resolution of an AGCM generally both
enhances and degrades different aspects of the simulations. With
global variable resolution models, this issue is further compli-
cated as the model physics parametrizations have to be designed
in such a way that they can be valid, and function correctly, over
the range of resolutions covered by the model.

In general, AGCMs will evolve their own planetary scale
climatology. Therefore, in a climate change simulation they are
providing a reinterpretation of the impact on the atmosphere of
the sea surface and radiative forcings compared to that given by
the driving AOGCM. This may lead to inconsistency with the
AOGCM.-derived forcing. This issue has yet to be explored but
should be considered carefully when interpreting AGCM
responses. It would be of less concern if a model simulation of
the resolved planetary scale variables were asymptoting to a
solution as resolution increased, i.e., if the solution would not
change fundamentally in character with resolution but just add
extra detail at the finer scales. Evidence shows that this is not the
case at the current resolution of AOGCMs (Williamson, 1999).

The nested regional modelling technique essentially
originated from numerical weather prediction, and the use of
RCMs for climate application was pioneered by Dickinson et al.
(1989) and Giorgi (1990). RCMs are now used in a wide range of
climate applications, from palaeoclimate (Hostetler et al., 1994,
2000) to anthropogenic climate change studies (Section 10.5).
They can provide high resolution (up to 10 to 20 km or less) and
multi-decadal simulations and are capable of describing climate
feedback mechanisms acting at the regional scale. A number of
widely used limited area modelling systems have been adapted
to, or developed for, climate application. More recently, RCMs
have begun to couple atmospheric models with other climate
process models, such as hydrology, ocean, sea-ice,
chemistry/aerosol and Jand- -biosphere models.
"	Text
"Two main theoretical limitations of this technique are the
effects of systematic errors in the driving fields provided by
global models; and lack of two-way interactions between
regional and global climate (with the caveats discussed in Section
10.2.2 for variable resolution models). Practically, for a given
application, consideration needs to be given to the choice of
physics parametrizations, model domain size and resolution,
technique for assimilation of large-scale meteorological
conditions, and internal variability due to non-linear dynamics
not associated with the boundary forcing (e.g., Giorgi and
Mearns, 1991, 1999; Ji and Vernekar 1997). Depending on the
domain size and resolution, RCM simulations can be computa-
tionally demanding, which has limited the length of many experi-
ments to date. Finally, GCM fields are not routinely stored at high
temporal frequency (6-hourly or higher), as required for RCM
boundary conditions, and thus careful co-ordination between
global and regional modellers is needed in order to perform RCM
experiments.

"Statistical downscaling is based on the view that regional climate
may be thought of as being conditioned by two factors: the large-
scale climatic state, and regional/local physiographic features (e.g.,
topography, land-sea distribution and land use; von Storch, 1995,
1999a). From this viewpoint, regional or local climate information
is derived by first determining a statistical model which relates
large-scale climate variables (or “predictors’’) to regional and local
variables (or “‘predictands”). Then the predictors from an AOGCM
simulation are fed into this statistical model to estimate the

corresponding local and regional climate characteristics.

Criteria to evaluate the level of confidence in a regional
climate change simulation can be based on how well the models
reproduce present day climate or past climates and how well the
climate change simulations converge across models and methods
(see Chapters 8 and 9). These criteria will be drawn upon in
evaluating available simulations. We add that the emerging
activity of seasonal to interannual climate forecasting, particu-
larly at the regional scale, may give valuable insights into the
capability of models to simulate climatic changes and may
provide objective methodologies for evaluating the long-term
prediction performance of climate models at the regional scale.

One of the primary advantages of these techniques is that they
are computationally inexpensive, and thus can easily be applied to
output from different GCM experiments. Another advantage is that
they can be used to provide local information, which can be most
needed in many climate change impact applications. The applica-
tions of downscaling techniques vary widely with respect to
regions, spatial and temporal scales, type of predictors and predic-
tands, and climate statistics (see Section 10.6). In addition,
empirical downscaling methods often offer a framework for testing
the ability of physical models to simulate the empirically found
links between large-scale and small-scale climate (Busuioc ef al.,
1999; Murphy, 1999; Osborn er al., 1999; von Storch et al., 1993;
Noguer, 1994).

The major theoretical weakness of statistical downscaling
methods is that their basic assumption is not verifiable, i.e., that the
statistical relationships developed for present day climate also hold
under the different forcing conditions of possible future climates.
In addition, data with which to develop relationships may not be
readily available in remote regions or regions with complex
topography. Another caveat is that these empirically-based
techniques cannot account for possible systematic changes in
regional forcing conditions or feedback processes. The possibility
of tailoring the statistical model to the requested regional or local
information is a distinct advantage. However, it has the drawback
that a systematic assessment of the uncertainty of this type of
technique, as well as a comparison with other techniques, is
difficult and may need to be carried out on a case-by-case basis.
"	Text
"Sources of uncertainty in producing regional climate
information are of different nature. On the modelling and statis-
tical downscaling side, uncertainties are associated with
imperfect knowledge and/or representation of physical processes,
limitations due to the numerical approximation of the model’s
equations, simplifications and assumptions in the models and/or
approaches, internal model variability, and inter-model or inter-
method differences in the simulation of climate response to given
forcings. It is also important to recognise that the observed
regional climate is sometimes characterised by a high level of
uncertainty due to measurement errors and sparseness of stations,
especially in remote regions and in regions of complex
topography. Finally, the internal variability of the global and
regional climate system adds a further level of uncertainty in the
evaluation of a climate change simulation.

"There are several levels of uncertainty in the generation of
regional climate change information. The first level, which is not
dealt with in this chapter, is associated with alternative scenarios
of future emissions, their conversion to atmospheric concentra-
tions and the radiative effects of these (see Chapter 13). The
second level is related to the simulation of the transient climate
response by AOGCMs for a given emission scenario (see also
Chapters 8 and 9). This uncertainty has a global aspect, related to
the model global sensitivity to forcing, as well as a regional
aspect, more tied to the model simulation of general circulation
features. This uncertainty is important both, when AOGCM
information is used for impact work without the intermediate step
of a regionalisation tool, and when AOGCM fields are used to
drive a regionalisation technique. The final level of uncertainty
occurs when the AOGCM data are processed through a regional-

isation method.

A range of statistical downscaling models, from regressions to
neural networks and analogues, has been developed for regions
where sufficiently good data sets are available for model calibra-
tion. In a particular type of statistical downscaling method, called
statistical-dynamical downscaling (see Section 10.6.2.3), output of
atmospheric mesoscale models is used in statistical relationships.
Statistical downscaling techniques have their roots in synoptic
climatology (Growetterlagen; e.g., Baur et al., 1944; Lamb, 1972)
and numerical weather prediction (Klein and Glahn, 1974), but
they are also currently used for a wide range of climate applica-
tions, from historical reconstruction (e.g., Appenzeller et al., 1998;
Luterbacher et al., 1999), to regional climate change problems (see
Section 10.6). A number of review papers have dealt with
downscaling concepts, prospects and limitations: von Storch
(1995); Hewitson and Crane (1996); Wilby and Wigley (1997);
Zorita and von Storch (1997); Gyalistras er al. (1998); Murphy

Current generation AOGCM simulations in which historical
changes in climate forcing over the 20th century are used enable
simulated regional climatic trends to be assessed against
observations. This was done by Boer et al. (2000a) for tempera-
ture and precipitation for the regions of southern Europe, North
America, Southeast Asia, Sahel and Australia (defined as in the
SAR) using the CGCM1 model. Simulated and observed
regional linear temperature trends agreed for all regions, except
the Sahel, when sulphate forcing was included. Little could be
said about agreement in observed and model precipitation trends
as these trends were weak over the period in both the model and
the observations.

Comparison against observations of daily precipitation
variability as simulated at grid boxes in GCMs is problematic
because the corresponding variability in the real world operates
at much finer spatial scale (see Hennessy et al., 1997). A signif-
icant development in this area has been the work of Osborn and
Hulme (1997) who devised a method of calculating grid box
average observed daily precipitation that corrects for biases
commonly introduced by insufficient station density. Using this
correction, agreement between observations and the results of
the CSIRO GCM were significantly improved. In an analysis of
different AGCMs over Europe, Osborn and Hulme (1998) found
that the models commonly simulated precipitation in winter to
be more frequent and less intense than observed. Daily temper-
ature variability over Europe was found to be too high in winter
in the Hadley Centre model (Gregory and Mitchell, 1995) and in
winter and spring in the ECHAM3/LSG model (Buishand and
Beersma, 1996).

Analysis of global climate model performance in reproducing
observed regional climate variability has given widely varying
results depending on model and region. Interannual variability in
temperature was assessed regionally, as well as globally, in a
long control simulation with the HadCM2 model (Tett et al.,
1997). Many aspects of model variability compared well against
observations, although there was a tendency for temperature
variability to be too high over land. In the multi-regional study
of Giorgi and Francisco (2000a), both regional temperature and
precipitation interannual variability of HadCM2 were found to
be generally overestimated. Similar results were obtained in the
European study of Machenhauer ef al. (1998) using the
ECHAM/OPYC3 model. However, in a 200-year control
simulation with the CGCM1 model (see Table 9.1), Flato et al.
(2000) noted that simulated interannual variability in seasonal
temperature and precipitation compared well with observations
both globally and in five selected study regions (Sahel, North
America, Australia, southern Europe and Southeast Asia).

single simulations using the CSIRO Mk2, CCSR/NIES and
ECHAM/OPYC models, a three-member ensemble of CGCM1
simulations and a four-member ensemble of HadCM2 simula-
tions (see Table 9.1 for further model details). Figure 10.2 shows
the biases in regionally averaged seasonal mean surface temper-
ature and precipitation for 1961 to 1990 using as reference the
gridded analysis of New et al. (1999). Nearly all regional
temperature biases are within the range of +4°C. The main
exceptions to this are negative biases of more than 5°C in some
models over Asia in DJF. Precipitation biases are mostly
between —40 and +80%, with the exception of positive biases in
DJF in excess of 100% over central America (CAM), northern
Africa (WAF and SAH), Alaska (ALA), and some parts of Asia
(EAS, SAS, TIB and NAS). The regional biases of Figure 10.2
are, in general terms, smaller than those of a similar analysis
presented in the SAR (see also Kittel et al., 1998) which, for
example, showed regional temperature biases as high as 10 to
15°C in some models and regions. Given that the current
analysis also includes many more regions, this difference in
general performance strongly suggests that simulation of surface
climate at the sub-continental scale is improved in current
generation AOGCMs.

GS models agreeing. The global annual average warming of the models used span 3.0 to 4.9°C for GG and 2.5 to 3.8°C for GS, and therefore
a regional 40% amplification represents warming ranges of 4.2 to 6.9°C for GG and 3.5 to 5.3°C for GS.

—
Inter-model differences in regional warming partially reflect
differences in the global climate sensitivities of the models
concerned. This effect may be set aside by comparing the
regional warmings given in Giorgi and Francisco (2000b) with
the corresponding global average warmings of the simulations
used (Figure 10.4). Nearly all land areas warm more rapidly than
the global average, particularly those at high latitudes in the cold
season. For both the non-sulphate and sulphate cases, in the
northern high latitudes, central Asia and Tibet (ALA, GRL, NAS,
CAS and TIB) in DJF and in northern Canada, Greenland and
central Asia and Tibet (GRL, CAS and TIB) in JJA, the warming
is in excess of 40% above the global average. In both cases,
warming is less than the global average in South and Southeast
Asia, and southern South America (SAS, SEA and SSA) in JJA.
In this analysis, differences between the non-sulphate and
sulphate cases are minor. A strong contribution to the enhance-
ment of warming over cold climate regions is given by the snow
and sea ice albedo feedback mechanism (Giorgi and Francisco,
2000b). The snow albedo feedback also tends to enhance
warming over high elevation regions (Fyfe and Flato, 1999).

"In line with the globally averaged precipitation increase
given by all models (see Chapter 9), precipitation is also
simulated to increase regionally in the majority of cases.
However, regions of precipitation decrease are also simulated.
Precipitation reduction can be due to changes in large and
synoptic scale features (e.g., changes in storm track characteris-
tics) and/or to local feedback processes (e.g., between soil
moisture and precipitation). The results of the regional analysis of
Giorgi and Francisco (2000b) are presented in Figure 10.5 (as
percentage changes for each model, region and forcing scenario)
and are used in an analysis of inter-model consistency which is
presented in Figure 10.6. In both the non-sulphate and sulphate
cases for DJF, most simulations show increased precipitation for
regions in the mid- to high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere
(ALA, GRL, WNA, ENA, CNA, NEU, NAS, CAS and TIB) and
over Antarctica (ANT). In the tropics, models consistently show
increase in Africa (EAF and WAF), increase or little change in
South America (AMZ) and little change in Southeast Asia (SEA).
Simulated regional precipitation decreases are common in sub-
tropical latitudes, but only for central America (CAM) and
northern Australia (NAU) are decreases indicated by most
models in both cases. The pattern is broadly similar in JJA,

The SRES results may be compared with the earlier results summarised in Figures 10.4 and 10.6 (which will be referred to
here as the [S92a results). However, it should be noted that these two sets of results differ in the set of models used (both in the

GHG+sulphate and for SRES it is A2 versus B2). Also, due to differences in the number of models, thresholds for agreement are

The above comparisons concern the quantification of two different sources of uncertainty represented in the cascade of
uncertainty described in Chapter 13, Section 13.5.1 (Figure 13.2). These include uncertainties in future emissions (IS92a GG
and GS; SRES A2 and B2), and uncertainties in modelling the response of the climate system to a given forcing (samples of up
to nine AOGCMs). Agreement across the different scenarios and climate models suggests, relatively speaking, less uncertainty
about the nature of regional climate change than where there is disagreement. For example, the agreement for northern latitude
winter precipitation extends across all emission scenarios and all models, whereas there is considerable disagreement (greater
uncertainty) for tropical areas in JJA. Note that these measures of uncertainty are qualitative and applied on a relatively coarse
spatial scale. It should also be noted that the range of uncertainty covered by the four emissions scenarios does not encompass
the entire envelope of uncertainty of emissions (see Chapter 9, Section 9.2.2.4, and Chapter 13, Section 13.5.1). The range of
models (representing the uncertainties in modelling the response to a given forcing) is somewhat more complete than in earlier
analyses, but also limited.

¢ In broad terms, the temperature results from SRES are similar to the IS92a results. In each of the two SRES and IS92a cases,
warming is in excess of 40% above the global average in Alaska, northern Canada, Greenland, northern Asia, and Tibet (ALA,
GRL, NAS and TIB) in DJF and in central Asia and Tibet (CAS and TIB) in JJA. All four cases also show warming less than
the global average in South and Southeast Asia, and southern South America (SAS, SEA and SSA) in JJA.

¢ The main difference in the results is that there are substantially more instances for the SRES cases where there is disagree-
ment on the magnitude of the relative regional warming. This difference is mainly evident in tropical and Southern Hemisphere
regions.

* The precipitation results from SRES are also broadly similar to the corresponding IS92a results. There are many regions where

the direction of precipitation change (although not necessarily the magnitude of this change) is consistent across all four cases.

In DJF this is true for increase in northern mid- to high latitude regions, Antarctica and tropical Africa (ALA, GRL, WNA,

ENA, NEU, NAS, TIB, CAS, WAF, EAF and ANT) and decrease in Central America (CAM). In JJA it is true for increase in

high latitude regions (ALA, GRL, NAS and ANT) and for decrease in southern and northern Australia (SAU and NAU). Little

change in Southeast Asia in DJF and little change or increase over South Asia in JJA are also consistent results.

Although there are no cases where the SRES and IS92a results indicate precipitation changes of opposite direction, there are

some notable differences. In the Sahara and in East Asia (SAH and EAS) in JJA, the results for both SRES scenarios show

consistent increase whereas this was not true in either of the IS92a cases. On the other hand, in central North America and

northern Australia (CNA and NAU) in DJF, and in East Africa (EAF) in JJA, the results for both SRES scenarios show model

disagreement whereas the IS92a scenarios showed a consistent direction of change (increase in CNA, and decrease in EAF

and NAU). It is also notable that the consistent decrease in JJA precipitation over the Mediterranean basin (MED) seen for

both IS92a cases is present for SRES only for the A2 scenario (for which the decrease is large).

climate change simulation was due to inter-model differences,
with intra-ensemble and inter-scenario differences being less
important (see Figures 10.3 and 10.5). However, it should be
noted that Giorgi and Francisco (2000a,b) used long (thirty year)
means and large (sub-continental scale) regions and that the
uncertainty due to simulated natural variability would be larger
when shorter averaging periods, or smaller regions, are used. The
results of Hulme et al. (1999) also suggest that low-frequency
natural climatic variability is important at the sub-regional scale

Daily high temperature extremes are likely to increase in
frequency as a function of the increase in mean temperature, but
this increase is modified by changes in daily variability of
temperature. There is a corresponding decrease in the frequency
of daily low temperature extremes. Kharin and Zwiers (2000) and
Zwiers and Kharin (1997) found that in all regions of the globe
the CGCMI1 model simulated substantial increases in the
magnitude of extreme daily maximum and minimum tempera-
tures, with an average frequency of occurrence of once per
twenty years. Delworth et al. (1999) considered simulated
changes of a ‘heat index’ (a measure which combines the effect
temperature and moisture) in the GFDL R15a model. Their
results indicated that seasonally warm and humid areas such as
the south-eastern United States, India, Southeast Asia and
northern Australia can experience increases in the heat index
substantially greater than that expected due to warming alone.

"For the central plains of North America, IPCC (1990) noted
a good deal of similarity in the response of equilibrium 2*CO,
experiments, with precipitation decreases prevailing in the
summer and increases in the winter of less than 10%. In the
second group of experiments (nine transient runs with AOGCMs)
a wider range of responses was found (in the SAR). In winter,
changes in precipitation ranged from about —12 to +20% for the
time of CO, doubling, and most of the models (six out of nine)
exhibited increases. In summer, the range of change was narrower,
within +10%, but there was no clear majority response towards
increases or decreases. Doherty and Mearns (1999) found that the
CGCM1 and HadCM2 models simulated opposite changes in
precipitation in both seasons over North America. While overall
there is a tendency for more decreases to be simulated in the
summer and more increases in the winter, there does not seem to
be a reduction in the uncertainty for this region through the

Many studies have considered GCM-simulated patterns of
climate change in the European region (e.g., Barrow et al., 1996;
Hulme and Brown, 1998; Osborn and Hulme, 1998; Raisénen,
1998; Benestad er al. 1999; Osborn et al., 1999). Hulme et al.
(2000) provide an overview of simulated changes in the region by
considering the results of twenty-three climate change simula-
tions (forced by GHG change only) produced between the years
1983 and 1998 and including mixed-layer 1x and 2xXCO,
equilibrium experiments as well as transient experiments. Figure
10.7 shows their results for simulated change in annual precipita-
tion, averaged by latitude and normalised to percentage change
per degree of global warming. It may be seen that the consensus
amongst current models for drying in southern Europe and wetter
conditions in northern Europe represents a continuation of a
pattern established amongst the earlier simulations. The effect of
model development has primarily been to intensify this pattern of
response.

Fewer studies have considered changes in variability and
extremes of synoptic circulation under enhanced GHG conditions.
Huth (1997) noted little change in synoptic circulation variability
under equilibrium 2CO, conditions over North America and
Europe. Katzfey and McInnes (1996) found that the intense cut-
off lows off the Australian east coast became less common under
equilibrium 2>%CO, conditions in the CSIRO model, although
they had limited confidence in this result.

climate information from AGCMs with variable and increased
horizontal resolution. Although the basic methodology is
suggested in the work of Bengtsson et al. (1995), where a high
resolution GCM was used to simulate changes in tropical cyclones
in a warmer climate, it is only in the last few years that such
models have been used more widely to predict regional aspects of
climate change. Even so, only a limited number of experiments
have been conducted to date (see Table 10.1) and hence what
follows is not a definitive evaluation of the technique but an initial
exploration of its potential.

"biases in the simulation of present day climate are highly variable
from region to region and across models. Seasonal temperature
biases are typically within the range of +4°C but exceed +5°C in
some regions, particularly in DJF. Precipitation biases are mostly
between —40 and +80%, but exceed 100% in some regions. These
regional biases are, in general terms, smaller than those of a
similar analysis presented in the SAR. When it has been assessed,
many aspects of model variability have compared well against
observations, although significant model-dependent biases have
been noted. Model performance was poorer at the finer scales,
particularly in areas of strong topographical variation. This
highlights the need for finer resolution regionalisation techniques.

The tendency for increased rainfall variability in enhanced
GHG simulations is reflected in a tendency for increases in the
intensity and frequency of extreme heavy rainfall events. Such
increases have been documented in regionally focused studies for
Europe, North America, South Asia, the Sahel, southern Africa,
Australia and the South Pacific (Hennessy et al., 1997; Bhaskaran
and Mitchell, 1998; McGuffie et al 1999; Jones, R.N. et al., 2000)
as well as in the global studies of Kharin and Zwiers (2000) and
Zwiers and Kharin (1998). For example, Hennessy et al. (1997)
found that under 2*CO, conditions the one-year return period
events in Europe, Australia, India and the USA increased in
intensity by 10 to 25% in two models.

Changes in the occurrence of dry spells or droughts have
been assessed for some regions using recent model results. Joubert
et al. (1996) examined drought occurrence over southern Africa in
an equilibrium 2 CO, CSIRO simulation and noted areas of both
substantial increase and decrease. Gregory et al. (1997) looked at
drought occurrence over Europe and North America in a transient
simulation using both rainfall-based and soil moisture-based
measures of drought. In all cases, marked increases were obtained.
This was attributed primarily to a reduction in the number of
rainfall events rather than a reduction in mean rainfall. Marked
increases in the frequency and intensity of drought were found
also by Kothavala (1997) over Australia using the Palmer drought
severity index.

(2000a) found a tendency for regional interannual variability of
seasonal mean precipitation to increase in HadCM2 simulations in
many of the regions they considered. Increases in interannual
variability also predominated in the CGCM1 simulation (Boer ert

areas where mean rainfall decreased. Beersma and Buishand
(1999) mostly found increases in monthly precipitation variance
over southern Europe, northern Europe and central North
America. A number of studies have reported a tendency for
interannual rainfall variability to increase over South Asia (SAR;
Lal et al., 2000). McGuffie er al. (1999) identified a tendency for
increased daily rainfall variability in two models over the Sahel,
North America, South Asia, southern Europe and Australia. It
should also be noted that in many regions interannual climatic
variability is strongly related to ENSO, and thus will be affected
by changes in ENSO behaviour (see Chapter 9).

Simulated changes in mean climatic conditions for the last
decades of the 21st century (compared to present day climate)
vary substantially among models and among regions. All land
regions undergo warming in all seasons, with the warming being
generally more pronounced over cold climate regions and seasons.
Average precipitation increases over most regions, especially in
the cold season, due to an intensified hydrological cycle. However,
some exceptions occur in which most models concur in simulating
decreases in precipitation. The magnitude of regional precipitation
change varies considerably among models with the typical range
being around 0 to 50%, where the direction of change is strongly
indicated, and around —30 to +30% where it is not. There is strong
tendency for models to simulate regional increases in precipitation
variability with associated increases in the frequency of extreme
rainfall events. Increased interannual precipitation variability is
also commonly simulated and, in some regions, increases in
drought or dry-spell occurrence have been noted. Daily to inter-
annual variability of temperature is simulated to decrease in
winter and increase in summer in mid-latitude Northern
Hemisphere land areas.

The existence of these common responses to increased resolu-
tion suggests that they result from improved representation of the
resolved variables. In contrast, an increase in the intensity of sub-
tropical anticyclones observed in ECHAM4 results from a tropos-
pheric warming promoted by excessive cirrus clouds attributed to
a scale-dependent response in the relevant parametrization (Stendel

The mean circulation is generally well simulated by AGCMs,
though relatively large regional-scale biases can still be present.
Many features of the large-scale climate of AGCMs are retained at
higher resolution (Déqué and Piedelievre, 1995; Stendel and
Roeckner, 1998; May, 1999; Stratton, 1999a). A common change
is a poleward shift of the extra-tropical storm track regions. It has
been suggested that this is linked to a general deepening of
cyclones, noted as a common feature in high-resolution
atmospheric models (Machenhauer et al., 1996; Stratton 1999a).
Mote intense activity is also seen at higher resolution in the tropics.
For example, a stronger Hadley circulation was observed in
ECHAM4 and HadAM3a that worsened agreement with observa-
tions (Stendel and Roeckner, 1998; Stratton, 1999b).

The increased summer temperatures in n Europe i in HadAM3a
were caused by reduced cloud cover at higher resolution (Jones
1999) and warming and drying, in summer, was seen over all extra-
tropical continents (Stratton, 1999b). This clearly demonstrates a
potential drawback of increasing the resolution of a model without
comprehensively retuning the physics. Krinner et al. (1997)
showed that, to obtain a reasonable simulation of the surface
climatology of the Antarctic with the LMD variable resolution
AGCM, many modifications to the model physics were required.
The model was then able to simulate surface temperatures to within
2 to 4°C of observations and to provide a good simulation of the ice

high (by 2 to 5°C). Increasing the resolution to T106 did not
improve winter temperatures and, in summer, the spatial patterns

For precipitation, spatial patterns were improved in summer but
degraded in winter. The summer warming was due to excessive
insolation from reduced cloud cover and overly transparent clear
skies (Wild et al., 1995). Improved physics in ECHAM4 reduced
some of the radiation errors but the precipitation and temperature
biases remained (Wild et al, 1996; Stendel and Roeckner, 1998). In
simulations of European climate with ARPEGE (Déqué and
Piedelievre, 1995) and HadAM2b/3a (Jones, 1999; Stratton,
1999a), improved flow at higher resolution generally led to better
surface temperatures and precipitation. However, over south-
eastern Europe, precipitation biases increased in both models, as

did the warm temperature bias in HadAMBa.

Most assessments of changes in tropical cyclone behaviour in a future climate have been derived from GCM or RCM studies
of the climate response to anthropogenically-derived atmospheric forcings (e.g., Bengtsson et al., 1996, 1997; Walsh and Katzfey,
2000). Recently, more focused approaches have been used: nesting a hurricane prediction model in a GCM climate change simula-

that there is large decadal variability in the frequency and no significant trend during the last century. One study looking at the

The extreme precipitation associated with tropical cyclones can also be very damaging. The very high resolution studies
discussed above suggest that increases in the intensity of tropical cyclones will be accompanied by increases in mean and
maximum precipitation rates. In the cases studied, precipitation in the vicinity of the storm centre increased by 20% whereas peak
rates increased by 30%. Part of these increases may be due to the increased moisture-holding capacity of a warmer atmosphere
but nevertheless point to substantially increasing destructive capacity of tropical cyclones in a warmer climate.

Tropical cyclones can have devastating human and economic impacts (e.g., Pielke and Landsea, 1998) and therefore accurate
estimates of future changes in their frequency, intensity and location would be of great value. However, because of their relatively
small extent (in global modelling terms) and intense nature, detailed simulation of tropical cyclones for this purpose is difficult.
Atmospheric GCMs can simulate tropical cyclone-like disturbances which increase in realism at higher resolution though the
intense central core is not resolved (e.g., Bengtsson et al., 1995; McDonald, 1999). Further increases of resolution, by the use of
RCMs, provide greater realism (e.g., Walsh and Watterson, 1997) with a very high resolution regional hurricane prediction model
giving a reasonable simulation of the magnitude and location of maximum surface wind intensities for the north-west Pacific basin
(Knutson et al., 1998). GCMs generally provide realistic simulation of the location and frequency of tropical cyclones (e.g., Tsutsui
and Kasahara, 1996; Yoshimura et al., 1999). See also Chapter 8 for more details on tropical cyclones in GCMs.

An indication of the likely changes in maximum intensity of cyclones will be better provided by models able to simulate
realistic tropical cyclone intensities. A sample of GCM-generated tropical cyclone cases nested in a hurricane prediction model
gave increases in maximum intensity (of wind speed) of 5 to 11% in strong cyclones over the north-west Pacific for a 2.2°C SST
warming (Knutson and Tuleya, 1999). The RCM study of idealised tropical cyclones (in the South Pacific) showed a small, but
not statistically significant, increase in maximum intensity (Walsh and Ryan, 2000). These results are supported by the theory of
the maximum potential intensity (MPI) of hurricanes (Emanuel, 1987). A calculation using the MPI framework of Holland (1997)
suggested increases of 10 to 20% for a 2*CO) climate (Henderson-Sellers et al., 1998). This study also acknowledges physical
omissions that would reduce this estimate though Emanuel (2000) suggests there is a linear relationship betweeen MPI and the
wind speed of real events. Published modelling studies to date neglect the possible feedback of sea surface cooling induced by
the cyclone. However, a recently submitted study using a hurricane model with ocean coupling indicates that the increased
maximum intensity by CO, warming would still occur even when the sea surface cooling feedback is included (Knutson et al.,
2000).

tion (Knutson et al., 1998); inserting idealised tropical cyclones into an RCM climate change simulation (Walsh and Ryan, 2000).

In an early use of a high-resolution AGCM, a T106 ECHAM3 experiment simulated a decrease in tropical cyclones in the
Northern Hemisphere and a reduction of 50% in the Southern Hemisphere (Bengtsson et al., 1996, 1997). However, the different
hemispheric responses raised questions about the model’s ability to properly represent tropical cyclones and methodological
concerns about the experimental design were raised (Landsea, 1997). In a similar experiment, the JMA model also simulated
fewer tropical cyclone-like vortices in both hemispheres (Yoshimura et al., 1999). Other GCM studies have shown consistent
basin-dependent changes in tropical cyclone formation under 2CO, conditions (Royer et al., 1998; Tsutsui et al., 1999).
Frequencies increased in the north-west Pacific, decreased in the North Atlantic, and changed little in the south-west Pacific. A
high resolution HadAM3a simulation reproduced the latter changes, giving changes in timing in the north-west Pacific and
increases in frequency in the north-east Pacific and the north Indian basin (McDonald, 1999). Some GCM studies show increases
in tropical storm intensity in a warmer climate (Krishnamurti ef a/., 1998) though these results can probably not be extrapolated
to tropical cyclones as the horizontal resolution of these models is insufficient to resolve the cyclone eye. The likely mean
response of tropical Pacific sea surface warming having an El Nifio-like structure suggests that the pattern of tropical cyclone
frequency may become more like that observed in El Nifio years (see Chapter 9).

Many aspects of the models’ dynamics and large-scale flow

geographically or across models. Some models also demonstrate
improvements in their surface climatologies at higher resolution.
However, substantial underlying errors are often still present in
high-resolution versions of current AGCMs. In addition, the

Regional responses currently appear more sensitive to the

the small number of studies carried out imply that little

provided by high and variable resolution AGCM simulations. The
improvements seen with this technique are encouraging, but
more effort should be put in analysing, and possibly improving

larger north-south gradient in winter (Figure 10.9). These differ-
ences result mainly from the ARPEGE large-scale flow being too
zonal and too strong over mainland Europe, which enhances the
moderating influence of the SSTs. The precipitation responses

large positive summer surface temperature bias in the T106

surface insolation and summer dryness. This mechanism

In a similar experiment, Had AMBa z at 1.25°X0.83° resolu-

HadCM3 GHG simulation and produced a response at the largest
scales in the annual mean similar to the AOGCM (Johns, 1999).
However, regionally or seasonally, many differences were
evident in the two models, notably in land sea contrasts, monsoon
precipitation and some circulation features. Over Europe, large-
scale responses in surface temperature and precipitation were
similar except for a larger winter surface warming in northern
Europe in HadCM3. This was due to a greater melting back of
Arctic sea ice which was too extensive in the HadCM3 control
(Jones, 1999). In a 30-year ECHAM4 T106 experiment driven by
ECHAMA4/OPYC simulations for 1970 to 1999 and 2060 to
2089, the simulations of future climate were more similar to each
other than those for the present day (May, 1999). This implies
that the differences in the control simulations would determine a
proportion of the difference in the responses. In these cases better
control simulations at high resolution increase the confidence in
their responses.

Often a serious problem in RCM evaluation is the lack of
good quality high-resolution observed data. In many regions,
observations are extremely sparse or not readily available. In
addition, only little work has been carried out on how to use point
measurements to evaluate the grid-box mean values from a
climate model, especially when using sparse station networks or
stations in complex topographical terrain (e.g., Osborn and
Hulme, 1997). Most of the observational data available at typical
RCM resolution (order of 50 km) is for precipitation and daily
minimum and maximum temperature. While these fields have

Surface forcing due to land, ocean and sea ice greatly affects
regional climate simulation (e.g., Giorgi et al., 1996; Seth and
Giorgi, 1998; Wei and Fu, 1998; Christensen, 1999; Pan er al.,
1999; Pielke er al., 1999; Rinke and Dethloff, 1999; Chase et al.,
2000; Maslanik et al., 2000, Rummukainen er al., 2000). In
particular, RCM experiments do not start with equilibrium
conditions and therefore the initialisation of surface variables,
such as soil moisture and temperature, is important. For example,
to reach equilibrium it can require a few seasons for the rooting
zone (about | m depth) and years for the deep soils (Christensen,
1999).

The choice of RCM resolution can modulate the effects of
physical forcings and parametrizations (Giorgi and Marinucci,
1996a; Laprise et al., 1998). The description of the hydrologic
cycle generally improves with increasing resolution due to the
better topographical representation (Christensen ef al., 1998;
Leung and Ghan, 1998). Resolving more of the spectrum of
atmospheric motions at high resolution improves the representa-
tion of cyclonic systems and vertical velocities, but can
sometimes worsen aspects of the model climatology
(Machenhauer et al., 1998; Kato et al., 1999). Different resolu-
tions may be required to capture relevant forcings in different
sub-regions, which can be achieved via multiple one-way nesting
(Christensen et al., 1998; McGregor et al., 1999), two-way
nesting (Liston ef al., 1999) or smoothly varying horizontal grids
(Qian and Giorgi, 1999). Only limited studies of the effects of
changing vertical resolution have been published (Kato et al.,
1999).

"RCM model physics configurations are derived either from a
pre-existing (and well tested) limited area model system with
modifications suitable for climate application (Pielke et al., 1992;

GCM (McGregor and Walsh, 1993; Jones et al., 1995; Christensen
et al., 1996; Laprise er al., 1998). In the first approach, each set of
parametrizations is developed and optimised for the respective
model resolutions. However, this makes interpreting differences
between nested model and driving GCM more difficult, as these
will not result only from changes in resolution. Also, the different
model physics schemes may result in inconsistencies near the
boundaries (Machenhauer et al., 1998; Rummukainen ef al., 2000).
The second approach maximises compatibility between the
models. However, physics schemes developed for coarse resolution
GCMs may not be adequate for the high resolutions used in nested
regional models and may, at least, require recalibration (Giorgi and
Marinucci, 1996a; Laprise et al., 1998; see also Section 10.4).
Overall, both strategies have shown performance of similar quality
(e.g., IPCC, 1996), and either one may be preferable (Giorgi and
Mearns, 1999). In the context of climate change simulations, if
there is no resolution dependence, the second approach may be
preferable to maximise consistency between RCM and GCM
responses to the radiative forcing.

"Simulations of current climate conditions serve to evaluate the
performance of RCMs. Since the SAR, a vast number of such
simulations have been conducted (McGregor, 1997; Appendices
10.1 to 10.3). These fall into two categories, RCMs driven by
observed (or “perfect”) boundary conditions and RCMs driven
by GCM boundary conditions. Observed boundary conditions are
derived from Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) analyses
(e.g., European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecast
(ECMWF) reanalysis, Gibson et al. 1997; or National Center for
Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis, Kalnay ef al.,
1996). Over most regions they give accurate representation of the
large-scale flow and tropospheric temperature structure (Gibson
et al., 1997), although errors are still present due to poor data
coverage and to observational uncertainty. The analyses may be
used to drive RCM simulations for short periods, for comparison
with individual episodes, or over long periods to allow statistical
evaluation of the model climatology. Comparison with climatolo-
gies is the only available evaluation tool for RCMs driven by
GCM fields, with the caveats applied to GCM validation
concerning the influence of sample size and decadal variability
(see Sections 10.2, 10.3, and 10.4). Despite these, relatively short
simulations (several years) can identify major systematic RCM
biases if they yield departures from observations significantly
greater than the observed natural variability (Machenhauer et al.,
1996, 1998; Christensen et al., 1997; Jones et al., 1999).

Horizontal resolution is especially important for the simula-

only at a very high resolution do the mountain chains in Norway

A list of published RCM simulations driven by analyses of
observations is given in Appendix 10.1. Many of these studies
present regional differences (or biases) of seasonally or monthly-
averaged surface air temperature and precipitation from observed
values. They indicate that current RCMs can reproduce average
observations over regions of size 10° to 10° km? with errors
generally below 2°C and within 5 to 50% of observed precipita-
tion, respectively (Giorgi and Shields, 1999; Small et al., 1999a,b;
van Lipzig, 1999; Pan et al., 2000). Uncertainties in the analysis
fields, used to drive the models, and, in the observed station data
sets, should be considered in the interpretation of these biases.

The role of the high-resolution forcing was clearly
demonstrated in the study of Noguer et al. (1998), which showed
that the skill in simulating the mesoscale component of the climate
signal (Giorgi et al., 1994; Jones et al., 1995) was little sensitive
to the quality of the driving data (Noguer et al., 1998). On the
other hand, interactions between the large-scale driving data and
high resolution RCM forcings can have negative effects. In
simulations over the European region of Machenauer et al. (1998),
the increased shelter due to the better-resolved mountains in the
RCMs caused an intensification of the GCM-simulated
excessively dry and warm summer conditions over south-eastern
Europe.

The regionally averaged biases in the nested RCMs are not
necessarily smaller than those in the driving GCMs. However, all
the experiments mentioned above, along with those of Leung et
al. (1999a,b), Laprise et al. (1998), Christensen er al. (1998) and
Machenhauer et al. (1998) clearly show that the spatial patterns
produced by the nested RCMs are in better agreement with
observations because of the better representation of high-resolu-
tion topographical forcings and improved land/sea contrasts. For
example, in simulations over Europe and central USA, Giorgi
and Marinucci (1996a) and Giorgi et al. (1998) find correlation
coefficients between simulated and observed seasonally averaged
precipitation in the range of +0.53 to +0.87 in a nested RCM and

RCM as, for example, clearly shown by Noguer et al. (1998).
However, since the SAR, regional biases of seasonal surface air
temperature and precipitation have been reduced and are mostly
within 2°C, and 50 to 60% of observations (with exceptions in all

Organised synoptic-scale precipitation systems were well

Despite the limitations in simulation length, most RCM
experiments clearly indicate that, while the large-scale patterns of
surface climate change in the nested and driving models are
similar, the mesoscale details of the simulated changes can be
quite different. For example, significantly different patterns of
temperature and rainfall changes were found in a regional climate

The high resolution representation of mountainous areas in
an RCM has made it possible to show that the simulated surface
air temperature change signal due to 2 CO, concentration could
have a marked elevation dependency, resulting in more
pronounced warming at high elevations than low elevations as
shown in Figure 10.15 (Giorgi et al., 1997). This is primarily
caused by a depletion of the snow pack in enhanced GHG
conditions and the associated snow albedo feedback mechanism,
and it is consistent with observed temperature trends for
anomalous warm winters over the alpine region. A similar
elevation modulation of the climate change signal has been
confirmed in later studies utilising both RCMs and GCMs (e.g.,

Overall, the evidence is strong that regional models consis-

to GCMs because of their better representation of sub-GCM grid
scale forcings, especially in regard to the surface hydrologic

climate. The increased resolution of RCMs also allows the
simulation of a broader spectrum of weather events, in particular
concerning higher order climate statistics such as daily precipi-
tation intensity distributions. Analysis of some RCM experi-
ments indicate that this is in the direction of increased agreement

with observations.

"Several RCM studies have been important for
understanding climate change processes, such as the elevation
signature of the climate change signal or the effect of climate
change at the river catchment level. However, a consistent set of
RCM simulations of climate change for different regions which
can be used as climate change scenarios for impact work is still
not available. Most RCM climate change simulations have been
sensitivity and process studies aimed at specific goals. The need
is there to co-ordinate RCM simulation efforts and to extend
studies to more regions so that ensemble simulations with
different models and scenarios can be developed to provide
useful information for impact assessments. This will need to be
achieved under the auspices of international or large national
programmes. Within this context, an important issue is to
provide RCM simulations of increasing length to minimise
limitations due to sampling problems.

"Since the SAR, significant improvements have been achieved in
the areas of development and understanding of the nested
regional climate modelling technique. These include many new
RCM systems, multiple nesting, coupling with different
components of the climate system and research into the effects of
domain size, resolution, boundary forcing and internal model
variability. As a result, a number of RCM systems are currently
available with the capability of high-resolution, multi-decadal
simulations in a variety of regional settings. Nested RCMs have
shown marked improvements in their ability to reproduce present
day average climate, with some of this improvement due to better
quality driving fields provided by GCMs. Seasonal temperature
and precipitation biases in state-of-the-art RCMs are generally
less than | to 2°C and a few percent to 50 to 60 % of observed
precipitation, respectively, over regions of size 10° to 10° km”.
However, it is imperative for the effective use of RCMs in climate
change work that the quality of GCM large-scale driving fields
continues to improve. Research aiming at reducing systematic
errors in both GCMs and RCMs should be carried out. With
significantly improved model systems the evidence, so far,
indicates that improved regional climate change simulations can
be produced in the near future.

The more common transfer functions are derived from regres-
sion-like techniques or piecewise linear or non-linear interpola-
tions. The simplest approach is to build multiple regression
models with free atmosphere grid-cell values as predictors for
surface variables such as local temperatures (e.g., Sailor and Li,
1999). Other regression models have used fields of spatially
distributed variables (e.g., D. Chen ef al., 1999), principal
components of geopotential height fields (e.g., Hewitson and
Crane, 1992), Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and a
variant termed redundancy analysis (WASA, 1998) and Singular
Value Decomposition (e. S von 1 Storch and Zwiers, 1999).

Tn addition to statistical models of precipitation frequency
and intensity, weather generators usually produce time-series of
other variables, most commonly maximum and minimum
temperature, and solar radiation. Others also include additional
variables such as relative humidity and wind speed (Wallis and
Griffiths, 1997; Parlange and Katz, 2000.) The most common
means of including variables other than precipitation is to
condition them on the occurrence of precipitation (Richardson,
1981), most often via a multiple variable first-order autoregres-
sive process (Perica and Foufoula-Georgiou, 1996a,b; Wilks,
1999b). The parameters of the weather generator can be
conditioned upon a large-scale state (see Katz and Parlange,
1996; Wilby, 1998; Charles et al., 1999a), or relationships
between large-scale parameter sets and local-scale parameters
can be developed (Wilks, 1999b).

Weather generators are statistical models of observed sequences
of weather variables (Wilks and Wilby, 1999). Most of them
focus on the daily time-scale, as required by many impact
models, but sub-daily models are also available (e.g., Katz and
Parlange, 1995). Various types of daily weather generators are
available, based on the approach to modelling daily precipitation
occurrence, and usually these rely on stochastic processes. Two
of the more common are the Markov chain approach (e.g.,
Richardson, 1981; Hughes et al., 1993, Lettenmaier, 1995;
Hughes et al., 1999; Bellone et al., 2000) and the spell length
approach (Roldan and Woolhiser, 1982; Racksko ef al., 1991;
Wilks, 1999a). The adequacy of the stochastic models analysed
in these studies varied with the climate characteristics of the
locations. For example, Wilks (1999a) found the first-order
Markov model to be adequate for the central and eastern USA,
but that spell length models performed better in the western USA.
An alternative approach would include stochastic mechanisms of
storm arrivals able to produce the clustering found in observed
sequences (e.g., Smith and Karr, 1985; Foufoula-Georgiou and
Lettenmeier, 1986; Gupta and Waymrie, 1991; Cowpertwait and
O’Connel, 1997; O*Connell, 1999).

¢ The predictors are variables of relevance to the local climate
variable being derived, and are realistically modelled by the
GCM. Tropospheric quantities such as temperature or
geopotential height are more skilfully represented than
derived variables such as precipitation at the regional or grid
scale (e.g., Osborn and Hulme, 1997; Trigo and Palutikof,
1999). Furthermore, there is no theoretical level of spatial
aggregation at which GCMs can be considered skilful,
though there is evidence that this is several grid lengths
(Widmann and Bretherton, 2000).

¢ The transfer function is valid under altered climatic
conditions (see Section 10.6.2.2). This cannot be proven in
advance, as it would require the observational record to span
all possible future realisations of the predictors. However, it
could be evaluated with nested AOGCM/RCM simulations
of present and future climate, using the simulation of present
climate to determine the downscaling function and testing
the function against the future time slice.

¢ The predictors fully represent the climate change signal.
Most downscaling approaches to date have relied entirely on
circulation-based predictors and, therefore, can only capture
this component of the climate change. More recently other
important predictors, e.g., atmospheric humidity, have been
considered (e.g., Charles et al., 1999b; Hewitson, 1999).

A diverse range of downscaling methods has been developed,
but, in principle, these models are based on three techniques:

¢ Weather generators, which are random number generators of
realistic looking sequences of local climate variables, and
may be conditioned upon the large-scale atmospheric state
(Section 10.6.2.1);

GCM results of a multi-year climate period are disaggregated into
non-overlapping multi-day episodes of quasi-stationary large-scale
flow patterns. Similar episodes are then grouped in classes of
different weather types, and, members of these classes are
simulated with an RCM. The RCM results are statistically
evaluated, and the frequency of occurrence of the respective classes
determines their statistical weight. An advantage of the SDD

An alternative to linear regression is piecewise linear or non-
linear interpolation (Brandsma and Buishand, 1997; Buishand
and Brandsma, 1999), for example, the “kriging” tools from
geostatistics (Biau et al., 1999). One application of this approach
is a non-linear model of snow cover duration in Austria derived
from European mean temperature and altitude (Hantel ef al.,
1999). An alternative approach is based on Artificial Neural
Networks (ANNs) that allow the fit of a more general class of
statistical model (Hewitson and Crane, 1996; Trigo and Palutikof,
1999). For example, Crane and Hewitson (1998) apply ANN
downscaling to GCM data in a climate change application over
the west coast of the USA using atmospheric circulation and
humidity as predictors to represent the climate change signal. The
approach was shown to accurately capture the local climate as a
function of atmospheric forcing. In application to GCM data, the
regional results revealed significant differences from the co-
located GCM grid cell, e.g., a significant summer increase in
precipitation in the downscaled data (Figure 10.16).

shown to be incorporated in a GCM (Busuioc et al., 1999) and
a RCM (Charles et al., 1999b). Then a climatic change due to
doubling of CO, was estimated through the empirical link and

The classical validation approach is to specify the
downscaling technique from a segment of available observa-

empirical model by comparing its predictions with independent
observed values. This approach is particularly valuable when
the observational record is long and documents significant
changes (greater than 50 years in some cases; Hanssen-Bauer
and Ferland (1998, 2000)). An example is the analysis of
absolute pressure tendencies in the North Atlantic (Kaas et al.,

Transfer function “approaches and some weather typing methods
suffer from an under prediction of temporal variability, as this is
related only in part to the large-scale climate variations (see Katz
and Parlange, 1996). Two approaches have been used to restore
the level of variability: inflation and randomisation. In the
inflation approach the variation is increased by the multiplication
of a suitable factor (Karl et al., 1990). A more sophisticated
version is “expanded downscaling”, a variant of Canonical
Correlation Analysis that ensures the right level of variability
(Biirger, 1996; Huth, 1999; Dehn et al., 2000). In the randomisa-
tion approachs, the unrepresented variability is added as noise,
possibly conditioned on synoptic state (Buma and Dehn, 1998;

Often weather generators have difficulty in representing low
frequency variance, and conditioning the generator parameters
on the large-scale state may alleviate this problem (see Katz and
Parlange, 1996; Wilby, 1998; Charles et al., 1999a). For
example, Katz and Parlange (1993, 1996) modelled daily time-
series of precipitation as a chain-dependent process, conditioned
on a discrete circulation index. The results demonstrated that the
mean and standard deviation of intensity and the probability of
precipitation varied significantly with the circulation, and
reproduced the precipitation variance statistics of the observa-
tions better than the unconditioned model. The method describes
the mean precipitation as a linear function of the circulation
state, and the standard deviation as a non-linear function (Figure
10.18).

The “choice of the predictor variables is of utmost
importance. For example, Hewitson and Crane (1996) and
Hewitson (1999) have demonstrated how the down-scaled
projection of future change in mean precipitation and extreme
events may alter significantly depending on whether or not
humidity is included as a predictor. The downscaled results can
also depend on whether absolute or relative humidity is used as
a predictor (Charles et al., 1999b). The implication here is that
while a predictor may or may not appear as the most signifi-
cant when developing the downscaling function under present
climates, the changes in that predictor under a future climate
may be critical for determining the climate change. Some
estimation procedures, for example stepwise regression, are
not able to recognise this and exclude variables that may be
vital for climate change.

A number of analyses have dealt with the relative merits of
non-linear and linear approaches. For example, the relationships
between daily precipitation and circulation indicators are often
non-linear (Conway et al., 1996; Brandsma and Buishand, 1997).
Similarly, Corte-Real et al. (1995) applied multivariate adaptive
regression splines (MARS) to approximate the non-linear
relationships between large-scale circulation and monthly mean
precipitation. In a comparison of kriging and analogues, Biau et
al. (1999) and von Storch (1999c) show that kriging resulted in
better specifications of averaged quantities but too low variance,
whereas analogues returned the right variance but lower correla-
tion. In general, it appears that downscaling of the short-term
climate variance benefits from the use of non-linear models.

local temperature during the 20th century could only partly be
related to changes in circulation. Schubert (1998) makes a vital
point in noting that changes of local temperature under doubled
atmospheric CO, may be dominated by changes in the radiative
properties of the atmosphere rather than circulation changes.
These can be accounted for by incorporating the large-scale
temperature field from the GCM as a surrogate indicator of the
changed radiative properties of the atmosphere (Dehn and Buma,
1999) or by using several large-scale predictors, such as gridded

Prior to this the empirical evidence about the co-variability of

Therefore, statistical downscaling techniques are suitable tools

with little experience in process-based climate modelling.
Furthermore, statistical techniques may relate directly GCM-
derived data to impact relevant variables, such as ecological
variables or ocean wave heights, which are not simulated by

"Downscaling means post-processing GCM data; it cannot
account for insufficiencies in the driving GCM. As statistical
techniques combine the existing empirical knowledge, statistical
downscaling can describe only those links that have been observed

links will prevail under different climate conditions. It may be, in
particular, that under present conditions some predictors appear
less relevant, but become significant in describing climate change.
It is recommended to test statistical downscaling methods by
comparing their estimates with high resolution dynamical model

Unified Model (UM) RCM over Europe against a statistical
downscaling model based on regression. Monthly mean surface
temperature and precipitation anomalies were down-scaled using
predictor sets chosen from a range of candidate variables similar
to those used by Kidson and Thompson (1998) (EOFs of
atmospheric fields). The results showed similar levels of skill for
the dynamical and statistical methods, in line with the Kidson and
Thompson (1998) study. The statistical method was nominally
better for summertime estimates of temperature, while the
dynamical model gave better estimates of wintertime precipita-
tion. Again, the conclusion was drawn that the sophistication of
the dynamical model shows little advantage over statistical
techniques, at least for present day cl climates.

Kidson and Thompson (1998) compared the RAMS
(Regional Atmospheric Modelling System) dynamical model and
a statistical regression-based technique. Both approaches were
applied to downscale reanalysis data (ECMWF) over New
Zealand to a grid resolution of 50 km. The statistical downscaling
used a screening regression technique to predict local minimum
and maximum temperature and daily precipitation, at both
monthly and daily time-scales. The regression technique limits
each regression equation to five predictors (selected from
Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) of atmospheric fields).
Both monthly and daily results indicated little difference in skill
between the two techniques, and Kidson and Thompson (1998)
suggested that, subject to the assumption of statistical relation-
ships remaining viable under a future climate, the computational
requirements do not favour the use of the dynamical model. They
also noted, however, that the dynamical model performed better

with the convective components of precipitation.

Mearns et al. (1999) compared RCM simulations and statis-
tical downscaling using a regional model and a semi-empirical
technique based on stochastic procedures conditioned on weather
types which were classified from circulation fields (700hPa
geopotential heights). While Mearns et al. suggest that the semi-
empirical approach incorporates more physical meaning into the
relationships than a pure statistical approach does, this approach
does impose the assumption that the circulation patterns are
robust into a future climate in addition to the normal assumption
that the cross-scale relationships are stationary in time. For both
techniques, the driving fields were from the CSIRO AOGCM
(Watterson er al., 1995). The variables of interest were maximum
and minimum daily temperature and precipitation over central-
northern USA (Nebraska). As with the preceding studies, the
validation under present climate conditions indicated similar skill
levels for the dynamical and statistical approaches, with some
advantage by the statistical technique.

"Murphy (2000) continued the comparative study by deriving
climate change projections for 2080 to 2100 from a simulation
with the HadCM2 AOGCM. The dynamical and statistical
downscaling techniques were the same regional and statistical
models as used by Murphy (1999). The statistical and dynamical
techniques produced significantly different predictions of climate
change, despite exhibiting similar skill when validated against
present day observations. The study identifies two main sources of
divergence between the dynamical and statistical techniques:
firstly, differences between the strength of the observed and
simulated predictor/predictand relationships, and secondly,
omission from the regression equations of variables which
represent climate change feedbacks, but are weak predictors of
natural variability. In particular, the exclusion of specific humidity
led to differences between the dynamical and statistical simulations
of precipitation change. This point would seem to confirm the
humidity issue raised in Section 10.6.3 (Hewitson and Crane 1996,
Crane and Hewitson, 1998, Charles et al., 1999b; Hewitson 1999).

Analysis of AOGCM simulations for broad (sub-continental
scale) regions indicates that biases in the simulation of present
day regionally and seasonally averaged surface climate variables,
although highly variable across regions and models, are generally
improved compared with the previous generation models. This
implies increased confidence in simulated climatic changes. The
performance of models in reproducing observed interannual
variability varies across regions and models.

"Work performed with all regionalisation techniques
indicates that sub-GCM grid scale structure in the regional
climate change signal can occur in response to regional and local
forcings, although more work is needed to assess the statistical
significance of the sub-GCM grid scale signal. In particular,
modelling evidence clearly indicates that topography, land use
and the surface hydrologic cycle strongly affect the surface
climate change signal at the regional to local scale. This implies
that the use of AOGCM information for impact studies needs to
be taken cautiously, especially in regions characterised by
pronounced sub-GCM grid scale variability in forcings, and that
suitable regionalisation techniques should be used to enhance the
AOGCM results over these regions.

"Regional analysis of AOGCM transient simulations
extending to 2100, for different scenarios of GHG increase and
sulphate aerosol effects, and with a number of modelling
systems (some simulations include ensembles of realisations)
indicate that the average climatic changes for the late decades of
the 21st century compared to present day climate vary substan-
tially across regions and models. The primary source of
uncertainty in the simulated changes is associated with inter-
model range of changes, with inter-scenario and intra-ensemble
range of simulated changes being less pronounced. Despite the
range of inter-model results, some common patterns of sub-
continental scale climatic changes are emerging, and thus
providing increased confidence in the simulation of these
changes.

Overall, the above comparative studies indicate that for
present climate both techniques have similar skill. Since statis-
tical models are based on observed relationships between predic-
tands and predictors, this result may represent a further validation
of the performance of RCMs. Under future climate conditions
more differences are found between the techniques, and the
question arises as to which is “more correct”. While the
dynamical model should clearly provide a better physical basis
for change, it is still unclear whether different regional models
generate similar downscaled changes. With regard to statis-
tical/empirical techniques, it would seem that careful attention
must be given to the choice of predictors, and that methodologies
which internally select predictors based on explanatory power
under present climates may exclude predictors important for
determining change under future climate modes.

Since the SAR, substantial progress has been achieved in all
regionalisation methods, including better understanding of the
techniques, development of a wide variety of modelling systems
and methods, application of the techniques to a wide range of
studies and regional settings, and reduction of model biases.
Modelling work has indicated that regionalisation techniques
enhance some aspects of AOGCM regional information, such as
the high resolution spatial detail of precipitation and temperature,
and the statistics of daily precipitation events. It is important to
stress that AOGCM information is the starting point for the
application of all regionalisation techniques, so that a foremost
requirement in the simulation of regional climate change is that
the AOGCMs simulate well the circulation features that affect
regional climates. In this respect, indications are that the perform-

ance of current AOGCMs is generally improving.

Extending the comparison beyond simple methodological
performance, Wilby et al. (2000) compared hydrological
responses using data from dynamically and statistically down-
scaled climate model output for the Animas River basin in
Colorado, USA. While not a climate change projection, the use
of output from an RCM and a statistical downscaling approach to
drive a distributed hydrological model exemplify the objective of
the downscaling. The results indicate that both the statistical and
dynamical methods had greater skill (in terms of modelling
hydrology) than the coarse resolution reanalysis output used to
drive the downscaling. The statistical method had the advantage
of requiring very few parameters, an attribute making the
procedure attractive for many hydrological applications. The
dynmical model output, once elevation-corrected, provided better
water balance estimates than raw or elevation-corrected
reanalysis output.

"In line with the Murphy (2000) study, larger differences were
also noted by Mearns ef al. (1999) when climate change projec-
tions were produced. Notably for temperature, the statistical
technique produced an amplified seasonal cycle compared to
both the RCM and CSIRO data, although similar changes in daily
temperature variances were found in both the RCM and the statis-
tical technique (with the statistical approach producing mostly
decreases). The spatial patterns of change showed greater
variability in the RCM compared with the statistical technique.
Mearns et al. (1999) suggested that some of the differences found
in the results were due to the climate change simulation
exceeding the range of data used to develop the statistical model,
while the decreases in variance were likely to be a true reflection
of changes in the circulation controls. The precipitation results
from Mearns et al. (1999) are different from earlier studies with
the same RCM (e.g., Giorgi et al., 1998) that produced few statis-
tically significant changes.

The combined use of different techniques may provide the
most suitable approach in many instances. For example, a high-
resolution AGCM simulation could represent an important
intermediate step between AOGCM information and RCM or
statistical downscaling models. The convergence of results from
different approaches applied to the same problem can increase
the confidence in the results and differences between
approaches can help to understand the behaviour of the models.

Despite recent improvements and developments, regional-
isation research is still a maturing process and the related
uncertainties are still rather poorly known. One of the reasons
for this is that most regionalisation research activities have
been carried out independently of each other and aimed at
specific objectives. Therefore a coherent picture of regional
climate change via available regionalisation techniques cannot
yet be drawn. More co-ordinated efforts are thus necessary to
improve the integrated hierarchy of models, evaluate the
different methodologies, intercompare methods and models
and apply these methods to climate change research in a
comprehensive strategy.
"	Text
"Considerations of various types may enter the choice of
the regionalisation technique, as different techniques may be
most suitable for different applications and different working
environments. High resolution AGCMs offer the primary
advantage of global coverage and two-way interactions
between regional and global climate. However, due to their
computational cost, the resolution increase that can be
expected from these models is limited. Variable resolution and
RCMs yield a greater increase in resolution, with current
RCMs reaching resolutions as fine as a few tens of kilometres
or less. RCMs can capture physical processes and feedbacks
occurring at the regional scale, but they are affected by the
errors of the AOGCM driving fields, and they do not represent
regional-to-global climate feedbacks. The effects of regional-
to-global feedback processes depend on the specific problem
and in many cases may not be important. Two-way GCM-RCM
nesting would allow the description of such effects, and some
research efforts in that direction are currently under way.
Statistical downscaling techniques offer the advantages of
being computationally inexpensive, of providing local
information which is needed in many impact applications, and
of offering the possibility of being tailored to specific applica-

upper bound (2.0 mm/yr), but the central value is less than the
observational lower bound (1.0 mm/yr), ie., the sum of

"¢ Since the Last Glacial Maximum about 20,000 years ago, sea
level has risen by over 120 m at locations far from present and
former ice sheets, as a result of loss of mass from these ice
sheets. There was a rapid rise between 15,000 and 6,000 years
ago at an average rate of 10 mm/yr.

¢ Based on geological data, global average sea level may have
risen at an average rate of about 0.5 mm/yr over the last 6,000
years and at an average rate of 0.1 to 0.2 mm/yr over the last
3,000 years.

¢ Vertical land movements are still occurring today as a result of
these large transfers of mass from the ice sheets to the ocean.

¢ During the last 6,000 years, global average sea level variations
on time-scales of a few hundred years and longer are likely to
have been less than 0.3 to 0.5 m.

¢ Based on tide gauge data, the rate of global average sea level rise
during the 20th century is in the range 1.0 to 2.0 mm/yr, with a
central value of 1.5 mm/yr (as with other ranges of uncertainty,
it is not implied that the central value is the best estimate).

rate of sea level rise has been larger during the 20th century
than the 19th century.

Current ice dynamic models project that the WAIS will
contribute no more than 3 mm/yr to sea level rise over the next

Our confidence in the regional distribution of sea level
change from AOGCMs is low because there is little similarity
between models. However, models agree on the qualitative
conclusion that the range of regional variation is substantial
compared with the global average sea level rise. Nearly all
models project greater than average rise in the Arctic Ocean and
less than average rise in the Southern Ocean.

The West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) has attracted special
attention because it contains enough ice to raise sea level by 6
m and because of suggestions that instabilities associated with
its being grounded below sea level may result in rapid ice
discharge when the surrounding ice shelves are weakened. The
range of projections given above makes no allowance for ice-
dynamic instability of the WAIS. It is now widely agreed that
major loss of grounded ice and accelerated sea level rise are
very unlikely during the 21st century.

Ice sheets will continue to react to climate change during

the next several thousand years even if the climate is stabilised.
Models project that a local annual-average warming of larger
than 3°C sustained for millennia would lead to virtually a
complete melting of the Greenland ice sheet. For a warming over
Greenland of 5.5°C, consistent with mid-range stabilisation
scenarios, the Greenland ice sheet contributes about 3 m in 1,000
years. For a warming of 8°C, the contribution is about 6 m, the
ice sheet being largely eliminated. For smaller warmings, the
decay of the ice sheet would be substantially slower.

For the 35 SRES scenarios, we project a sea level rise of
0.09 to 0.88 m for 1990 to 2100, with a central value of 0.48 m.
The central value gives an average rate of 2.2 to 4.4 times the
rate over the 20th century. If terrestrial storage continued at its
present rates, the projections could be changed by —0.21 to
+0.11 m. For an average AOGCM, the SRES scenarios give
results which differ by 0.02 m or less for the first half of the 21st
century. By 2100, they vary over a range amounting to about
50% of the central value. Beyond the 21st century, sea level rise

will depend strongly on the emissions scenario.

Apart from the possibility of an internal ice dynamic instability,
surface melting will affect the long-term viability of the Antarctic
ice sheet. For warmings of more than 10°C, simple runoff models
predict that a zone of net mass loss would develop on the ice sheet
surface. Irreversible disintegration of the WAIS would result
because the WAIS cannot retreat to higher ground once its margins
are subjected to surface melting and begin to recede. Such a disinte-
gration would take at least a few millennia. Thresholds for total
disintegration of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet by surface melting
involve warmings above 20°C, a situation that has not occurred for
at least 15 million years and which is far more than predicted by any
scenario of climate change currently under consideration.

We estimate that global average eustatic sea level change
over the last hundred years is within the range 0.10 to 0.20 m
(Section 11.3.2). (“Eustatic” change is that which is caused by
an alteration to the volume of water in the world ocean.) These
values are somewhat higher than the sum of the predictions of
the contributions to sea level rise (Section 11.4). The discrep-
ancy reflects the imperfect state of current scientific knowledge.
In an attempt to quantify the processes and their associated rates
of sea level change, we have critically evaluated the error
estimates (Box 11.1). However, the uncertainties remain
substantial, although some have narrowed since the SAR on

"Sea level change is an important consequence of climate
change, both for societies and for the environment. In this
chapter, we deal with the measurement and physical causes of
sea level change, and with predictions for global-average and
regional changes over the next century and further into the
future. We reach qualitatively similar conclusions to those of
Warrick et al. (1996) in the IPCC WGI Second Assessment
Report (IPCC, 1996) (hereafter SAR). However, improved
measurements and advances in modelling have given more
detailed information and greater confidence in several areas.
The impacts of sea level change on the populations and eco-
systems of coastal zones are discussed in the IPCC WGII TAR

"Eustatic sea level change results from changes to the density
or to the total mass of water. Both of these relate to climate.
Density is reduced by thermal expansion occurring as the ocean
warms. Observational estimates of interior temperature changes
in the ocean reported by Warrick et al. (1996) were limited, and
estimates of thermal expansion were made from simple ocean
models. Since the SAR, more observational analyses have been
made and estimates from several Atmosphere-Ocean General
Circulation Models (AOGCMs) have become available (Section
11.2.1). Thermal expansion is expected to contribute the largest
component to sea level rise over the next hundred years (Section
11.5.1.1). Because of the large heat capacity of the ocean, thermal
expansion would continue for many centuries after climate had
been stabilised (Section 11.5.4.1).

Exchanges with w water stored c on land will alter the mass of the
ocean. (Note that sea level would be unaffected by the melting of
sea ice, whose weight is already supported by the ocean.)
Groundwater extraction and impounding water in reservoirs result
in a direct influence on sea level (Section 11.2.5). Climate change
is projected to reduce the amount of water frozen in glaciers and
ice caps (Sections 11.2.2, 11.5.1.1) because of increased melting
and evaporation. Greater melting and evaporation on the
Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets (Sections 11.2.3, 11.5.1.1) is
also projected, but might be outweighed by increased precipita-
tion. Increased discharge of ice from the ice sheets into the ocean
is also possible. The ice sheets react to climate change by
adjusting their shape and size on time-scales of up to millennia, so
they could still be gaining or losing mass as a result of climate
variations over a history extending as far back as the last glacial
period, and they would continue to change for thousands of years
after climate had been stabilised (Section 11.5.4.3).

"“Mean sea level” at the coast is defined as the height of the
sea with respect to a local land benchmark, averaged over a
period of time, such as a month or a year, long enough that
fluctuations caused by waves and tides are largely removed.
Changes in mean sea level as measured by coastal tide gauges
are called “relative sea level changes’, because they can come
about either by movement of the land on which the tide gauge
is situated or by changes in the height of the adjacent sea
surface (both considered with respect to the centre of the Earth
as a fixed reference). These two terms can have similar rates
(several mm/yr) on time-scales greater than decades. To infer
sea level changes arising from changes in the ocean, the
movement of the land needs to be subtracted from the records
of tide gauges and geological indicators of past sea level.
Widespread land movements are caused by the isostatic adjust-
ment resulting from the slow viscous response of the mantle to

The rate of climate change depends strongly on the rate at
which heat is removed from the ocean surface layers into the
ocean interior; if heat is taken up more readily, climate change is
retarded but sea level rises more rapidly. Climate change simula-

in the ocean and the evolution of temperature as a function of

"The pattern of sea level in ocean basins is maintained by
atmospheric pressure and air-sea fluxes of momentum (surface
wind stress), heat and fresh water (precipitation, evaporation, and
fresh-water runoff from the land). The ocean is strongly density
stratified with motion preferentially along density surfaces (e.g.
Ledwell et al., 1993, 1998). This allows properties of water
masses, set by interaction with the atmosphere or sea ice, to be
carried thousands of kilometres into the ocean interior and thus
provides a pathway for warming of surface waters to enter the
ocean interior.

As the ocean warms, the density decreases and thus even at
constant mass the volume of the ocean increases. This thermal
expansion (or steric sea level rise) occurs at all ocean tempera-
tures and is one of the major contributors to sea level changes
during the 20th and 21st centuries. Water at higher temperature or
under greater pressure (i.e., at greater depth) expands more for a
given heat input, so the global average expansion is affected by
the distribution of heat within the ocean. Salinity changes within
the ocean also have a significant impact on the local density and
thus local sea level, but have little effect on global average sea
level change.

"Sea level change is not expected to be geographically
uniform (Section 11.5.2), so information about its distribution is
needed to inform assessments of the impacts on coastal regions.
Since the SAR, such information has been calculated from
several AOGCMs. The pattern depends on ocean surface fluxes,
interior conditions and circulation. The most serious impacts are
caused not only by changes in mean sea level but by changes to
extreme sea levels (Section 11.5.3.2), especially storm surges and
exceptionally high waves, which are forced by meteorological
conditions. Climate-related changes in these therefore also have
to be considered.

A warming of the Atlantic layer in the Arctic Ocean is

deduced by comparison of modern oceanographic sections
collected on board ice-breakers (e.g., Quadfasel et al., 1991;
Carmack et al., 1997; Swift et al., 1997) and submarines (e.g.
Morison et al., 1998; Steele and Boyd, 1998) with Russian Arctic
Ocean atlases compiled from decades of earlier data (Treshnikov,
1977; Gorshkov, 1983). It is not yet clear whether these changes
result from a climate trend or, as argued by Grotefendt ef al.
(1998), from decadal variability. The published studies do not
report estimates of steric sea level changes; we note that a
warming of 1°C over the central 200 m of the Atlantic layer
would result in a local rise of steric sea level of 10 to 20 mm.

"The most convincing evidence of ocean warming is for the
North Atlantic. An almost constant rate of interior warming, with
implied steric sea level rise, is found over 73 years at Ocean
Station S (south-east of Bermuda). Comparisons of trans-ocean
sections show that these changes are widespread (Table 11.1). On
decadal time-scales, variations in surface steric height from
station S compare well with sea level at Bermuda (Roemmich,
1990) and appear to be driven by changes in the wind stress curl
(Sturges and Hong, 1995; Sturges et al., 1998). Variability in the
western North Atlantic (Curry et al., 1998) is related to changes
in convective activity in the Labrador Sea (Dickson et al., 1996).
Over the 20 years up to the early 1990s there has been a cooling
of the Labrador Sea Water (as in the Irminger Sea, Read and
Gould, 1992), and more recently in the western North Atlantic
(Koltermann er al., 1999). For the South Atlantic, changes are
more uncertain, particularly those early in the 20th century.

"Previous IPCC sea level change assessments (Warrick and
Oerlemans, 1990; Warrick er al., 1996) noted that there were a
number of time-series which indicate warming of the ocean and
a resultant thermal expansion (i.e. a steric sea level rise) but there
was limited geographical coverage. Comparison of recent ocean
temperature data sets (particularly those collected during the
World Ocean Circulation Experiment) with historical data is
beginning to reveal large-scale changes in the ocean interior.
(Section 2.2.2.5 includes additional material on ocean warming,
including studies for which there are no estimates of ocean
thermal expansion.) However, the absence of comprehensive
long ocean time-series data makes detection of trends difficult
and prone to contamination by decadal and interannual
variability. While there has been some work on interannual
variability in the North Atlantic (e.g. Levitus, 1989a,b, 1990) and
North Pacific (e.g. Yasuda and Hanawa, 1997; Zhang and
Levitus, 1997), few studies have focused on long-term trends.

expansion over periods during the 20th century are given in

"The advantage of these simple models is that they require
less computing power than AOGCMs and so the sensitivity of
results to a range of uncertainties can easily be examined.
However, the simplifications imply that important processes
controlling the penetration of heat from the surface into the ocean
interior are not reproduced and they cannot provide information
on the regional distribution of sea level rise. The most satisfactory
way of estimating ocean thermal expansion is through the use of
AOGCMs (Chapter 8, Section 8.3) (Gregory, 1993; Cubasch et
al., 1994; Bryan, 1996; Jackett et al., 2000; Russell et al., 2000;

relate particularly to the representation of the effect on mixing by
processes which operate on scales too small to be resolved in
global models, but which may have an important influence on
heat uptake (see Section 8.5.2.2.4). The geographical distribution
of sea level change due to density and circulation changes can be
obtained from AOGCM results (various methods are used; see
Gregory et al., 2001). The ability of AOGCMs to simulate
decadal variability in the ocean interior has not yet been
demonstrated adequately, partly because of the scarcity of
observations of decadal variability in the ocean for testing these

A glacier, ice cap or ice sheet gains mass by accumulation of
snow (snowfall and deposition by wind-drift), which is
gradually transformed to ice, and loses mass (ablation)
mainly by melting at the surface or base with subsequent
runoff or evaporation of the melt water. Some melt water may
refreeze within the snow instead of being lost, and some snow
may sublimate or be blown off the surface. Ice may also be
removed by discharge into a floating ice shelf or glacier
tongue, from which it is lost by basal melting and calving of
icebergs. Net accumulation occurs at higher altitude, net
ablation at lower altitude; to compensate for net accumulation
and ablation, ice flows downhill by internal deformation of
the ice and sliding and bed deformation at the base. The rate
at which this occurs is mainly controlled by the surface slope,
the ice thickness, the effective ice viscosity, and basal thermal
and physical conditions. The mass balance for an individual
body of ice is usually expressed as the rate of change of the
equivalent volume of liquid water, in m?/yr; the mass balance
is zero for a steady state. Mass balances are computed for
both the whole year and individual seasons; the winter mass
balance mostly measures accumulation, the summer, surface
melting. The specific mass balance is the mass balance
averaged over the surface area, in m/yr. A mass balance
sensitivity is the derivative of the specific mass balance with
respect to a climate parameter which affects it. For instance,
a mass balance sensitivity to temperature is in m/yr/°C.

Estimates of the historical global glacier contribution to

measured glaciers into seven major regions and finding the
mass balance for each region, including the glaciers around
the ice sheets. Their area-weighted average for 1961 to 1990
was equivalent to 0.25 + 0.10 mm/yr of sea level rise. Cogley
and Adams (1998) estimated a lower rate for 1961 to 1990.
However, their results may be not be representative of the
global average because they do not make a correction for the
regional biases in the sample of well investigated glaciers

By contrast, specific mass balance is poorly known.
Continuous mass balance records longer than 20 years exist
for about forty glaciers worldwide, and about 100 have records

few have both winter and summer balances; these data are
critical to relating glacier change to climatic elements

practical because no detailed description exists for the great

Changes in ice discharge generally involve response times of
the order of 10? to 10* years. The time-scales are determined by
isostasy, the ratio of ice thickness to yearly mass turnover,
processes affecting ice viscosity, and physical and thermal
processes at the bed. Hence it is likely that the ice sheets are still
adjusting to their past history, in particular the transition to inter-
glacial conditions. Their future contribution to sea level change
therefore has a component resulting from past climate changes as

Dynamic adjustment of glaciers to a new climate occurs over
tens to hundreds of years (Johannesson ef al., 1989), the time-
scale being proportional to the mean glacier thickness divided by
the specific mass balance at the terminus. Since both quantities
are related to the size of the glacier, the time-scale is not
necessarily longer for larger glaciers (Raper et al., 1996; Bahr et
al., 1998), but it tends to be longer for glaciers in continental

Antarctic temperatures are so low that there is virtually no surface

their underside and eventually break up to form icebergs. On the

For Greenland (Table 11.5), runoff is an important term but
net ablation has only been measured directly at a few locations
and therefore has to be calculated from models, which have
considerable sensitivity to the surface elevation data set and the
parameters of the melt and refreezing methods used (Reeh and
Starzer, 1996; Van de Wal, 1996; Van de Wal and Ekholm, 1996;

The above calculations all neglect the change of area that will
accompany loss of volume. Hence they are inaccurate because
reduction of area will restrict the rate of melting. A detailed
computation of transient response with dynamic adjustment to
decreasing glacier sizes is not feasible at present, since the
required information is not available for most glaciers.
Oerlemans ef al. (1998) undertook such detailed modelling of
twelve individual glaciers and ice caps with an assumed rate of
temperature change for the next hundred years. They found that
neglecting the contraction of glacier area could lead to an overes-
timate of net mass loss of about 25% by 2100.

assessed by estimating the individual mass balance terms, and
making the budget. Only the mass balance of the ice sheet resting
on bedrock (the grounded ice sheet) needs to be considered,
because changes in the ice shelves do not affect sea level as they
are already afloat. Recent mass balance estimates for Greenland
and Antarctica are shown in Tables 11.5 and 11.6. Most progress
since the SAR has been made in the assessment of accumulation,
where the major obstacle is poor coverage by in situ measure-

Meier and Bahr (1996) and Bahr ef al. (1997), following
previous workers, proposed that for a glacier or an ice sheet in a
steady state there may exist scaling relationships of the form V
ec A® between the volume V and area A, where c is a constant.
Such relationships seem well supported by the increasing
sample of glacier volumes measured by radio-echo-sounding
and other techniques, despite the fact that climate change may be
occurring on time-scales similar to those of dynamic adjustment.
If one assumes that the volume-area relationship always holds,
one can use it to deduce the area as the volume decreases. This
idea can be extended to a glacier covered region if one knows the
distribution of total glacier area among individual glaciers,
which can be estimated using empirical functions (Meier and
Bahr, 1996; Bahr, 1997). Using these methods, Van de Wal and
Wild (2001) found that contraction of area reduces the estimated
glacier net mass loss over the next 70 years by 15 to 20% (see

Modelling of the past history of the ice sheets and their underlying
beds over a glacial cycle is a way to obtain an estimate of the
present ice-dynamic evolution unaffected by short-term (annual to
decadal) mass-balance effects. The simulation requires time-
dependent boundary conditions (surface mass balance, surface
temperature, and sea level, the latter being needed to model
grounding-line changes). Current glaciological models employ
grids of 20 to 40 km horizontal spacing with 10 to 30 vertical layers
and include ice shelves, basal sliding and bedrock adjustment.

"For Antarctica (Table 11.6), the ice discharge dominates the
uncertainty in the mass balance of the grounded ice sheet,
because of the difficulty of determining the position and
thickness of ice at the grounding line and the need for assump-
tions about the vertical distribution of velocity. The figure of
Budd and Smith (1985) of 1,620x10!? kg/yr is the only available
estimate. Comparing this with an average value of recent
accumulation estimates for the grounded ice sheet would suggest
a positive mass balance of around +10% of the total input,
equivalent to —0.5 mm/yr of sea level. Alternatively, the flux
across the grounding line can be obtained by assuming the ice
shelves to be in balance and using estimates of the calving rate
(production of icebergs), the rate of melting on the (submerged)
underside of the ice shelves, and accumulation on the ice shelves.
This results in a flux of 2,209 + 391x10!"" kg/yr across the
grounding line and a mass balance for the grounded ice equiva-
lent to +1.04 + 1.06 mm/yr of sea level (Table 11.6). However,
the ice shelves may not be in balance, so that the error estimate
probably understates the true uncertainty.

thickening between 1978 and 1988 of 15 + 20 mm/yr of the
Greenland ice sheet above 2,000 m at latitudes up to 72°N.
Krabill et al. (1999) observed a similar pattern above 2,000 m
from 1993 to 1998 using satellite referenced, repeat aircraft laser
altimetry. Together, these results indicate that this area of the
Greenland ice sheet has been nearly in balance for two decades,
in agreement with the mass budget studies mentioned above
(Thomas et al., 2000). Krabill et al. (1999) observed markedly
different behaviour at lower altitudes, with thinning rates in
excess of 2 m/yr in the south and east, which they attributed in
part to excess flow, although a series of warmer-than-average
summers may also have had an influence. In a recent update,
Krabill et al. (2000) find the total ice sheet balance to be
—46x10!? kg/yr or 0.13 mm/yr of sea level rise between 1993 and
1999, but could not provide an error bar. Incidentally, this value
is very close to the century time-scale imbalance derived from the
mass budget studies (Table 11.5), although the time periods are
different and the laser altimetry results do not allow us to distin-

guish between accumulation, ablation, and discharge.

using 3-D models of Greenland and Antarctica, with forcing
derived from the Vostok (Antarctica) and Greenland Ice Core
Project (GRIP) ice cores. The retreat history of the ice sheet along
a transect in central west Greenland in particular was found to be
in good agreement with a succession of dated moraines (Van
Tatenhove et al., 1995), but similar validation elsewhere is limited
by the availability of well-dated material. Similar experiments
were conducted as part of the European Ice Sheet Modelling
Initiative (EISMINT) intercomparison exercise (Huybrechts et al.,
1998). These model simulations suggest that the average
Greenland contribution to global sea level rise has been between
—0.1 and 0.0 mm/yr in the last 500 years, while the Antarctic
contribution has been positive. Four different Antarctic models
yield a sea level contribution of between +0.1 and +0.5 mm/yr
averaged over the last 500 years, mainly due to incomplete
grounding-line retreat of the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS)
since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (Figure 11.3). However,
substantial uncertainties remain, especially for the WAIS, where
small phase shifts in the input sea level time-series and inadequate
representation of ice-stream dynamics may have a significant
effect on the model outcome. Glacio-isostatic modelling of the
solid earth beneath the Antarctic ice sheet with prescribed ice
sheet evolution (James and Ivins, 1998) gave similar uplift rates as
those presented in Huybrechts and Le Meur (1999), indicating
that the underlying ice sheet scenarios and bedrock models were
similar, but observations are lacking to validate the generated
uplift rates. By contrast, Budd et al. (1998) find that Antarctic ice

level lowering because in their modelling the Antarctic ice sheet

The simulations described later (Section 11.5.1.1), in which an
ice sheet model is integrated using changes in temperature and
precipitation derived from AOGCM simulations, suggest that
anthropogenic climate change could have produced an additional
contribution of between —0.2 to 0.0 mm/yr of sea level from
increased accumulation in Antarctica over the last 100 years, and
between 0.0 and 0.1 mm/yr from Greenland, from both increased
accumulation and ablation. The model results for Greenland
exhibit substantial interannual variability. Furthermore, because
of rising temperatures during the 20th century, the contribution
for recent decades is larger than the average for the century.
These points must be borne in mind when comparing with results
of the direct observation methods for short periods in recent
decades (Sections 11.2.3.1 and 11.2.3.2). Note also that the
observational results include the ongoing response to past climate
change as well as the effect of 20th century climate change.

"For Greenland, estimates of the sensitivity to a 1°C local
warming over the ice sheet are close to 0.3 mm/yr (with a total
range of +0.1 to +0.4 mm/yr) of global sea level equivalent. This
range mainly reflects differences in the predicted precipitation
changes and the yearly distribution of the temperature increase,
which is predicted to be larger in winter than in summer in the
GCMs, but is assumed uniform in the studies of Van de Wal
(1996) and Janssens and Huybrechts (2000). Another difference
amongst the GCM results concerns the time window over which
the sensitivities are assessed. The CSIRO9/T63 sensivities are
estimated from high-resolution runs forced with observed SSTs
for the recent past (Smith er al., 1998; Smith, 1999), whereas the
ECHAM data are given as specific mass balance changes for
doubled minus present atmospheric CO. Thompson and Pollard
(1997) report similar results to the ECHAM studies but the
corresponding sensitivity value could not be calculated because
the associated temperature information is not provided. Some
palaeoclimatic data from central Greenland ice cores indicate
that variations in precipitation during the Holocene are related to
changes in atmospheric circulation rather than directly to local
temperature (Kapsner et al., 1995; Cuffey and Clow, 1997), such
that precipitation might not increase with temperature (in
contrast with Clausen et al., 1988). For glacial-interglacial transi-
tions, the ice cores do exhibit a strong positive correlation
between temperature and precipitation (Dansgaard et al., 1993;
Dahl-Jensen et al., 1993; Kapsner et al., 1995; Cuffey and
Marshall, 2000), as simulated by AOGCMs for anthropogenic
warming. Although other changes took place at the glacial-
interglacial transition, this large climate shift could be argued to
be a better analogue for anthropogenic climate change than the
smaller fluctuations of the Holocene. To allow for changes in
circulation patterns and associated temperature and precipitation
patterns, we have used time-dependent AOGCM experiments to
calculate the Greenland contribution (Section 11.5.1).

On time-scales of 10? to 10° years, the most important processes
affecting sea level are those associated with the growth and decay
of the ice sheets through glacial-interglacial cycles. These contri-
butions include the effect of changes in ocean volume and the
response of the earth to these changes. The latter are the glacio-
hydro-isostatic effects: the vertical land movements induced by
varying surface loads of ice and water and by the concomitant
redistribution of mass within the Earth and oceans. While major
melting of the ice sheets ceased by about 6,000 years ago, the
isostatic movements remain and will continue into the future
because the Earth’s viscous response to the load has a time-
constant of thousands of years. Observational evidence indicates
a complex spatial and temporal pattern of the resulting isostatic
sea level change for the past 20,000 years. As the geological
record is incomplete for most parts of the world, models
(constrained by the reliable sea level observations) are required to
describe and predict the vertical land movements and changes in
ocean area and volume. Relative sea level changes caused by
lithospheric processes, associated for example with tectonics and
mantle convection, are discussed in Section 11.2.6.

"In summary, the static sensitivity values suggest a larger
role for Antarctica than for Greenland for an identical local
temperature increase, meaning that the polar ice sheets
combined would produce a sea level lowering, but the spread of
the individual estimates includes the possibility that both ice
sheets may also balance one another for doubled atmospheric
CO), conditions (Ohmura et al., 1996; Thompson and Pollard,
1997). For CO, increasing according to the IS92a scenario
(without aerosol), studies by Van de Wal and Oerlemans (1997)
and Huybrechts and De Wolde (1999) calculated sea level
contributions for 1990 to 2100 of +80 to +100 mm from the
Greenland ice sheet and about -80 mm from the Antarctic ice
sheet. On this hundred year time-scale, ice-dynamics on the
Greenland ice sheet was found to counteract the mass-balance-
only effect by between 10 and 20%. Changes in both the area-
elevation distribution and iceberg discharge played a role,
although the physics controlling the latter are poorly known and
therefore not well represented in the models. Because of its
longer response time-scales, the Antarctic ice sheet hardly
exhibits any dynamic response on a century time-scale, except
when melting rates below the ice shelves were prescribed to rise
by in excess of | m/yr (O’ Farrell et al., 1997; Warner and Budd,

Local sea level changes can depart significantly from this
average signal because of the isostatic effects. Figure 11.5
illustrates typical observational results for sea level change since
the LGM in regions with no significant land movements other than
of a glacio-hydro-isostatic nature. Also shown are model predic-
tions for these localities, illustrating the importance of the isostatic
effects. Geophysical models of these isostatic effects are well
developed (see reviews by Lambeck and Johnston, 1998; Peltier,

high-resolution models of the spatial variability of the change
including the detailed description of ice loads and of the melt-water
load distribution (Mitrovica and Peltier, 1991; Johnston, 1993) and
the examination of different assumptions about the physics of the

"Information about the changes in ice sheets come from field
observations, glaciological modelling, and from the sea level
observations themselves. Much of the emphasis of recent work on
glacial rebound has focused on improved calculations of ice sheet
parameters from sea level data (Peltier, 1998; Johnston and
Lambeck, 2000; see also Section 11.3.1) but discrepancies
between glaciologically-based ice sheet models and models
inferred from rebound data remain, particularly for the time of,
and before, the LGM. The majority of ice at this time was
contained in the ice sheets of Laurentia and Fennoscandia but their
combined estimated volume inferred from the rebound data for
these regions (e.g., Nakada and Lambeck, 1988; Tushingham and
Peltier, 1991, 1992; Lambeck er al., 1998) is less than the total
volume required to explain the sea level change of about 120 to
125 m recorded at low latitude sites (Fairbanks, 1989; Yokoyama
et al., 2000). It is currently uncertain how the remainder of the ice
was distributed. For instance, estimates of the contribution of
Antarctic ice to sea level rise since the time of the LGM range
from as much as 37 m (Nakada and Lambeck, 1988) to 6 to 13 m
(Bentley, 1999; Huybrechts and Le Meur, 1999). Rebound
evidence from the coast of Antarctica indicates that ice volumes
have changed substantially since the LGM (Zwartz et al., 1997;
Bentley, 1999) but these observations, mostly extending back only
to 8,000 years ago, do not provide good constraints on the LGM
volumes. New evidence from exposure age dating of moraines and
rock surfaces is beginning to provide new constraints on ice
thickness in Antarctica (e.g., Stone et al., 1998) but the evidence is
not yet sufficient to constrain past volumes of the entire ice sheet.

Changes in the Earth’s ice sheets introduce a time-dependency
in the Earth’s inertia tensor whose consequences are observed
both in the planet’s rotation (as an acceleration in its rotation
rate and as a shift in the position of the rotation axis) and in the
acceleration of the rotation of satellite orbits about the Earth
(Wu and Peltier, 1984; Lambeck, 1988). Model estimates of
these changes are functions of mass shifts within and on the

tion changes sign (right-hand side). This result is typical for locations
near former ice margins or from near the centres of small ice sheets.
(c) The south of England where the isostatic contributions from the

but opposite sign. The dominant contribution to sea level change is
now the eustatic contribution. This behaviour is characteristic of
localities that lie well beyond the ice margins where a peripheral
bulge created by the ice load is subsiding as mantle material flows
towards the region formerly beneath the ice. (d) A location in
Australia where the melt-water load is the dominant cause of
isostatic adjustment. Here sea level has been falling for the past
6,000 years. This result is characteristic of continental margin sites
far from the former areas of glaciation. (From Lambeck, 1996.)

example, 0.5 mm/yr to the global sea level rise, then the rotational
constraints would require that most of this melting derived from
Greenland. Johnston and Lambeck (1999) concluded that a
solution consistent with geological evidence, including constraints
on sea level for the past 6,000 years (Section 11.3.1), is for a non-
steric sea level rise (i.e., not resulting from ocean density changes)
of 1.0 + 0.5 mm/yr for the past 100 years, with 5 to 30%

Gornitz et al. (1997) estimate that evapotranspiration of
water from irrigated land leads to an increase in atmospheric
water content and hence a fall in sea level of 0.14 to 0.15
mm/yr. We consider this to be an overestimate, because it
implies a 20th century increase in global tropospheric water
content which substantially exceeds observations (Section
2.5.3.2). They further suggest that irrigation water derived from
surface sources may infiltrate into aquifers, removing 0.40 to
0.48 mm/yr of sea level equivalent, based on the same assump-
tion as for seepage from reservoirs. Urbanisation leads to
reduced infiltration and increased surface runoff, which Gornitz
et al. (1997) estimate may contribute 0.35 to 0.41 mm/yr of sea
level rise. We consider these two terms to be upper bounds
because, as with infiltration from reservoirs, a new steady state
will be achieved after a period of years, with no further change
in storage.

Volumes of many of the world’s large lakes have been
reduced in recent decades through increased irrigation and other
water use. Sahagian et al. (1994) and Sahagian (2000) estimate
that the reduced volumes of the Caspian and Aral Seas (and
associated ground water) contribute 0.03 and 0.18 mm/year to
sea level rise, on the assumption that the extracted water reaches
the world ocean by evapotranspiration. Recent in situ records and
satellite altimetry data indicate that substantial fluctuations in the
level of the Caspian Sea can occur on decadal time-scales
(Cazenave et al., 1997) which suggests that short records may not
give a good indication of the long-term average. The reduction of
lake volumes in China may contribute a further 0.005 mm/yr (Shi
and Zhou, 1992). Assuming there are no other large sources, we
take 0.2 mm/yr as the upper limit of the present contribution to
sea level from lakes. Gornitz et al. (1997) do not include a term
from lake volume changes, because they assume the water
extracted for irrigation largely enters the ground water rather than
the world ocean, so we take zero as the lower limit.

"Gornitz et al. (1997) estimate there is 13.6 mm of sea level
equivalent impounded in reservoirs. Most of this capacity was
created, at roughly a constant rate, from 1950 to 1990. This rate
of storage represents a reduction in sea level of 0.34 mm/yr.
They assume that annually 5 + 0.5% of the water impounded
seeps into deep aquifers, giving a 1990 rate of seepage of 0.61
to 0.75 mm/yr, and a total volume of 15 mm sea level equiva-
lent. We consider that this represents an upper bound, because
it is likely that the rate of seepage from any reservoir will
decrease with time as the surrounding water table rises, as
assumed by Sahagian (2000). On the basis of a typical porosity
and area affected, he estimates that the volume trapped as
ground water surrounding reservoirs is 1.2 times the volume
impounded in reservoirs. His estimate of the storage in
reservoirs is 14 to 28 mm sea level equivalent; hence the ground
water storage is an additional 17 to 34 mm sea level equivalent.
Lack of global inventories means that these estimates of storage
may well be too small because of the many small reservoirs not
taken into account (rice paddies, ponds, etc., provided they
impound water above the water table) (V6résmarty and
Sahagian, 2000). The total stored could be up to 50% larger

"An important contribution to present day sea level rise could
result from changes in the amount of water stored in the ground,
on the surface in lakes and reservoirs, and by modifications to
surface characteristics affecting runoff or evapotranspiration
rates. Changing practices in the use of land and water could make
these terms larger in future. However, very little quantitative
information is available. For some of the components of the
terrestrial water budget, Gornitz ef al. (1997), updated by Gornitz
(2000), give net results which differ substantially from those of
Sahagian (2000) and V6résmarty and Sahagian (2000), and also
from those of Sahagian et al. (1994) used by Warrick et al.
(1996). The largest positive contribution to sea level probably
comes from ground water mining, which means the extraction of
ground water from storage in aquifers in excess of the rate of
natural recharge. Gornitz et al. (1997) estimate that ground water
is mined at a rate that has been increasing in time, currently
equivalent to 0.2 to 1.0 mm/yr of sea level, but they assume that
much of this infiltrates back into aquifers so the contribution to
sea level rise is only 0.1 to 0.4 mm/yr. Sahagian (2000) considers
fewer aquifers; consequently he obtains a smaller total of 0.17
mm/yr from mining, but assumes that all of this water eventually
reaches the ocean through the atmosphere or runoff. If Sahagian’s
assumption were applied to the inventory of Gornitz ef al. it
would imply a sea level contribution of 0.2 to 1.0 mm/yr.

Estimates of ice volume in northern hemisphere permafrost
range from 1.1 to 3.7x10'3 m3 (Zhang et al., 1999), equivalent
to 0.03 to 0.10 m of global-average sea level. It occupies 25%
of land area in the northern hemisphere. The major effects of
global warming in presently unglaciated cold regions will be
changes in the area of permafrost and a thickening of the active
layer (the layer of seasonally thawed ground above permafrost).
Both of these factors result in conversion of ground ice to liquid
water, and hence in principle could contribute to the sea level
change. Anisimov and Nelson (1997) estimated that a 10 to
20% reduction of area could occur by 2050 under a moderate
climate-change scenario. In the absence of information about
the vertical distribution of the ice, we make the assumption that
the volume change is proportional to the area change. By 2100,
the upper limit for the conversion of permafrost to soil water is
thus about 50% of the total, or 50 mm sea level equivalent.

"We define tectonic land movement as that part of the vertical
displacement of the crust that is of non-glacio-hydro-isostatic
origin. It includes rapid displacements associated with earthquake
events and also slow movements within (e.g., mantle convection)
and on (e.g., sediment transport) the Earth. Large parts of the earth
are subject to active tectonics which continue to shape the planet’s
surface. Where the tectonics occur in coastal areas, one of its
consequences is the changing relationship between the land and
sea surfaces as shorelines retreat or advance in response to the
vertical land movements. Examples include the Huon Peninsula
of Papua New Guinea (Chappell et al., 1996b), parts of the
Mediterranean (e.g. Pirazzoli et al., 1994; Antonioli and Oliverio,
1996), Japan (Ota et al., 1992) and New Zealand (Ota er al.,
1995). The Huon Peninsula provides a particularly good example
(Figure 11.6) with 125,000 year old coral terraces at up to 400 m
above present sea level. The intermediate terraces illustrated in
Figure 11.6 formed at times when the tectonic uplift rates and sea
level rise were about equal. Detailed analyses of these reef
sequences have indicated that long-term average uplift rates vary
between about 2 and 4 mm/yr, but that large episodic (and
unpredictable) displacements of 1 m or more occur at repeat times
of about 1,000 years (Chappell et al., 1996b). Comparable
average rates and episodic displacements have been inferred from
Greek shoreline evidence (Stiros et al., 1994). With major tectonic
activity occurring at the plate boundaries, which in many instances
are also continental or island margins, many of the world’s tide
gauge records are likely to contain both tectonic and eustatic
signals. One value of the geological data is that it permits evalua-
tions to be made of tectonic stability of the tide gauge locality.

dynamic processes lead to changes in the shape and volume of

Coastal subsidence in river delta regions can be an
important contributing factor to sea level change, with a typical
magnitude of 10 mm/yr, although the phenomenon will usually
be of a local character. Regions of documented subsidence
include the Mediterranean deltas (Stanley, 1997), the
Mississippi delta (Day et al., 1993) and the Asian deltas. In the
South China Sea, for example, the LGM shoreline is reported to
occur at a depth of about 165 m below present level (Wang ert
al., 1990), suggesting that some 40 m of subsidence may have
occurred in 20,000 years at an average rate of about 2 mm/yr.
Changes in relative sea level also arise through accretion and
erosion along the coast; again, such effects may be locally
significant.

In these analyses of Late Holocene observations, the relative
sea level change is attributed to both a contribution from any
change in ocean volume and a contribution from the glacio-hydro-
isostatic effect, where the former is a function of time only and the
latter is a function of both time and position. It is possible to use
the record of sea level changes to estimate parameters for a model
of isostatic rebound. In doing this, the spatial variability of sea
level change determines the mantle rheology, whereas the time
dependence determines any correction that may be required to the
assumed history of volume change. Solutions from different
geographic regions may lead to variations in the rheology due to
lateral variations in mantle temperature, for example, but the
eustatic term should be the same, within observational and model
uncertainties, in each case (Nakada and Lambeck, 1988). If it is
assumed that no eustatic change has occurred in the past 6,000

"Through the inverse barometer effect, a local increase in surface
air pressure over the ocean produces a depression in the sea
surface of 1 cm per hPa (1 hPa = | mbar). Since water is practi-

level rise, but a long-term trend in surface air pressure patterns
could influence observed local sea level trends. This has been
investigated using two data sets: (i) monthly mean values of

"The geological evidence for the past 10,000 to 20,000 years
indicates that major temporal and spatial variation occurs in
relative sea level change (e.g., Pirazzoli, 1991) on time-scales of
the order of a few thousand years (Figure 11.5). The change
observed at locations near the former centres of glaciation is
primarily the result of the glacio-isostatic effect, whereas the
change observed at tectonically stable localities far from the
former ice sheets approximate the global average sea level change
(for geologically recent times this is primarily eustatic change
relating to changes in land-based ice volume). Glacio-hydro-
isostatic effects (the Earth’s response to the past changes in ice and
water loads) remain important and result in a spatial variability in
sea level over the past 6,000 years for localities far from the former
ice margins. Analysis of data from such sites indicate that the
ocean volume may have increased to add 2.5 to 3.5 m to global
average sea level over the past 6,000 years (e.g., Fleming et al.,
1998), with a decreasing contribution in the last few thousand
years. If this occurred uniformly over the past 6,000 years it would
raise sea level by 0.4 to 0.6 mm/year. However, a few high resolu-
tion sea level records from the French Mediterranean coast
indicate that much of this increase occurred between about 6,000
and 3,000 years ago and that the rate over the past 3,000 years was
only about 0.1 to 0.2 mm/yr (Lambeck and Bard, 2000). These
inferences do not constrain the source of the added water but likely
sources are the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets with possible
contributions from glaciers and thermal expansion.

indicate that for the past 3,000 to 5,000 years oscillations in
global sea level on time-scales of 100 to 1,000 years are
unlikely to have exceeded 0.3 to 0.5 m. Archaeological
evidence for this interval places similar constraints on sea level
oscillations (Flemming and Webb, 1986). Some detailed local
studies have indicated that fluctuations of the order of 1 m can
occur (e.g., Van de Plassche ef al., 1998) but no globally
consistent pattern has yet emerged, suggesting that these may
be local rather than global variations.

The geological indicators of past sea level are usually not
sufficiently precise to enable fluctuations of sub-metre
amplitude to be observed. In some circumstances high quality
records do exist. These are from tectonically stable areas where
the tidal range is small and has remained little changed through
time, where no barriers or other shoreline features formed to
change the local conditions, and where there are biological
indicators that bear a precise and consistent relationship to sea
level. Such areas include the micro-atoll coral formations of
Queensland, Australia (Chappell, 1982; Woodroffe and

solution for Earth-model parameters will require a somewhat

The two solutions may, however, be equally satisfactory for
interpolating between observations. For example, both approaches
lead to mid-Holocene highstands at island and continental margin
sites far from the former ice sheets of amplitudes | to 3 m. The
occurrence of such sea level maxima places a upper limit on the
magnitude of glacial melt in recent millennia (e.g., Peltier, 2000),
but it would be inconsistent to combine estimates of ongoing
glacial melt with results of calculations of isostatic rebound in
which the rheological parameters have been inferred assuming
there is no ongoing melt.

Estimates of current ice sheet mass balance (Section
11.2.3.1) have improved since the SAR. However, these results
indicate only that the ice sheets are not far from balance. Earth
rotational constraints (Section 11.2.4.2) and ice sheet altimetry
(Section 11.2.3.2) offer the prospect of resolving the ice sheet
mass balance in the future, but at present the most accurate
estimates of the long-term imbalance (period of several
hundred years) follows from the comparison of the geological
sea level data with the ice sheet modelling results (Section
11.2.3.3). The above geological estimates of the recent sea
level rates may include a component from thermal expansion
and glacier mass changes which, from the long-term tempera-

sea level lowering by as much as 0.1 mm/yr. These results

Also, in adding recent mass into the oceans, most studies
have assumed that it is distributed uniformly and have
neglected the Earth’s elastic and gravitational response to the
changed water loading (analogous to glacio-hydro-isostatic
effect). This will have the effect of reducing the observed rise
at continental margin sites from ongoing mass contributions by
as much as 30% (cf. Nakiboglu and Lambeck, 1991).

A further underestimate of the rate of sea level rise from the
geological approach, compared to that from glacial rebound
models, will pertain in forebulge areas, and especially the North
American east coast, where the linear extrapolation of geological
data could result in an underestimate of the corrected rate of sea
level change for the past century typically by 0.3 mm/yr because
the glacial rebound signal is diminishing with time (Peltier,
2000). However, in areas remote from the former ice sheets this

bias will be considerably smaller.

The sea level records contain significant interannual and
decadal variability and long records are required in order to
estimate reliable secular rates that will be representative of the
last century. In addition, sea level change is spatially variable
because of land movements and of changes in the ocean circula-
tion. Therefore, a good geographic distribution of observations is
required. Neither requirement is satisfied with the current tide
gauge network and different strategies have been developed to
take these differences into consideration. Warrick et al. (1996),
Douglas (1995) and Smith et al. (2000) give recent reviews of the
subject, including discussions of the Northern Hemisphere
geographical bias in the historical data set.

In the absence of independent measurements of vertical
land movements by advanced geodetic techniques (Section
11.6.1), corrections for movements are based on either geolog-
ical data or geophysical modelling. The former method uses
geological evidence from locations adjacent to the gauges to
estimate the long-term relative sea level change which is
assumed to be caused primarily by land movements, from
whatever cause. This is subtracted from the gauge records to
estimate the eustatic change for the past century. However, this
procedure may underestimate the real current eustatic change
because the observed geological data may themselves contain a
long-term component of eustatic sea level rise (Section 11.3.1).
The latter method, glacial rebound modelling, is also
constrained by geological observations to estimate earth
response functions or ice load parameters, which may therefore
themselves contain a component of long-term eustatic sea level

"The primary source of information on secular trends in global
sea level during the past century is the tide gauge data set of the
Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) (Spencer and
Woodworth, 1993). The tide gauge measurement is of the level
of the sea surface relative to that of the land upon which the
gauge is located and contains information on both the displace-
ment of the land and on changes in ocean volume (eustatic
changes). The land displacement may be of two types: that
caused by active tectonics and that caused by glacial rebound.
Corrections for these effects are required if the change in ocean
volume is to be extracted from the tide gauge record. Both
corrections are imperfectly known and are based on sea level
observations themselves, usually from long geological records.
Different strategies have been developed for dealing with these
corrections but differences remain that are not inconsequential
(see Table 11.9).

"There have been several more studies since the SAR of
trends observed in particular regions. Woodworth et al. (1999)
provided a partial update to Shennan and Woodworth (1992),
suggesting that sea level change in the North Sea region has been
about | mm/yr during the past century. Lambeck et al. (1998)
combined coastal tide gauge data from Fennoscandinavia
together with lake level records and postglacial rebound models
to estimate an average regional rise for the past century of 1.1 +
0.2 mm/yr. Studies of the North American east coast have been
particularly concerned with the spatial dependence of trends
associated with the Laurentian forebulge. Peltier (1996)
concluded a current rate of order 1.9 + 0.6 mn1/yr, larger than the
1.5 mm/yr obtained by Gornitz (1995), who used the geological
data approach, and Mitrovica and Davis (1995), who employed
Post Glacial Rebound (PGR) modelling. Note that the observa-
tions of thermal expansion (Section 11.2.1.1) indicate a higher
rate of sea level rise over recent decades in the sub-tropical gyres
of the North Atlantic (i.e., off the North American east coast) than
the higher latitude sub-polar gyre. Thus the differences between
three lower European values compared with the higher North
American values may reflect a real regional difference (with
spatial variations in regional sea level change being perhaps
several tenths of a millimetre per year — see also Section 11.5.2).
In China, relative sea level is rising at about 2 mm/yr in the south
but less than 0.5 mm/yr in the north (National Bureau of Marine
Management, 1992), with an estimated average of the whole
coastline of 1.6 mm/yr (Zhen and Wu, 1993) and with attempts to
remove the spatially dependent component of vertical land
movement yielding an average of 2.0 mm/yr (Shi, 1996). The two
longest records from Australia (both in excess of 80 years in

Fremantle, on opposite sides of the continent. They show

There have been only two analyses. ‘of global sea level
change based on the PSMSL data set published since the SAR.
Douglas (1997) provided an update to Douglas (1991) and
applied the PGR model of Tushingham and Peltier (1991) to a
selected set of twenty-four long tide gauge records, grouped
into nine geographical areas, with minimum record length 60
years and average length 83 years. However, the only Southern
Hemisphere sites included in this solution were from Argentina
and New Zealand. The overall global average of 1.8 + 0.1
mm/yr agreed with the 1991 analysis, with considerable consis-
tency between area-average trends. The standard error of the
global rate was derived from the standard deviation of regional
trends, assuming that temporal and spatial variability is
uncorrelated between regions. Peltier and Jiang (1997) used
essentially the same set of stations as Douglas and a new model
for postglacial rebound.

"From Table 11.9 one can see that there are six global estimates

mm/yr (Peltier and Tushingham, 1989, 1991). We consider that
these five are consistent within the systematic uncertainty of the
PGR models, which may have a range of uncertainty of 0.5 mm/yr
depending on earth structure parametrization employed (Mitrovica

be underestimated by up to a few tenths of a millimetre per year,
although such considerations do not affect the method of

There is no evidence for any acceleration of sea level rise in
data from the 20th century data alone (Woodworth, 1990;
Gornitz and Solow, 1991; Douglas, 1992). Mediterranean
records show decelerations, and even decreases in sea level in
the latter part of the 20th century, which may be caused by
increases in the density of Mediterranean Deep Water and air
pressure changes connected to the North Atlantic Oscillation
(NAO) (Tsimplis and Baker, 2000), suggesting the
Mediterranean might not be the best area for monitoring secular
trends. Models of ocean thermal expansion indicate an accelera-
tion through the 20th century but when the model is subsampled
at the locations of the tide gauges no significant acceleration can
be detected because of the greater level of variability (Gregory
et al., 2001). Thus the absence of an acceleration in the observa-

Careful comparison of TOPEX/POSEIDON data with tide
gauge data reveals a difference in the rate of change of local sea
level of —2.3 + 1.2 mm/yr (Mitchum, 1998) or —2 + 1.5 mm/yr
(Cazenave et al., 1999). This discrepancy is caused by a combina-
tion of instrumental drift, especially in the TOPEX Microwave
Radiometer (TMR) (Haines and Bar-Sever, 1998), and vertical
land motions which have not been allowed for in the tide gauge
data. The most recent estimates of global average sea level rise
from the six years of TOPEX/POSEIDON data (using corrections
from tide gauge comparisons) are 2.1 + 1.2 mm/yr (Nerem et al.,
1997), 1.4 + 0.2 mm/yr (Cazenave et al., 1998; Figure 11.8), 3.1
+ 1.3 mm/yr (Nerem, 1999) and 2.5 + 1.3 mm/yr (Nerem, 1999),

uted to the TMR. When Cazenave et al. allow for the TMR drift,

"Comparison of the rate of sea level rise over the last 100 years
(1.0 to 2.0 mm/yr) with the geological rate over the last two
millennia (0.1 to 0.2 mm/yr; Section 11.3.1) implies a compara-
tively recent acceleration in the rate of sea level rise. The few
very long tide gauge records are especially important in the
search for “accelerations” in sea level rise. Using four of the
longest (about two centuries) records from north-west Europe
(Amsterdam, Brest, Sheerness, Stockholm), Woodworth (1990)
found long-term accelerations of 0.4 to 0.9 mm/yr/century
(Figure 11.7). Woodworth (1999a) found an acceleration of
order 0.3 mm/yr/century in the very long quasi-mean sea level
(or ‘Adjusted Mean High Water’) record from Liverpool. From
these records, one can infer that the onset of the acceleration
occurred during the 19th century, a suggestion consistent with
separate analysis of the long Stockholm record (Ekman, 1988,
1999; see also Mérner, 1973). It is also consistent with some
geological evidence from north-west Europe (e.g., Allen and
Rae, 1988). In North America, the longest records are from Key
West, Florida, which commenced in 1846 and which suggest an
acceleration of order 0.4 mm/year/century (Maul and Martin,
1993), and from New York which commenced in 1856 and
which has a similar acceleration. Coastal evolution evidence
from parts of eastern North America suggest an increased rate of
rise between one and two centuries before the 20th century

1996; Van de Plassche ef al., 1998; Varekamp and Thomas,

temperature, perhaps indicating the importance of steric effects
through ocean heat storage. Cazenave et al. (1998) and Nerem et

fall in global averaged sea level of about 20 mm (Figure 11.8).
These findings indicate that the major 1997/98 El Nifio-Southern

The reason for the remaining discrepancy is not clear.
However, the largest uncertainty (by a factor of more than two)
is in the terrestrial storage terms. Several of the components of
the terrestrial storage term are poorly determined and the
quoted limits require several of the contributions simultane-
ously to lie at the extremes of their ranges. This coincidence is
improbable unless the systematic errors affecting the estimates
are correlated. Furthermore, while coupled models have
improved considerably in recent years, and there is general
agreement between the observed and modelled thermal
expansion contribution, the models’ ability to quantitatively
simulate decadal changes in ocean temperatures and thus
thermal expansion has not been adequately tested. Given the
poor global coverage of high quality tide gauge records and the
uncertainty in the corrections for land motions, the observa-
tionally based rate of sea level rise this century should also be
questioned.

In the models, at least a third of 20th century anthropogenic
eustatic sea level rise is caused by thermal expansion, which has
a geographically non-uniform signal in sea level change.
AOGCMs do not agree in detail about the patterns of geograph-
ical variation (see Section 11.5.2). They all give a geographical
spread of 20th century trends at individual grid points which is
characterised by a standard deviation of 0.2 to 0.5 mm/yr
(Gregory et al., 2001). This spread is a result of a combination of
spatial non-uniformity of trends and the uncertainty in local trend
estimates arising from temporal variability. As yet no published
study has revealed a stable pattern of observed non-uniform sea
level change. Such a pattern would provide a critical test of
models. If there is significant non-uniformity, a trend from a
single location would be an inaccurate estimate of the global
average. For example, Douglas (1997) averaged nine regions and
found a standard deviation of about 0.3 mm/yr (quoted by
Douglas as a standard error), similar to the range expected from
AOGCMs.

Recent studies (see Sections 2.3.3, 2, 3.4) suggest that the
19th century was unusually cold on the global average, and that
an increase in solar output may have had a moderate influence on
warming in the early 20th century (Section 12.4.3.3). This
warming might have produced some thermal expansion and
could have been responsible for the onset of glacier recession in
the early 20th century (e.g., Dowdeswell et al., 1997), thus

the differences in the thermal expansion derive from differences in

factors: the size of the surface warming, the effectiveness of heat
uptake by the ocean for a given warming (Gregory and Mitchell,

(Russell et al., 2000). The separation of the first two factors
parallels the distinction made in Section 9.3.4.2 between the effects
of climate feedback and heat uptake on the rate of climate change.
Since models differ in regard to the second and third factors,

Increasing temperatures will increase the runoff and enlarge the
area experiencing ablation, but their contribution is very likely to

ECHAM4 model (Wild and Ohmura, 2000) for a doubling of
CO). To generate time-dependent boundary conditions, these
patterns were scaled with the area average changes over the ice
sheets as a function of time for each AOGCM experiment using
a method similar to that described by Huybrechts et al. (1999).

"For constant glacier area, from the AOGCM IS92a experi-
ments including sulphate aerosol, predicted sea level rise from
glacier melt over the hundred years 1990 to 2090 lies in the range
0.06 to 0.15 m. The variation is due to three factors. First, the
global average temperature change varies between models. A
larger temperature rise tends to give more melting, but they are
not linearly related, since the total melt depends on the time-
integrated temperature change. Second, the global mass balance
sensitivity to temperature change varies among AOGCMs
because of their different seasonal and regional distribution of
temperature change. Third, the glaciers are already adjusting to
climate change during the 20th century, and any such imbalance
will persist during the 21st century, in addition to the further
imbalance due to future climate change. The global average
temperature change and glacier mass balance sensitivity may not
be independent factors, since both are affected by regional
climate feedbacks. The sensitivity and the present imbalance are
related factors, because a larger sensitivity implies a greater
present imbalance.

changes in temperature and precipitation, as noted by Kapsner et

Greenland ice cores. The range of AOGCM thermodynamic and

Given that all AOGCMs agree on an increase, but differ on the
strength of the relationship, we include an uncertainty of +0.02
mm/yr/°C in Table 11.13 on the Greenland local sensitivities,
being the product of the standard deviation of precipitation

Mass balance sensitivities are derived by regressing rate of
change of mass against global or local temperature change (note
that they include the effect of precipitation changes) (Table
11.13). The Greenland local sensitivities are smaller than some of
the values reported previously from other methods (Section
11.2.3.4 and Table 11.7) and by Warrick et al. (1996) because of
the larger precipitation increases and the seasonality of tempera-
ture changes (less increase in summer) predicted by AOGCMs,
and the smaller temperature rise in the ablation zone (as
compared to the ice-sheet average) projected by the T106
ECHAM4 time slice results. The Antarctic sensitivities are less
negative than those in Table 11.7 because the AOGCMs predict
smaller precipitation increases.

Estimates of Greenland runoff (Table 11.5) have a standard
error of about + 10%. This reflects uncertainty in the degree-day
method (Braithwaite, 1995) and refreezing parametrization
(Janssens and Huybrechts, 2000) used to calculate Greenland
ablation. Given that a typical size of the sensitivity of ablation to
temperature change is 0.3 mm/yr/°C (Table 11.7), we adopt an
additional uncertainty of + 0.03 mm/yr/°C for the local
Greenland sensitivities in Table 11.13. We include a separate
uncertainty of the same size to reflect the possible sensitivity to
use of different high-resolution geographical patterns of temper-
ature and precipitation change (the T106 ECHAM4 pattern was
the only one available). As an estimate of the uncertainty related
to changes in iceberg discharge and area-elevation distribution,
we ascribe an uncertainty of + 10% to the net mass change, on
the basis of the magnitude of the dynamic response for Greenland
described in Section 11.2.3.4.

sea level change from ocean processes in the 21st century are

than the global average (in many cases of more than twice the

"different for three reasons from the case of global average
temperature change (Section 9.3.2.1), where the scenario and
modelling uncertainties are comparable. First, the compensa-
tion between climate sensitivity and heat uptake does not apply
to thermal expansion. Second, models with large climate
sensitivity and temperature change consequently have a large
land-ice melt contribution to sea level. Third, both thermal
expansion and land-ice melt depend on past climate change,
being approximately proportional to the time-integral of
temperature change; the SRES scenarios differ by less in
respect of the time-integral of temperature change over the
interval 1990 to 2100 than they do in respect of the temperature
change at 2100.

The range we have given also does not take account of
uncertainty in modelling of radiative forcing, the carbon cycle,
atmospheric chemistry, or storage of water in the terrestrial
environment. The recent publications by Gornitz et al. (1997)
and Sahagian (2000) indicate that this last term could be signif-
icant (Section 11.2.5). Future changes in terrestrial storage
depend on societal decisions on the use of ground water, the
building of reservoirs and other factors. We are not currently in
a position to make projections incorporating future changes in
these factors, although we note that the assumptions behind the
construction of the SRES scenarios imply increasing water
consumption, which may entail both more ground water extrac-
tion and more reservoir capacity. Continued anthropogenic
water storage on land at its current rate could change the
projected sea level rise 1990 to 2100 by between -0.21 and
+0.11 m. We emphasise that estimates of the relevant factors are
highly uncertain (see Sections 11.2.5 and 11.4).

Seven of the nine models in Table 11.14 (also Bryan, 1996;
Russell et al., 2000) exhibit a maximum sea level rise in the Arctic
Ocean. A possible reason for this is a freshening of the Arctic due
to increased river runoff or precipitation over the ocean (Bryan,
1996; Miller and Russell, 2000). The fall in salinity leads to a
reduction of density, which requires a compensating sea level rise
in order to maintain the pressure gradient at depth.

Local land movements, both isostatic and tectonic (Sections
11.2.4.1, 11.2.6), will continue in the 21st century at rates which
are unaffected by climate change, and should be added to the
regional variation described in this section. On account of the
increased eustatic rate of rise in the 21st century (Section 11.5.1)
it can be expected that by 2100 many regions currently experi-

Seven of the models (also Gregory, 1993; Bryan, 1996) show
a minimum of sea level rise in the circumpolar Southern Ocean

Ocean is a region of pronounced heat uptake (e.g., Murphy and

changes in surface windstress, with consequences for changes in

The lack of similarity means that our confidence in predictions of
local sea level changes is low. However, we can identify a few

"Titus and Narayanan (1996) propose a simple method for
computing local projections of mean sea level rise given histor-
ical observations at a site and projections of global average sea
level (such as Figure 11.12). To allow for local land movements
and our current inability to model sea level change accurately
(Section 11.4), they propose linearly extrapolating the historical
record and adding to this a globally averaged projection.
However, they point out that to avoid double counting, it is
necessary to correct the global projection for the corresponding
modelled trend of sea level rise during the period of the histor-
ical observations. Caution is required in applying this method
directly to the projections of this chapter for several reasons.
First, current model projections indicate substantial spatial
variability in sea level rise. This variability has a standard
deviation of up to 0.1 m by 2100; some locations experience a
sea level rise of more than twice the global-average thermal
expansion, while others may have a fall in sea level (Section
11.5.2; Table 11.15). Second, there are uncertainties in the
accuracy of the trend from the historical record and in modelling
of past sea level changes (Sections 11.3.2.1 and 11.4). Third, as
well as changes in mean sea level there may be changes in the
local meteorological regime resulting in modified storm surge
statistics (Section 11.5.3.2). If the method of Titus and
Narayanan is not applied, it is nonetheless important to
recognise that in all models and scenarios the rate of local sea
level rise in the 21st century is projected to be greater than in the
20th century at the great majority of coastal locations.

The probability of flood risk in coastal areas is generally

butions are usually computed from observed annual maximum
sea levels from several decades of tide gauge data, or from
numerical models. While such distributions are readily available
for many locations, a worldwide set has never been computed to

Changes in the highest sea levels at a given locality could
result mainly from two effects. First, if mean sea level rises, the
present extreme levels will be attained more frequently, all else
being equal. This may imply a significant increase in the area
threatened with inundation (e.g., Hubbert and McInnes, 1999)
and an increased risk within the existing flood plain. The effect
can be estimated from a knowledge of the present day
frequency of occurrence of extreme levels (e.g., Flather and
Khandker, 1993; Lowe er al., 2001; Figure 11.14).

Second, changes in storm surge heights would result from
alterations to the occurrence of strong winds and low
pressures. At low-latitude locations, such as the Bay of Bengal,
northern Australia and the southern USA, tropical cyclones are
the primary cause of storm surges. Changes in frequency and
intensity of tropical cyclones could result from alterations to
sea surface temperature, large-scale atmospheric circulation
and the characteristics of ENSO (Pittock et al., 1996) but no
consensus has yet emerged (see Box 10.2). In other places,
such as southern Australia and north-west Europe, storm
surges are associated with mid-latitude low-pressure systems.
For instance, Hubbert and McInnes (1999) showed that
increasing the wind speeds in historical storm surge events
associated with the passage of cold fronts could lead to greater
flooding in Port Phillip Bay, Victoria, Australia. Changes in
extratropical storms also cannot be predicted with confidence
(Section 9.3.6.3).

The long time-scale (of the order of 1,000 years) on which
thermal expansion approaches its eventual level is characteristic
of the weak diffusion and slow circulation processes that
transport heat to the deep ocean. On account of the time-scale,
the thermal expansion in the 2xCO, experiments after 500 years
of constant CO, is 4 to 9 times greater than at the time when the
concentration stabilises. Even by this time, it may only have
reached half of its eventual level, which models suggest may lie
within a range of 0.5 to 2.0 m for 2xCO) and | to 4 m for 4xCO).
For the first 1,000 years, the 4xCO, models give 1 to 3 m.

continue to react to the imposed climatic change during the next
millennium, even if the warming stabilised early in the 22nd

Melting of all existing glaciers and ice caps would raise sea level

loss from land-ice outside Greenland and Antarctica is 0.05 to
0.11 m (Table 11.12). Further contraction of glacier area and
retreat to high altitude will restrict ablation, so we cannot use the
21st century rates to deduce that there is a time by which all
glacier mass will have disappeared. However, the loss of a
substantial fraction of the total glacier mass is likely. The
viability of any particular glacier or ice cap will depend on
whether there remains any part of it, at high altitude, where
ablation does not exceed accumulation over the annual cycle.
Areas which are currently marginally glaciated are most likely to
become ice-free.

"The Greenland ice sheet is the most vulnerable to climatic
warming. As the temperature rises, ablation will increase. For
moderate warming, the ice sheet can be retained with reduced
extent and modified shape if this results in less ablation and/or a
decrease in the rate of ice discharge into the sea, each of which
currently account for about half the accumulation (Section
11.2.3). The discharge can be reduced by thinning of the ice sheet
near the grounding line. Ablation can be reduced by a change in
the area-elevation distribution. However, once ablation has
increased enough to equal accumulation, the ice sheet cannot
survive, since discharge cannot be less than zero. This situation
occurs for an annual-average warming of 2.7°C for the present
ice-sheet topography, and for a slightly larger warming for a
retreating ice sheet (Huybrechts et al., 1991; see also Oerlemans,

the warming penetrates more deeply (Figure 11.15, Table 11.16;

The discharge of the WAIS is dominated by fast-flowing ice
streams, dynamically constrained at four boundaries: the transi-
tion zone where grounded ice joins the floating ice shelf (Van der
Veen, 1985; Herterich, 1987), the interface of ice with bedrock
that is lubricated by sediment and water (Blankenship ef al.,
1986; Anandakrishnan et al., 1998; Bell et al., 1998), the shear
zone where fast-moving ice meets relatively static ice at the
transverse margins of ice streams (Echelmeyer et al., 1994;
Jacobson and Raymond, 1998), and the ice-stream onset regions
where slowly flowing inland ice accelerates into the ice streams.
Mechanisms have been proposed for dynamic changes at each of
these boundaries.

Nonetheless, there is a considerable body of evidence for ice
stream variability, and the above analyses may not apply to
dynamic situations involving large thinning or grounding line
change. Ice Stream C largely stopped about a century ago
(Retzlaff and Bentley, 1993) and Ice Stream B decelerated by
20% within a decade (Stephenson and Bindschadler, 1988). The
mechanisms for these oscillations are not well understood and
have been ascribed to processes such as basal water diversion to
a neighbouring ice stream (Anandakrishnan and Alley, 1997) or
thermomechanical interactions between competing catchment
areas (Payne, 1998). Despite ice stream variability in the latter
model on the millenial time-scale, the overall volume of the
WAIS hardly changed, supporting the suggestion that ice streams
may act to remove the imbalance of individual drainage basins

and to stabilise rather than destabilise WAIS (Hindmarsh, 1993).

Huybrechts and De Wolde (1999) (Figure 11.16) (see also
Letreguilly et al., 1991) find the Greenland ice sheet contributes
about 3 m of sea level rise equivalent over a thousand years under
their mid-range scenario, in which the Greenland temperature
change passes through 4°C in 2100 before stabilising at 5.5°C
after 2130. Taking into account the high-latitude amplification of
warming, this temperature change is consistent with mid-range
stabilisation scenarios (Chapter 9, Section 9.3.3.1 and Figure
9.17(b)). For a warming of 8°C, they calculate a contribution of
about 6 m. Their experiments take into account the effect of
concomitant increases in precipitation (which reduces sensitivity)
but also of the precipitation fraction falling as rain (which
strongly enhances sensitivity for the larger temperature
increases). Disregarding the effects of accumulation changes and
rainfall, Greve (2000) reports that loss of mass would occur at a
rate giving a sea level rise of between | mm/yr for a year-round
temperature perturbation of 3°C to as much as 7 mm/yr for a
sustained warming of 12°C, the latter being an extreme scenario
in which the ice sheet would be largely eliminated within 1,000
years.

The WAIS was much larger during the LGM and has
probably lost up to two thirds of its volume since then
(Bindschadler, 1998). The largest losses have been from
grounding line retreat below the present WAIS ice shelves (Ross
and Filchner-Ronne), most likely as a gradual response to rising
sea levels subsequent to melting of the Northern Hemisphere ice
sheets (Ingolfsson et al., 1998). Local imbalances, both positive
and negative, are presently occurring (Shabtaie and Bentley,
1987; Whillans and Bindschadler, 1988; Bindschadler and
Vornberger, 1998; Hamilton ef al., 1998; Rignot, 1998a,b;
Wingham, et al., 1998), but there is no conclusive observational
evidence (from monitoring of surface elevation, see Section
11.2.3.2) that WAIS overall is making a significant contribution
to global average sea level change (Bentley, 1997, 1998a,b;
Bindschadler, 1998; Oppenheimer, 1998; Wingham ef al. 1998).
Conway et al. (1999) suggest that grounding line retreat since the
LGM may still be ongoing, giving an average rate of recession
corresponding to a rate of sea level rise of 0.9 mm/yr
(Bindschadler, 1998). If projected into the future, this would
imply disappearance of WAIS in 4,000 to 7,000 years
(Bindschadler, 1998). However, geological estimates of ocean
volume increase over the last 6,000 years place an upper limit of
about half this amount on global sea level rise (Section 11.3.1).

Based on a wide-ranging review, Oppenheimer (1998)
argues that WAIS could disintegrate within five to seven centuries
following a warming of only a few degrees. Such a collapse
implies a rate of sea level rise of 10 mm/yr and an average speed-
up of the total outflow by at least a factor of 10 (Bentley, 1997,
1998a,b). However, the majority opinion of a recent expert panel
reported by Vaughan and Spouge (2001) is that such outflow
"	Text
"rates are not attainable. It is, therefore, also plausible that WAIS
may not make a significant contribution to sea level rise over
time-scales less than a millennium. Vaughan and Spouge (2001)
attribute a 50% probability to the latter scenario, but retained an
equally large probability that the sea level rise will be larger than
2 mm/yr after 1,000 years, emphasising the inadequacy of our
current understanding of the dynamics of WAIS, especially for
predictions on the longer time-scales.

"Thresholds for disintegration of the East Antarctic ice sheet by
surface melting involve warmings above 20°C, a situation that
has not occurred for at least the last 15 million years (Barker et
al., 1999), and which is far more than thought possible under any
scenario of climatic change currently under consideration. In that
case, the ice sheet would decay over a period of at least 10,000
years. However, the recent inference of complex flow patterns in
the interior of the East Antarctic ice sheet demonstrates the
existence of ice-streaming features penetrating far inland, which
may be indicative of a more dynamic regime than believed so far
(Bamber et al., 2000; Huybrechts et al., 2000).
"	Text
" 

In view of these considerations, it is now widely agreed that
major loss of grounded ice, and accelerated sea level rise, is very
unlikely during the 21st century. An interdisciplinary panel of
international experts applying the techniques of risk assessment
to the future evolution of WAIS concluded that there is a 98%
chance that WAIS will not collapse in the next 100 years, defined
as a change that contributes at least 10 mm/yr to global sea level
change (Vaughan and Spouge, 2001). The probability of a contri-
bution to sea level (exceeding 0.5 m) by the year 2100 was 5%.
These results are broadly consistent with an earlier assessment by
Titus and Narayanan (1996) based on a US-only panel, who
found a 5% chance of a 0.16 m contribution and 1% chance of a
0.3 m contribution to sea level rise from WAIS by 2100. We note
that Vaughan and Spouge also report a probability of 5% for
WAIS giving a sea level fall exceeding 0.4 m within the same
time frame, while Titus and Narayanan give 0.18 m.

Independent of bottom melting below the ice shelves and the
possibility of an ice-dynamic instability, surface melting sets an
upper temperature limit on the viability of the Antarctic ice sheet,
because runoff would eventually become the dominant wastage
mechanism (as would be the case for Greenland in a climate
several degrees warmer than today). For warmings of more than
10°C, simple runoff models predict that an ablation zone would
develop around the Antarctic coast, making the mass balance at
sea level sufficiently negative that the grounded ice would no
longer be able to feed an ice shelf. Also the WAIS ice shelves
would disintegrate to near to their inland limits as summer
temperatures rise above the thermal limit of ice shelf viability
believed to be responsible for the recent collapse of ice shelves at
the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. Disintegration of
WAIS would in that case result, because the WAIS cannot retreat
to higher ground once its margins are subjected to surface
melting and begin to recede (Huybrechts, 1994). Depending on
the strength of the warming, such a disintegration would take at
least a few millennia.
"	Text
"Nonetheless, on a longer time-scale, changes in ice dynamics
could result in significantly increased outflow of ice into the ice
shelves and a grounding line retreat. Large-scale models show
both of these phenomena to be sensitive to basal melting below the
ice shelves (Warner and Budd, 1998; Huybrechts and De Wolde,
1999). Model studies do not agree on the sensitivity of the basal
melting to an oceanic warming: for instance, one shows a quad-
tupling of the basal melting rate below the Amery ice shelf in East
Antarctica for an adjacent sea warming of 1°C (Williams et al.,
1998), while another claims that warmer sea temperatures would
reduce melting rates below the Ronne-Filchner ice shelves
through alteration to sea-ice formation and the thermohaline
circulation (Nicholls, 1997). Changes in open ocean circulation
may also play a role. Warner and Budd (1998) suggest that even
for moderate climatic warmings of a few degrees, a large increase
in bottom melting of 5 m/yr becomes the dominant factor in the
longer-term response of the Antarctic ice sheet. In their model, this
causes the demise of WAIS ice shelves in a few hundred years and
would float a large part of the WAIS (and marine portions of East
Antarctica) after 1,000 years. Predicted rates of sea level rise are
between 1.5 and 3.0 mm/yr depending on whether accumulation
rates increase together with the warming. Allowing for runoff in
addition to increased accumulation, Huybrechts and De Wolde
(1999) find a maximum Antarctic contribution to global sea level
rise of 2.5 mm/yr for an extreme scenario involving a warming of
8°C and a bottom melting rate of 10 m/yr. These figures are upper
limits based on results currently available from numerical models,
which do not resolve ice streams explicitly and which may not
adequately predict the effect of ice shelf thinning on grounding

line retreat owing to physical uncertainties.

Several studies since the SAR have included an explicit
representation of greenhouse gases (as opposed to an equivalent
increase in carbon dioxide (CO,)). Some have also included
tropospheric ozone changes, an interactive sulphur cycle, an
explicit radiative treatment of the scattering of sulphate
aerosols, and improved estimates of the changes in stratos-
pheric ozone. While detection of the climate response to these
other anthropogenic factors is often ambiguous, detection of the

"The IPCC WGI Second Assessment Report (IPCC, 1996)
(hereafter SAR) concluded, “the balance of evidence suggests
that there is a discernible human influence on global climate”. It
noted that the detection and attribution of anthropogenic climate
change signals can only be accomplished through a gradual
accumulation of evidence. The SAR authors also noted
uncertainties in a number of factors, including the magnitude and
patterns of internal climate variability, external forcing and
climate system response, which prevented them from drawing a
stronger conclusion. The results of the research carried out since
1995 on these uncertainties and other aspects of detection and
attribution are summarised below.

Since the SAR, more simulations with increases in greenhouse
gases and some representation of aerosol effects have become
available. In some cases, ensembles of simulations have been
run to reduce noise in the estimates of the time-dependent
response. Some studies have evaluated seasonal variation of
the response. Uncertainties in the estimated climate change
signals have made it difficult to attribute the observed climate
change to one specific combination of anthropogenic and
natural influences. Nevertheless, all studies since the SAR
have found a significant anthropogenic contribution is required
to account for surface and tropospheric trends over at least the
last 30 years.

"A longer and more closely scrutinised observational record
Three of the five years (1995, 1996 and 1998) added to the instru-
mental record since the SAR are the warmest in the instrumental
record of global temperatures, consistent with the expectation that
increases in greenhouse gases will lead to continued long-term
warming. The impact of observational sampling errors has been
estimated for the global and hemispheric mean surface temperature
record and found to be small relative to the warming observed over
the 20th century. Some sources of error and uncertainty in both the
Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) and radiosonde observations
have been identified that largely resolve discrepancies between the
two data sets. However, current climate models cannot fully
account for the observed difference in the trend between the
surface and lower-tropospheric temperatures over the last twenty
years even when all known external influences are included. New
reconstructions of the surface temperature record of the last 1,000
years indicate that the temperature changes over the last 100 years
are unlikely to be entirely natural in origin, even taking into
account the large uncertainties in palaeo-reconstructions.

"Since the SAR, more models have been used to estimate the
magnitude of internal climate variability. Several of the models
used for detection show similar or larger variability than observed
on interannual to decadal time-scales, even in the absence of
external forcing. The warming over the past 100 years is very
unlikely to be due to internal variability alone as estimated by
current models. Estimates of variability on the longer time-scales
relevant to detection and attribution studies are uncertain.
Nonetheless, conclusions on the detection of an anthropogenic
signal are insensitive to the model used to estimate internal
variability and recent changes cannot be accounted for as pure
internal variability even if the amplitude of simulated internal
variations is increased by a factor of two or more. In most recent
studies, the residual variability that remains in the observations
after removal of the estimated anthropogenic signals is consistent
with model-simulated variability on the space- and time-scales
used for detection and attribution. Note, however, that the power
of the consistency test is limited. Detection studies to date have
shown that the observed large-scale changes in surface tempera-
ture in recent decades are unlikely (bordering on very unlikely) to
be entirely the result of internal variability.

Fully coupled ocean-atmosphere models have used reconstruc-
tions of solar and volcanic forcings over the last one to three
centuries to estimate the contribution of natural forcing to
climate variability and change. Including their effects produces
an increase in variance on all time-scales and brings the low-
frequency variability simulated by models closer to that
deduced from palaeo-reconstructions. Assessments based on
physical principles and model simulations indicate that natural
forcing alone is unlikely to explain the increased rate of global
warming since the middle of the 20th century or changes in
vertical temperature structure. The reasons are that the trend in
natural forcing has likely been negative over the last two
decades and natural forcing alone is unlikely to account for the
observed cooling of the stratosphere. However, there is
evidence for a detectable volcanic influence on climate. The
available evidence also suggests a solar influence in proxy
records of the last few hundred years and also in the instru-
mental record of the early 20th century. Statistical assessments
confirm that natural variability (the combination of internal and
naturally forced) is unlikely to explain the warming in the latter
half of the 20th century.

A major advance since the SAR is the increase in the range
of techniques used, and the evaluation of the degree to which
the results are independent of the assumptions made in
applying those techniques. There have been studies using
pattern correlations, optimal detection studies using one or
more fixed patterns and time-varying patterns, and a number
of other techniques. Evidence of a human influence on
climate is obtained using all these techniques.

Results are sensitive to the range of temporal and spatial
scales that are considered. Several decades of data are
necessary to separate the forced response from internal
variability. Idealised studies have demonstrated that surface
temperature changes are detectable only on scales greater
than 5,000 km. Studies also show that the level of agreement
found between simulations and observations in pattern
correlation studies is close to what one would expect in
theory.

The increase in the number of studies, the breadth of
techniques, increased rigour in the assessment of the role of
anthropogenic forcing in climate, the robustness of results to
the assumptions made using those techniques, and consis-
tency of results lead to increased confidence in these results.
Moreover, to be consistent with the signal observed to date,
the rate of anthropogenic warming is likely to lie in the range
0.1 to 0.2°C/decade over the first half of the 21st century
under the IS92a (IPCC, 1992) emission scenario.

The SAR concluded: “The balance of evidence suggests a
discernible human influence on global climate”. That report also
noted that the anthropogenic signal was still emerging from the
background of natural climate variability. Since the SAR,
progress has been made in reducing uncertainty, particularly with
respect to distinguishing and quantifying the magnitude of
responses to different external influences. Although many of the
sources of uncertainty identified in the SAR still remain to some
degree, new evidence and improved understanding support an
updated conclusion.

Attribution studies have applied multi-signal techniques
to address whether or not the magnitude of the observed
response to a particular forcing agent is consistent with the
modelled response and separable from the influence of other
forcing agents. The inclusion of time-dependent signals has
helped to distinguish between natural and anthropogenic
forcing agents. As more response patterns are included, the
problem of degeneracy (different combinations of patterns
yielding near identical fits to the observations) inevitably
arises. Nevertheless, even with the responses to all the major
forcing factors included in the analysis, a distinct
greenhouse gas signal remains detectable. Overall, the
magnitude of the model-simulated temperature response to
greenhouse gases is found to be consistent with the observed
greenhouse response on the scales considered. However,
there remain discrepancies between the modelled and
observed responses to other natural and anthropogenic
factors, and estimates of signal amplitudes are model-
dependent. Most studies find that, over the last 50 years, the
estimated rate and magnitude of warming due to increasing
concentrations of greenhouse gases alone are comparable
with, or larger than, the observed warming. Furthermore,
most model estimates that take into account both greenhouse
gases and sulphate aerosols are consistent with observations
over this period.

"A number of important uncertainties remain. These include:

¢ Discrepancies between the vertical profile of temperature
change in the troposphere seen in observations and models.
These have been reduced as more realistic forcing histories
have been used in models, although not fully resolved. Also,
the difference between observed surface and lower-tropos-
pheric trends over the last two decades cannot be fully
reproduced by model simulations.

¢ Large uncertainties in estimates of internal climate variability
from models and observations, though as noted above, these are
unlikely (bordering on very unlikely) to be large enough to
nullify the claim that a detectable climate change has taken place.

Considerable uncertainty in the reconstructions of solar and
volcanic forcing which are based on proxy or limited observa-
tional data for all but the last two decades. Detection of the
influence of greenhouse gases on climate appears to be robust
to possible amplification of the solar forcing by ozone/solar or
solar/cloud interactions, provided these do not alter the pattern
or time dependence of the response to solar forcing.
Amplification of the solar signal by these processes, which are
not yet included in models, remains speculative.

¢ Large uncertainties in anthropogenic forcing are associated
with the effects of aerosols. The effects of some anthropogenic
factors, including organic carbon, black carbon, biomass
aerosols, and changes in land use, have not been included in
detection and attribution studies. Estimates of the size and
geographic pattern of the effects of these forcings vary consid-

There are new estimates of the climate response to natural and
anthropogenic forcing, and new detection techniques have been
applied. Detection and attribution studies consistently find
evidence for an anthropogenic signal in the climate record of the
last 35 to 50 years.

Simulations of the response to natural forcings alone (i.e., the
response to variability in solar irradiance and volcanic
eruptions) do not explain the warming in the second half of the
20th century. However, they indicate that natural forcings may
have contributed to the observed warming in the first half of the
20th century.

The warming over the last 50 years due to anthropogenic
greenhouse gases can be identified despite uncertainties in
forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate aerosol and natural
factors (volcanoes and solar irradiance). The anthropogenic
sulphate aerosol forcing, while uncertain, is negative over this
period and therefore cannot explain the warming. Changes in
natural forcing during most of this period are also estimated to
be negative and are unlikely to explain the warming.

"The response to anthropogenic changes in climate forcing occurs
against a backdrop of natural internal and externally forced
climate variability that can occur on similar temporal and spatial
scales. Internal climate variability, by which we mean climate
variability not forced by external agents, occurs on all time-scales
from weeks to centuries and millennia. Slow climate
components, such as the ocean, have particularly important roles
on decadal and century time-scales because they integrate high-
frequency weather variability (Hasselmann, 1976) and interact
with faster components. Thus the climate is capable of producing
long time-scale internal variations of considerable magnitude
without any external influences. Externally forced climate
variations may be due to changes in natural forcing factors, such
as solar radiation or volcanic aerosols, or to changes in anthro-

century. Any statement that a model simulation is consistent with
observed changes can only apply to a subset of model-simulated
variables, such as large-scale near-surface temperature trends: no
numerical model will ever be perfect in every respect. To attribute
all or part of recent climate change to human activity, therefore,
we need to demonstrate that alternative explanations, such as
pure internal variability or purely naturally forced climate
change, are unlikely to account for a set of observed changes that
can be accounted for by human influence. Detection (ruling out
that observed changes are only an instance of internal variability)
is thus one component of the more complex and demanding

detection (that some climate change has taken place), we shall
also discuss the detection of the influence of individual forcings

The presence of this natural climate variability means that the
detection and attribution of anthropogenic climate change is a
statistical “signal-in-noise” problem. Detection is the process of
demonstrating that an observed change is significantly different
(in a statistical sense) than can be explained by natural internal
variability. However, the detection of a change in climate does
not necessarily imply that its causes are understood. As noted in
the SAR, the unequivocal attribution of climate change to anthro-
pogenic causes (i.e., the isolation of cause and effect) would
require controlled experimentation with the climate system in
which the hypothesised agents of change are systematically
varied in order to determine the climate’s sensitivity to these
agents. Such an approach to attribution is clearly not possible.
Thus, from a practical perspective, attribution of observed
climate change to a given combination of human activity and
natural influences requires another approach. This involves statis-
tical analysis and the careful assessment of multiple lines of
evidence to demonstrate, within a pre-specified margin of error,
that the observed changes are:
"	Text
"The basic elements of this approach to detection and attribution
were recognised in the SAR. However, detection and attribution
studies have advanced beyond addressing the simple question
“have we detected a human influence on climate?” to such
questions as “how large is the anthropogenic change?” and “‘is the
magnitude of the response to greenhouse gas forcing as estimated
in the observed record consistent with the response simulated by
climate models?” The task of detection and attribution can thus be
rephrased as an estimation problem, with the quantities to be
estimated being the factor(s) by which we have to scale the model-
simulated response(s) to external forcing to be consistent with the
observed change. The estimation approach uses essentially the
same tools as earlier studies that considered the problem as one of
hypothesis testing, but is potentially more informative in that it
allows us to quantify, with associated estimates of uncertainty,
how much different factors have contributed to recent observed
climate changes. This interpretation only makes sense, however, if
it can be assumed that important sources of model error, such as
missing or incorrectly represented atmospheric feedbacks, affect
primarily the amplitude and not the structure of the response to
external forcing. The majority of relevant studies suggest that this
is the case for the relatively small-amplitude changes observed to
date, but the possibility of model errors changing both the
amplitude and structure of the response remains an important
caveat. Sampling error in model-derived signals that originates
from the model’s own internal variability also becomes an issue if
detection and attribution is considered as an estimation problem —
some investigations have begun to allow for this, and one study
has estimated the contribution to uncertainty from observational
sampling and instrumental error. The robustness of detection and
attribution findings obtained with different climate models has
been assessed.

The SAR judged that the observed trend in | global climate
over the previous 100 years was unlikely to be entirely natural in
origin. This led to the following, now well-known, conclusion:
“Our ability to quantify the human influence on global climate is
currently limited because the expected signal is still emerging
from the noise of natural variability, and because there are
uncertainties in key factors. Nevertheless, the balance of
evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on
global climate”. It also noted that the magnitude of the influence
was uncertain.

"Ideally, a detection and attribution study requires long records of
observed data for climate elements that have the potential to show
large climate change signals relative to natural variability. It is
also necessary that the observing system has sufficient coverage
so that the main features of natural variability and climate change
can be identified and monitored. A thorough assessment of
observed climate change, climate variability and data quality was
presented in Chapter 2. Most detection and attribution studies
have used near-surface air temperature, sea surface temperature
or upper air temperature data, as these best fit the requirement

"The first IPCC Scientific Assessment in 1990 (IPCC, 1990)
concluded that the global mean surface temperature had
increased by 0.3 to 0.6°C over the previous 100 years and that the
magnitude of this warming was broadly consistent with the
predictions of climate models forced by increasing concentra-
tions of greenhouse gases. However, it remained to be established
that the observed warming (or part of it) could be attributed to the
enhanced greenhouse effect. Some of the reasons for this were
that there was only limited agreement between model predictions
and observations, because climate models were still in the early
stages of development; there was inadequate knowledge of
natural variability and other possible anthropogenic effects on
climate and there was a scarcity of suitable observational data,
particularly long, reliable time-series.

By the time of the SAR in 1995, considerable progress had
been made in attempts to identify an anthropogenic effect on
climate. The first area of significant advance was that climate
models were beginning to incorporate the possible climatic
effects of human-induced changes in sulphate aerosols and
stratospheric ozone. The second area of progress was in better
defining the background variability of the climate system through
multi-century model experiments that assumed no changes in
forcing. These provided important information about the possible
characteristics of the internal component of natural climate
variability. The third area of progress was in the application of
pattern-based methods that attempted to attribute some part of
the observed changes in climate to human activities, although
these studies were still in their infancy at that time.

Both of these problems can be avoided by removing an
independent estimate of the externally forced response from the
observations before computing the power spectrum. This
independent estimate is provided by the ensemble mean of a
coupled model simulation of the response to the combination of
natural and anthropogenic forcing (see Figure 12.7c). The
resulting spectrum of observed variability (dotted line in Figure
12.2) will not be subject to a negative bias because the observed
data have not been used in estimating the forced response. It
will, however, be inflated by uncertainty in the model-simulated
forced response and by noise due to observation error and due to
incomplete coverage (particularly the bias towards relatively
noisy Northern Hemisphere land temperatures in the early part
of the observed series). This estimate of the observed spectrum
is therefore likely to overestimate power at all frequencies. Even
so, the more variable models display similar variance on the
decadal to inter-decadal time-scales important for detection and

of problems make this difficult. The instrumental record is short
relative to the 30 to 50 year time-scales that are of interest for

variables in the free atmosphere. The longest records that are
available are those for surface air temperature and sea surface
temperature. Relatively long records are also available for precip-
itation and surface pressure, but coverage is incomplete and
varies in time (see Chapter 2). The instrumental record also
contains the influences of external anthropogenic and natural
forcing. A record of natural internal variability can be
reconstructed by removing estimates of the response to external
forcing (for example, Jones and Hegerl, 1998; Wigley et al.,

incomplete knowledge of the forcings and by the accuracy of the

temperature in 500-year or longer simulations of the three

the variability of the first mode. The standard deviations of the
dominant modes of variability in the three models differ from
observations by less than a factor of two, and one model

in all leading modes. In general, one would expect to obtain
conservative detection and attribution results when natural
variability is estimated with such a model. One should also
expect control simulations to be less variable than observations

present climate models tend to underestimate variability on all
time-scales and, in particular, do not reproduce modes of
variability such as the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). On
decadal time-scales, the model simulated less variability than
observed in some aspects of the vertical patterns important for the
detection of anthropogenic climate change. The discrepancy is
partially resolved by the inclusion of anthropogenic (greenhouse
gas, sulphate and stratospheric ozone) forcing in the model.
However, the authors also find evidence that solar forcing plays a
significant role on decadal time-scales, indicating that this should

climate variability of coupled climate models and proxy time-
series for (mostly summer) decadal temperature (Jones et al.,

dominant proxy mode of variation is substantially less than
that estimated from the proxy data. However, choosing the

maximise the variance in the palaeo-data and not the models,

To detect the response to anthropogenic or natural climate forcing
in observations, we require estimates of the expected space-time
pattern of the response. The influences of natural and anthro-
pogenic forcing on the observed climate can be separated only if
the spatial and temporal variation of each component is known.
These patterns cannot be determined from the observed instru-
mental record because variations due to different external
forcings are superimposed on each other and on internal climate
variations. Hence climate models are usually used to estimate the
contribution from each factor. The models range from simpler
energy balance models to the most complex coupled atmosphere-
ocean general circulation models that simulate the spatial and
temporal variations of many climatic parameters (Chapter 8).

"These findings emphasise that there is still considerable
uncertainty in the magnitude of internal climate variability.
Various approaches are used in detection and attribution studies
to account for this uncertainty. Some studies use data from a
number of coupled climate model control simulations (Santer et
al., 1995; Hegerl et al., 1996, 1997, North and Stevens, 1998) and
choose the most conservative result. In other studies, the estimate
of internal variance is inflated to assess the sensitivity of
detection and attribution results to the level of internal variance
(Santer ef al., 1996a, Tett et al., 1999; Stott et al., 2001). Some
authors also augment model-derived estimates of natural
variability with estimates from observations (Hegerl et al., 1996).
A method for checking the consistency between the residual
variability in the observations after removal of externally forced
signals (see equation A12.1.1, Appendix 12.1) and the natural
internal variability estimated from control simulations is also
available (e.g., Allen and Tett, 1999). Results indicate that, on the
scales considered, there is no evidence for a serious inconsistency
between the variability in models used for optimal fingerprint
studies and observations (Allen and Tett, 1999; Tett er al., 1999;
Hegerl et al., 2000, 2001; Stott et al., 2001). The use of this test
and the use of internal variability from the models with the
greatest variability increases confidence in conclusions derived
from optimal detection studies.

Reconstructions of climate forcing in the 20th century
indicate that the net natural climate forcing probably increased
during the first half of the 20th century, due to a period of low
volcanism coinciding with a small increase in solar forcing.
Recent decades show negative natural forcing due to increasing
volcanism, which overwhelms the direct effect, if real, of a small
increase in solar radiation (see Chapter 6, Table 6.13).

satellite and other data to be -3 Wm? (peak forcing; after
Hansen et al., 1998). The forcing associated with historic

observations over the last century (see also Stothers, 1996;
Grieser and Schoenwiese, 1999). Prior to that, reconstructions
have been based on various sources of data (ice cores, historic

In practice, the response of a given model to different forcing
patterns can be quite similar (Hegerl et al., 1997; North and
Stevens, 1998; Tett et al., 1999). Similar signal patterns (a
condition often referred to as “‘degeneracy”) can be difficult to
distinguish from one another. Tett et al. (1999) find substantial
degeneracy between greenhouse gas, sulphate, volcanic and solar
patterns they used in their detection study using HadCM2. On the
other hand, the greenhouse gas and aerosol patterns generated by
ECHAMS3 LSG (Heger! et al., 2000) are more clearly separable,
in part because the patterns are more distinct, and in part because
the aerosol response pattern correlates less well with ECHAM3
LSG’s patterns of internal variability. The vertical patterns of
temperature change due to greenhouse gas and stratospheric
ozone forcing are less degenerate than the horizontal patterns.

"There are several reasons why one should not expect a simple
relationship between the patterns of radiative forcing and temper-
ature response. First, strong feedbacks such as those due to water
vapour and sea ice tend to reduce the difference in the tempera-
ture response due to different forcings. This is illustrated graphi-
cally by the response to the simplified aerosol forcing used in
early studies. The magnitude of the model response is largest
over the Arctic in winter even though the forcing is small, largely
due to ice-albedo feedback. The large-scale patterns of change
and their temporal variations are similar, but of opposite sign, to
that obtained in greenhouse gas experiments (Figure 12.3, see
also Mitchell et al., 1995a). Second, atmospheric circulation
tends to smooth out temperature gradients and reduce the differ-
ences in response patterns. Similarly, the thermal inertia of the
climate system tends to reduce the amplitude of short-term
fluctuations in forcing. Third, changes in radiative forcing are
more effective if they act near the surface, where cooling to space
is restricted, than at upper levels, and in high latitudes, where
there are stronger positive feedbacks than at low latitudes
(Hansen et al., 1997a).

"The variation of solar irradiance with the 11-year sunspot cycle
has been assessed with some accuracy over more than 20 years,
although measurements of the magnitude of modulations of solar
irradiance between solar cycles are less certain (see Chapter 6).
The estimation of earlier solar irradiance fluctuations, although
based on physical mechanisms, is indirect. Hence our confidence
in the range of solar radiation on century time-scales is low, and
confidence in the details of the time-history is even lower
(Harrison and Shine, 1999; Chapter 6). Several recent reconstruc-
tions estimate that variations in solar irradiance give rise to a
forcing at the Earth’s surface of about 0.6 to 0.7 Wm” since the
Maunder Minimum and about half this over the 20th century (see
Chapter 6, Figure 6.5; Hoyt and Schatten, 1993; Lean er al.,
1995; Lean, 1997; Froehlich and Lean, 1998; Lockwood and
Stamper, 1999). This is larger than the 0.2 Wm~? modulation of
the 11-year solar cycle measured from satellites. (Note that we
discuss here the forcing at the Earth’s surface, which is smaller
than that at the top of the atmosphere, due to the Earth’s geometry
and albedo.) The reconstructions of Lean et al. (1995) and Hoyt
and Schatten (1993), which have been used in GCM detection
studies, vary in amplitude and phase. Chapter 6, Figure 6.8 shows
time-series of reconstructed solar and volcanic forcing since the
late 18th century. All reconstructions indicate that the direct
effect of variations in solar forcing over the 20th century was
about 20 to 25% of the change in forcing due to increases in the
well-mixed greenhouse gases (see Chapter 6).

"Since the SAR, there have been new modelling and observational

small (e.g., Cubasch et al., 1997; White et al., 1997; North and

Low-frequency solar variability over the last few hundred years

the hypothesised solar forcing minimum and some warming in the

0.5°C in response to the estimated 0.7 Wm change of solar
radiative forcing from the Maunder Minimum to the present (e.g.,

stratospheric warming after the volcanic eruption, superimposed
on a long-term cooling trend. Although the surface temperature
response in the Northern Hemisphere warm season following a
volcanic eruption is dominated by global scale radiative cooling,
some models simulate local warming over Eurasia and North
America in the cold season due to changes in circulation (e.g.,
Graf et al., 1996; Kirchner ef al., 1999). Variability from other
sources makes assessment of the observed climate response
difficult, particularly as the two most recent volcanic eruptions

1990s due to several volcanic eruptions in those decades. Some
simulations also produce global warming in the early 20th
century as a recovery from a series of strong eruptions around the
turn of the 20th century. It is unclear whether such a long-term

We conclude that climate forcing by changes in solar irradiance
and volcanism have likely caused fluctuations in global and
hemispheric mean temperatures. Qualitative comparisons
suggest that natural forcings produce too little warming to fully
explain the 20th century warming (see Figure 12.7). The indica-
tion that the trend in net solar plus volcanic forcing has been
negative in recent decades (see Chapter 6) makes it unlikely that
natural forcing can explain the increased rate of global warming
since the middle of the 20th century. This question will be

"As discussed earlier in Section 12.2.3, differences between
the response to solar and greenhouse gas forcings would make it
easier to distinguish the climate response to either forcing.
However, the spatial response pattern of surface air temperature
to an increase in solar forcing was found to be quite similar to that
in response to increases in greenhouse gas forcing (e.g., Cubasch
et al., 1997). The vertical response to solar forcing (Figure 12.5)
includes warming throughout most of the troposphere. The
response in the stratosphere is small and possibly locally
negative, but less so than with greenhouse gas forcing, which
gives tropospheric warming and strong stratospheric cooling. The
dependence of solar forcing on wavelength and the effect of solar
fluctuations on ozone were generally omitted in these simula-
tions. Hence, the conclusion that changes in solar forcing have
little effect on large-scale stratospheric temperatures remains
tentative.

In the SAR (Santer ef al., 1996c), pattern-based detection studies
took into account changes in well-mixed greenhouse gases (often
represented by an equivalent increase in CO3), the direct effect of
sulphate aerosols (usually represented by a seasonally constant
change in surface albedo) and the influence of changes in strato-
spheric ozone. Recent studies have also included the effect of
increases in tropospheric ozone and a representation of the
indirect effect of sulphate aerosols on cloud albedo. Many
models now include the individual greenhouse gases (as opposed
to a CO) equivalent) and include an interactive sulphur cycle and
an explicit treatment of scattering by aerosols (as opposed to
using prescribed changes in surface albedo). Note that represen-
tation of the sulphur cycle in climate models is not as detailed as
in the offline sulphur cycle models reported in Chapter 5.
Detection and attribution studies to date have not taken into
account other forcing agents discussed in Chapter 6, including
biogenic aerosols, black carbon, mineral dust and changes in land
use. Estimates of the spatial and temporal variation of these
factors have not been available long enough to have been
included in model simulations suitable for detection studies. In
general, the neglected forcings are estimated to be small globally
and there may be a large degree of cancellation in their global
mean effect (see Chapter 6, Figure 6.8). It is less clear that the
individual forcings will cancel regionally. As discussed in Section

In order to assess temperature changes over the last two
decades, Hansen et al. (1997b) estimated the net radiative forcing
due to changes in greenhouse gases (including ozone), solar
variations and stratospheric aerosols from 1979 to 1995 from the
best available measurements of the forcing agents. The negative
forcing due to volcanoes and decreases in stratospheric ozone
compensated for a substantial fraction of the increase in
greenhouse gas forcing in this period (see Chapter 6, Table 6.13).

and possibly large negative contribution from the indirect effects
of aerosols. Other factors such as that due to increases in fossil
fuel organic carbon, aviation, changes in land use and mineral dust
are very poorly known and not yet incorporated into simulations

believed to be small relative to well-mixed greenhouse gases,

Increases in greenhouse gases lead to a warming of the
troposphere and a cooling of the stratosphere due to CO, (IPCC,
1996). Reductions in stratospheric ozone lead to a further cooling,
particularly in the stratosphere at high latitudes. Anthropogenic
sulphate aerosols cool the troposphere with little effect on the
stratosphere. When these three forcings are included in a climate
model (e.g., Tett et al., 1996, 2000) albeit in a simplified way, the
simulated changes show tropospheric warming and stratospheric
cooling, as observed and as expected on physical principles

Many of the new detection studies take into account the spatial
variation of climate response, which will depend to some extent
on the pattern of forcing (see also Section 12.2.3). The patterns of
forcing vary considerably (see Chapter 6, Figure 6.7). The
magnitude of the overall forcing due to increases in well-mixed
greenhouse gases varies from almost 3 Wm"" in the sub-tropics
to about 1 Wm”? around the poles. The warming due to increases
in tropospheric ozone is mainly in the tropics and northern sub-
tropics. Decreases in stratospheric ozone observed over the last
couple of decades have produced negative forcing of up to about
0.5 Wm? around Antarctica. The direct effect of sulphate
aerosols predominates in the Northern Hemisphere industrial
regions where the negative forcing may exceed 2 Wm locally.

Some of the new detection studies take into account the temporal

as well as spatial variations in climate response (see Section
12.4.3.3). Hence the temporal variation of forcing is also
important. The forcing due to well-mixed greenhouse gases (and
tropospheric ozone) has increased slowly in the first half of the
century, and much more rapidly in recent decades (Chapter 6,
Figure 6.8). Contributions from other factors are smaller and
more uncertain. Sulphur emissions increased steadily until World
War I, then levelled off, and increased more rapidly in the 1950s,
though not as fast as greenhouse gas emissions. This is reflected
in estimates of the direct radiative effect of increases in sulphate
aerosols. Given the almost monotonic increase in greenhouse gas
forcing in recent decades, this means the ratio of sulphate to
greenhouse gas forcing has probably been decreasing since about
1960 (see Chapter 6, Figure 6.8). This should be borne in mind
when considering studies that attempt to detect a response to
sulphate aerosols. The decreases in stratospheric ozone have been
confined to the last two to three decades.

We now consider the simulated response to anthropogenic
forcing. Models run with increases in greenhouse gases alone
give a warming which accelerates in the latter half of the century.
When a simple representation of aerosol effects is included
(Mitchell et al., 1995b; Cubasch et al., 1996; Haywood et al.,
1997; Boer et al., 2000a,b) the rate of warming is reduced (see
also Chapter 8, Section 8.6.1). The global mean response is
similar when additional forcings due to ozone and the indirect
effect of sulphates are included. GCM simulations (Tett ef al.,
1996; Hansen et al., 1997b) indicate that changes in stratospheric
ozone observed over the last two decades yield a global mean
surface temperature cooling of about 0.1 to 0.2°C. This may be
too small to be distinguishable from the model’s internal
variability and is also smaller than the warming effects due to the
changes in the well-mixed greenhouse gases over the same time
period (about 0.2 to 0.3°C). The lack of a statistically significant
surface temperature change is in contrast to the large ozone-
induced cooling in the lower stratosphere (WMO, 1999;

signals plus noise (see Appendices 12.1 and 12.2). Other
approaches, such as pattern correlation (Santer ef al., 1995,
1996a; see also Appendix 12.3), complement the regression
approach, being particularly valuable in cases where model-
simulated response patterns are particularly uncertain. In all
cases, the signal patterns are obtained from climate models. In the
regression approach, the unknown signal amplitudes are
estimated from observations. The uncertainty of these estimates
that is caused by natural variability in the observations is
expressed with confidence intervals. Detection of an individual
signal is achieved when the confidence interval for its amplitude
does not include zero. Overall detection (that some climate
change has taken place) is achieved when the joint confidence
interval on the signals considered does not encompass the origin.

Detection and attribution studies performed up to the SAR used
fixed signal patterns that did not evolve with time. These studies
were hampered because the mean large-scale response of climate
to different types of anomalous forcing tends to be similar (e.g.,
Mitchell er al., 1995a; Reader and Boer, 1998; see also Figure
12.3). Recent studies have been able to distinguish more clearly
between signals from anthropogenic and other sources by
including information from climate models about their temporal
evolution. Tett et al. (1999, 2000) and Stott et al. (2001) in related
studies have used a space-time approach in which the signal
pattern evolves on the decadal time-scale over a 50-year period.
North and Wu (2001) also use a space-time approach. North and
Stevens (1998) used a related space-frequency approach (see

"The use of climate models to estimate natural internal variability
Climate models play a critical role in these studies because they
provide estimates of natural internal variability as well as the
signals. In most studies an estimate of natural internal variability
is needed to optimise the search for the signal and this is usually
obtained from a long control simulation. In addition, a separate
estimate of natural variability is required to determine the
uncertainty of the amplitude estimates. Unfortunately, the short
instrumental record gives only uncertain estimates of variability
on the 30 to 50 year time-scales that are important for detection
and attribution and palaeo-data presently lacks the necessary
spatial coverage (see Section 12.2.2). Thus a second control
integration is generally used to estimate the uncertainty of the
amplitude estimates that arises from natural climate variability
(e.g., Hegerl et al., 1996; Tett et al., 1999).

While a growing number of long control simulations are
becoming available, there remain limitations on the spatial scales
that can be included in global scale detection and attribution
studies. Present day control simulations, which range from 300 to
about 2,000 years in length, are not long enough to simultane-
ously estimate internal variability on the 30 to 50 year time-scale
over a broad range of spatial scales. Consequently, detection and
attribution studies are conducted in a reduced space that includes
only large spatial scales. This space is selected so that it
represents the signals well and allows reliable estimation of
internal variability on the scales retained (see Appendix 12.4).
Recently, the scale selection process has been augmented with a
statistical procedure that checks for consistency between model
simulated and observed variability on the scales that are retained
(Allen and Tett, 1999).

"Most studies have assumed that signal patterns are noise free.
This is a reasonable assumption for fixed pattern studies (see
Appendix 12.2) but space-time estimates of the 20th century
climate change obtained from small ensembles of forced climate
simulations are contaminated by the model’s internal variability.
Allen and Tett (1999) point out that noise in the signal patterns
will tend to make the standard detection algorithm (e.g.,
Hasselmann, 1993, 1997) somewhat conservative. Methods for
accommodating this source of noise have been available for more
than a century (Adcock, 1878; see also Ripley and Thompson,
1987). Allen and Stott (2000) recently applied such a method and
found that, while the question of which signals could be detected
was generally unaffected, the estimated amplitude of individual
signals was sensitive to this modification of the procedure.
Another source of uncertainty concerns differences in signal
patterns between different models. Recent studies (Allen et al.,
2000a,b; Barnett et al., 2000; Hegerl et al., 2000) consider the
sensitivity of detection and attribution results to these differences.

"studies, including Hegerl et al. (1997, 2000) and Tett et al. (1999,
2000) have performed an “attribution” consistency test that is
designed to detect inconsistency between observed and model
projected signal amplitudes. This test is a useful adjunct to
detection because it provides an objective means of identifying
model-simulated signal amplitudes that are significantly different
from those estimated from observations. However, the test does
not give the final word on attribution because it is designed to
identify evidence of inconsistency rather than evidence for
consistency between modelled and observed estimates of signal
strength. A further refinement (e.g., Stott et al., 2001) is to
consider the full range of signals believed, on physical grounds,
to be likely to have had a significant impact on recent climate
change and to identify those subsets of these signals that are
consistent with recent observations. If all these subsets contain an
anthropogenic component, for example, then at least part of the
observed change can be attributed to anthropogenic influence.
Levine and Berliner (1999) point out that a test that searches for
consistency is available (Brown et al., 1995), but it has not yet
been used in attribution studies. Bayesian statisticians approach
the problem more directly by estimating the posterior probability
that the signal amplitudes projected by climate models are close
to those in the observed climate. Berliner et al. (2000) provides a
demonstration.

the observed changes in the vertical in terms of natural forcings
alone, as discussed in Section 12.2.3.2 (see Figure 12.8).
However, there are some inconsistencies between the observed
and modelled vertical patterns of temperature change.
Observations indicate that, over the last three to four decades, the
tropical atmosphere has warmed in the layer up to about 300 hPa
and cooled above (Parker et al., 1997; Gaffen et al., 2000). Model
simulations of the recent past produce a warming of the tropical

not seen in the observations. This discrepancy is less evident
when co-located model and radiosonde data are used (Santer et
al., 2000), or if volcanic forcing is taken into account, but does
not go away entirely (Bengtsson et al., 1999; Brown et al.,

ocean temperatures, retreat of glaciers, and reductions in Arctic
sea-ice extent and in snow cover, are consistent with the recent

projections of the response to increasing greenhouse gases. Other
observed changes in thermal indicators include a reduction in the
mean annual cycle (winters warming faster than summers) and in
the mean diurnal temperature range (nights warming faster than
days) over land (see Chapter 2). While the changes in annual
cycle are consistent with most model projections, the observed
changes in diurnal temperature range are larger than simulated in
most models for forcings due to increasing greenhouse gases and
sulphate aerosols this century (see Chapters 2 and 8). However,
the spatial and temporal coverage of data for changes in observed
diurnal temperature range is less than for changes in mean
temperatures, leading to greater uncertainty in the observed
global changes (Karoly and Braganza, 2001; Schnur, 2001).
Also, the observed reductions in diurnal temperature range are

not simulated well by models. Few models include the indirect

When anthropogenic factors are included, models provide a
plausible explanation of the changes in global mean temperature
over the last hundred years (Figure 12.7). It is conceivable that
this agreement between models and observations is spurious. For
example, if a model’s response to greenhouse gas increases is too
large (small) and the sulphate aerosol forcing too large (small),
these errors could compensate. Differences in the spatio-temporal
patterns of response to greenhouse gases and sulphate forcing
nevertheless allow some discrimination between them, so this
compensation is not complete. On the other hand, when forced
with known natural forcings, models produce a cooling over the
second half of the 20th century (see Figure 12.7) rather than the
warming trend shown in the observed record. The discrepancy is
too large to be explained through model estimates of internal
variability and unlikely to be explained through uncertainty in
forcing history (Tett et al., 2000). Schneider and Held (2001)
applied a technique to isolate those spatial patterns of decadal
climate change in observed surface temperature data over the
20th century which are most distinct from interannual variability.
They find a spatial pattern which is similar to model-simulated
greenhouse gas and sulphate aerosol fingerprints in both July and
December. The time evolution of this pattern shows a strong
trend with little influence of interannual variability. (Note that
this technique is related to optimal fingerprinting, but does not
use prior information on the pattern of expected climate change.)

Model simulations of large-scale changes in tropospheric and
surface temperatures are generally statistically consistent with the
observed changes (see Section 12.4). However, models generally
predict an enhanced rate of warming in the mid- to upper
troposphere over that at the surface (i.e., a negative lapse-rate
feedback on the surface temperature change) whereas observa-
tions show mid-tropospheric temperatures warming no faster
than surface temperatures. It is not clear whether this discrepancy
arises because the lapse-rate feedback is consistently over-
represented in climate models or because of other factors such as
observational error or neglected forcings (Santer et al., 2000).
Note that if models do simulate too large a negative lapse-rate

troposphere actually may have warmed much less rapidly than the
surface from 1979 to the late 1990s, due both to natural causes
(e.g., the sequence of volcanic eruptions that occurred within this
particular 20-year period) and human activities (e.g., the cooling
in the upper troposphere resulting from ozone depletion in the
stratosphere)” (see also Santer ef al., 2000). They also concluded
that “‘it is not currently possible to determine whether or not there
exists a fundamental discrepancy between modelled and observed
atmospheric temperature changes since the advent of satellite data
in 1979”. Over the last 40 years, observed warming trends in the
lower troposphere and at the surface are similar, indicating that the
lower troposphere warmed faster than the surface for about two
decades prior to 1979 (Brown et al., 2000a; Gaffen et al., 2000).
However, in the extra-tropical Eurasian winter some additional
warming of the surface relative to the lower or mid-troposphere

stronger polar vortex in the winter lower stratosphere and, in the
Northern Hemisphere, winter warming over the western parts of
the continents associated with increased warm advection from
ocean regions. The trend is significant and cannot be explained
by internal variability in some models (Gillett et al., 2000b).
These dynamical changes explain only part of the observed
Northern Hemisphere warming (Gillett et al., 2000b; Thompson
et al., 2000). Modelling studies suggest a number of possible
causes of these circulation changes, including greenhouse gas
increases (Fyfe et al., 1999; Paeth et al., 1999; Shindell er al.,
1999) and stratospheric ozone decreases (Graf et al., 1998;
Volodin and Galin, 1999). Some studies have also shown that
volcanic eruptions (Graf et al., 1998; Mao and Robock, 1998;
Kirchner er al., 1999) can induce such changes in circulation on
interannual time-scales. Shindell et al. (2001) show that both
solar and volcanic forcing are unlikely to explain the recent
trends in the annular modes.

An extension of the analysis of global mean temperature is to
compare the spatial structure of observed trends (see Chapter 2,
Section 2.2.2.4) with those simulated by models in coupled
control simulations. Knutson et al. (2000) examined observed
1949 to 1997 surface temperature trends and found that over
about half the globe they are significantly larger than expected
from natural low-frequency internal variability as simulated in
long control simulations with the GFDL model (Figure 12.9). A
similar result was obtained by Boer er al. (2000a) using 1900 to
1995 trends. The level of agreement between observed and
simulated trends increases substantially in both studies when
observations are compared with simulations that incorporate
transient greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosol forcing (compare
Figure 12.9c with Figure 12.9d, see also Chapter 8, Figure 8.18).
While there are areas, such as the extra-tropical Pacific and North
Atlantic Ocean, where the GFDL model warms significantly
more than has been observed, the anthropogenic climate change
simulations do provide a plausible explanation of temperature
trends over the last century over large areas of the globe.
Delworth and Knutson (2000) find that one in five of their anthro-
pogenic climate change simulations showed a similar evolution
of global mean surface temperature over the 20th century to that
observed, with strong warming, particularly in the high latitude
North Atlantic, in the first half of the century. This would suggest
that the combination of anthropogenic forcing and internal
variability may be sufficient to account for the observed early-
century warming (as suggested by, e.g., Hegerl et al., 1996),
although other recent studies have suggested that natural forcing
may also have contributed to the early century warming (see
Section 12.4.3).

centred correlation in detection studies. They argued that correla-

diverge. This was precisely the reason centred correlations were
introduced (e.g., Santer et al., 1993): to provide an indicator that
was statistically independent of global mean temperature
changes. If both global mean changes and centred pattern correla-

Results from studies using pattern correlations were reported
extensively in the SAR (for example, Santer er al., 1995, 1996c;
Mitchell et al., 1995b). They found that the patterns of simulated
surface temperature change due to the main anthropogenic
factors in recent decades are significantly closer to those
observed than expected by chance. Pattern correlations have been
used because they are simple and are insensitive to errors in the
amplitude of the spatial pattern of response and, if centred, to the
global mean response. They are also less sensitive than regres-
sion-based optimal detection techniques to sampling error in the
model-simulated response. The aim of pattern-correlation studies
is to use the differences in the large-scale patterns of response, or
“fingerprints”, to distinguish between different causes of climate
change.

that natural variability is unlikely to be an explanation for the

explanation. Zheng and Basher (1999) use similar time-series
models and show that deterministic trends are detectable over a

balancing cooling due to sulphate aerosols is 0.2 to 0.4°C.
Similar results are obtained with a multiple regression model

the lagged-covariance structure of hemispheric mean temperature

in the two hemispheres. Smith et al. (2001), using similar

There are some difficulties in assessing the statistical signifi-

temperature profile. First, the observational record is short, and
subject to error, particularly at upper levels (Chapter 2). Second,
the model estimates of variability may not be realistic (Section
12.2.2), particularly in the stratosphere. Third, because of data
and model limitations, the number of levels used to represent
the stratosphere in detection studies to date is small, and hence
may not be adequate to allow an accurate representation of the
stratospheric response. Fourth, all models produce a maximum

al. (2001), that using an earlier base period can enhance
detectability, but that much of this advantage is lost when the
reduced data coverage of earlier base periods is taken into
account. They also found that reasonable combinations of
greenhouse gas and aerosol patterns are more easily detected than
the greenhouse gas pattern on its own. This last result indicates the

from the transient AOGCM simulations, additional sensitivity
studies and estimates of internal variability from three different

simulated patterns for the full atmosphere was significantly
different from the population of 25-year trends in the control

"Weber (1996) and Michaels and Knappenburger (1996) both
criticised the Santer et al. (1996a) results, quoting upper air
measurements analysed by Angell (1994). Weber argued that the
increasing pattern similarity over the full atmosphere (850 to 50
hPa) resulted mainly from a Southern Hemisphere cooling
associated with stratospheric ozone depletion. Santer ef al.
(1996b) pointed out that when known biases in the radiosonde
data are removed (e.g., Parker et al., 1997), or satellite or
operationally analysed data are used, the greater stratospheric
cooling in the Southern Hemisphere all but disappears. Weber
(1996) is correct that stratospheric cooling due to ozone will
contribute to the pattern similarity over the full atmosphere, but
decreases in stratospheric ozone alone would be expected to
produce a tropospheric cooling, not a warming as observed. This
point should be born in mind when considering a later criticism
of the pattern correlation approach. Both Weber (1996) and
Michaels and Knappenburger (1996) note that the greater
warming of the Southern Hemisphere relative to the Northern
Hemisphere from 1963 to 1988 has since reversed. They attribute
the Southern Hemisphere warming from 1963 to the recovery
from the cooling following the eruption of Mount Agung. Santer
et al. (1996b) claim that this change in asymmetry is to be
expected, because the heating due to increases in greenhouse
gases over the most recent years has probably been growing
faster than the estimated cooling due to increases in aerosols (see
Section 12.2.3.3). Calculations of the difference in the rate of
warming between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres vary
between different climate models and as a function of time,
depending on the relative forcing due to greenhouse gases and
sulphate aerosols, and on the simulated rate of oceanic heat
uptake in the Southern Hemisphere (Santer et al., 1996b; Karoly

it lies along OB. The signal to noise ratio is given by OB/OBn. Because our signal lies close to the direction of the main component
of variability, the signal to noise ratio is small. On the other hand, we can choose a direction OC that overlaps less with the main
component of natural variability such that the signal to noise ratio OC/OCn for the component of the signal that lies in direction
OC is larger even though the projected signal OC is smaller then the full signal OB. Optimal detection techniques merely choose
the direction OC that maximises the signal to noise ratio. This is equivalent to general linear regression (see Appendix 12.1). A good
estimate of natural internal variability is required to optimise effectively.

As in the single-pattern case, this study has been extended to
include seven model GS simulations and to take into account
observational sampling error (Figure 12.10b,c, see also Barnett et
al., 1999; Hegerl et al. 2001). A simple linear transformation
allows results to be displayed in terms of individual greenhouse
and sulphate signal amplitudes, which assists comparison with
other results (see Figure 12.10; Hegerl and Allen, 2000). The
amplitudes of the greenhouse gas and sulphate components are
simultaneously consistent with the observed amplitudes in 10 of
the fourteen GS cases (seven models for two sets of fingerprints)
displayed. This contrasts with eleven out of fourteen in the
combined amplitude test described in Section 12.4.3.1. If the trends
to 1995 are used (Figure 12.10c), the results are similar, though in
this case, the ellipse just includes the origin and six out of the
fourteen GS cases are consistent with observations. The inconsis-
tency can be seen to be mainly due to large variations in the
amplitudes of the model-simulated responses to sulphate aerosols
(indicated by the vertical spread of results). Model-simulated
responses to greenhouse gases are generally more consistent both
with each other and with observations. Two of the cases of
disagreement are based on a single simulation rather than an
ensemble mean and should therefore be viewed with caution (see
Barnett et al., 2000). Barnett et al. (1999) found that the degree of
agreement between the five models and observations they consid-
ered was similar, whether or not the global mean response was
removed from the patterns. Signal amplitudes from simulations
with greenhouse gas forcing only are generally inconsistent with
those estimated from observations (Figure 12.10b,c).

In summary, the fixed pattern studies indicate that the recent
warming is unlikely (bordering on very unlikely) to be due to
internal climate variability. A substantial response to anthro-
pogenic greenhouse gases appears to be necessary to account for
recent temperature trends but the majority of studies indicate that
greenhouse gases alone do not appear to be able to provide a full
explanation. Inclusion of the response to the direct effect of
sulphate aerosols usually leads to a more satisfactory explanation
of the observed changes, although the amplitude of the sulphate
signal depends on the model used. These studies also provide
some evidence that solar variations may have contributed to the
early century warming.

the GS simulations in both panels are in agreement with observed trend patterns, discrepancies arise mostly from the magnitude of a sulphate signal

Given the uncertainties in sulphate aerosol and natural
forcings and responses, these single-pattern confidence intervals
give an incomplete picture. We cannot assume that the response
to sulphate forcing (relative to the greenhouse signal) is as
simulated in these greenhouse-plus-sulphate simulations; nor can
we assume the net response to natural forcing is negligible even
though observations of surface temperature changes over the past
30 to 50 years are generally consistent with both these assump-
tions. Hence we need also to consider uncertainty ranges based
on estimating several signals simultaneously (Figure 12.12, right
hand panels). These are generally larger than the single-signal
estimates because we are attempting to estimate more informa-
tion from the same amount of data (Tett er al., 1999; Allen and
Stott, 2000; Allen er al., 2000a). Nevertheless, the conclusion of
a substantial greenhouse contribution to the recent observed

"A variety of sensitivity tests confirm that the detection of anthro-
pogenic signals is insensitive to differences between solar forcing
reconstructions, the inclusion of additional forcing through the
specification of observed stratospheric ozone concentrations, and
to varying details of the analysis (including omitting the signal-
to-noise optimisation). Tett et al. (1999, 2000) also found that
detection of an anthropogenic signal continues to hold even when
the standard deviation of the control simulation is inflated by a
factor of two. Uncertainty in the signals is unavoidable when
ensembles are small, as is the case in Tett et al. (1999), and biases
the estimates of the signal amplitudes towards zero. Consistent
results are obtained when this source of uncertainty is taken into
account (Allen and Stott, 2000; Stott et al., 2000a). However
amplitude estimates become more uncertain, particularly if the
underlying signal is small compared with internal climate
variability. Accounting for sampling uncertainty in model-
simulated signals indicates a greater degree of greenhouse
warming and compensating aerosol cooling in the latter part of
the century than shown by Tett er al. (1999). Gillett et al. (2000b)
find that discounting the temperature changes associated with
changes in the Arctic Oscillation (Thompson and Wallace, 1998;
Thompson et al., 2000), which are not simulated by the model,
does not significantly alter the Tett et al. (1999) results.

other model simulations (Figure 12.12) and found that the
modelled response to the combination of greenhouse gas and

scaling factors ranging from 0.8 to 1.2 and the corresponding
95% confidence intervals cover the range 0.5 to 1.6. Scaling
factors for 50-year JJA trends are also easily derived from the
results published in Hegerl et al. (2000). The resulting range of
factors is consistent with that of Allen et al. (2000a), but wider
because the diagnostic used in Allen et al. (2000b) enhances the
signal-to-noise ratio. If it is assumed that the combination of
greenhouse warming and sulphate cooling simulated by these
AOGCMs is the only significant external contributor to inter-
decadal near-surface temperature changes over the latter half of
the 20th century, then Allen et al. (2000a) estimate that the

Figure 12.13 also shows that a similar range of uncertainty is
obtained if the greenhouse gas and sulphate components are
estimated separately, in which case the estimate of future
warming for this particular scenario is independent of possible
errors in the amplitude of the sulphate forcing and response. Most
of the recent emission scenarios indicate that future sulphate
emissions will decrease rather than increase in the near future.
This would lead to a larger global warming since the greenhouse
gas component would no longer be reduced by sulphate forcing at
the same rate as in the past. The level of uncertainty also increases
(see Allen et al., 2000b). The final error bar in Figure 12.13 shows
that including the model-simulated response to natural forcing

greenhouse (G), sulphate (S), solar-plus-volcanic (N), solar-only (So) and volcanic-only (V) signals for those cases in which the relevant simula-
tions have been performed. In these cases, we estimate multiple factors simultaneously to account for uncertainty in the amplitude of the naturally
forced response. The uncertainties increase but the greenhouse signal remains consistently detectable. In one case (ECHAM3) the model appears
to be overestimating the greenhouse response (scaling range in the G signal inconsistent with unity), but this result is sensitive to which
component of the control is used to define the detection space. It is also not known how it would respond to the inclusion of a volcanic signal. In
cases where both solar and volcanic forcing is included (HadCM2 and HadCM3), G and S signals remain detectable and consistent with unity
independent of whether natural signals are estimated jointly or separately (allowing for different errors in S and V responses). (b) Estimated

a significant contribution from anthropogenic climate change to 20th century warming (from Allen er al., 2000a).

the corresponding changes in the observed record. The vertical bars indicate the 5 to 95% uncertainty range due to internal variability. A range
encompassing unity implies that this combination of forcing amplitude and model-simulated response is consistent with the corresponding
observed change, while a range encompassing zero implies that this model-simulated signal is not detectable (Allen and Stott, 2000; Stott er al.,
2000a). Signals are defined as the ensemble mean response to external forcing expressed in large-scale (>5000 km) near-surface temperatures over
the 1946 to 1996 period relative to the 1896 to 1996 mean. The first entry (G) shows the scaling factor and 5 to 95% confidence interval obtained
if we assume the observations consist only of a response to greenhouse gases plus internal variability. The range is significantly less than one
(consistent with results from other models), meaning that models forced with greenhouse gases alone significantly overpredict the observed
warming signal. The next eight entries show scaling factors for model-simulated responses to greenhouse and sulphate forcing (GS), with two
cases including indirect sulphate and tropospheric ozone forcing, one of these also including stratospheric ozone depletion (GSI and GSIO respec-
tively). All but one (CGCM1) of these ranges is consistent with unity. Hence there is little evidence that models are systematically over- or under-
predicting the amplitude of the observed response under the assumption that model-simulated GS signals and internal variability are an adequate
representation (i.e. that natural forcing has had little net impact on this diagnostic). Observed residual variability is consistent with this assumption
in all but one case (ECHAM3, indicated by the asterisk). We are obliged to make this assumption to include models for which only a simulation
of the anthropogenic response is available, but uncertainty estimates in these single-signal cases are incomplete since they do not account for
uncertainty in the naturally forced response. These ranges indicate, however, the high level of confidence with which we can reject internal
variability as simulated by these various models as an explanation of recent near-surface temperature change.

influence on global climate and yield better-constrained
estimates of the magnitude of anthropogenic signals than
approaches using spatial information alone. In particular, the
inclusion of temporal information can reduce the degeneracy

The SAR predicted an increase in the anthropogenic contri-
bution to global mean temperature of slightly over 0.1°C in the
five years following the SAR, which is consistent with the
observed change since the SAR (Chapter 2). The predicted
increase in the anthropogenic signal (and the observed change)
are small compared to natural variability, so it is not possible to
distinguish an anthropogenic signal from natural variability on
five year time-scales.

which any human influence on climate could be quantified. It
was noted that detection and attribution of anthropogenic climate

accumulation of evidence, and that there were appreciable
uncertainties in the magnitude and patterns of natural variability,
and in the radiative forcing and climate response resulting from
human activity.

its own is generally insufficient to explain the observed changes
in temperature over the last few decades. However, for all but the
most recent two decades, the accuracy of the estimates of forcing

irradiance and on limited surface data for volcanoes. There are
some indications that solar irradiance fluctuations have indirect
effects in addition to direct radiative heating, for example due to
the substantially stronger variation in the UV band and its effect
on ozone, or hypothesised changes in cloud cover (see Chapter
6). These mechanisms remain particularly uncertain and
currently are not incorporated in most efforts to simulate the

The representation of greenhouse gases and the effect of sulphate
aerosols has been improved in models. However, some of the
smaller forcings, including those due to biomass burning and
changes in land use, have not been taken into account in formal
detection studies. The major uncertainty in anthropogenic forcing
arises from the indirect effects of aerosols. The global mean
forcing is highly uncertain (Chapter 6, Figure 6.8). The estimated
forcing patterns vary from a predominantly Northern Hemisphere
forcing similar to that due to direct aerosol effects (Tett et al.,
2000) to a more globally uniform distribution, similar but
opposite in sign to that associated with changes in greenhouse
gases (Roeckner et al., 1999). If the response to indirect forcing
has a component which can be represented as a linear combina-
tion of the response to greenhouse gases and to the direct forcing
by aerosols, it will influence amplitudes of the responses to these
two factors estimated through optimal detection.

"Finally, there remains considerable uncertainty in the amplitude
and pattern of the climate response to changes in radiative forcing.
The large uncertainty in climate sensitivity, 1.5 to 4.5°C for a
doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide, has not been reduced
since the SAR, nor is it likely to be reduced in the near future by
the evidence provided by the surface temperature signal alone. In
contrast, the emerging signal provides a relatively strong
constraint on forecast transient climate change under some
emission scenarios. Some techniques can allow for errors in the
magnitude of the simulated global mean response in attribution
studies. As noted in Section 12.2, there is greater pattern similarity
between simulations of greenhouse gases alone, and of
greenhouse gases and aerosols using the same model, than
between simulations of the response to the same change in
greenhouse gases using different models. This leads to some
inconsistency in the estimation of the separate greenhouse gas and
aerosol components using different models (see Section 12.4.3).

The precise magnitude of natural internal climate variability
remains uncertain. The amplitude of internal variability in the
models most often used in detection studies differs by up to a
factor of two from that seen in the instrumental temperature
record on annual to decadal time-scales, with some models
showing similar or larger variability than observed (Section 12.2;
Chapter 8). However, the instrumental record is only marginally
useful for validating model estimates of variability on the multi-
decadal time-scales that are relevant for detection. Some palaeo-
climatic reconstructions of temperature suggest that multi-
decadal variability in the pre-industrial era was higher than that
generated internally by models (Section 12.2; Chapter 8).
However, apart from the difficulties inherent in reconstructing
temperature accurately from proxy data, the palaeoclimatic
record also includes the climatic response to natural forcings
arising, for example, from variations in solar output and volcanic
activity. Including the estimated forcing due to natural factors
increases the longer-term variability simulated by models, while
eliminating the response to external forcing from the palaeo-
record brings palaeo-variability estimates closer to model-based
estimates (Crowley, 2000).

natural forcing over the last two, and perhaps four, decades of the

not consistent with that observed)). Given that sulphate aerosol
forcing is negative, and hence tends to reduce the response,
detection of the response to the combined forcing indicates the
presence of a greenhouse gas signal that is at least as large as the
combined signal.

of an anthropogenic signal are insensitive to the model used to
estimate internal variability. Recent observed changes cannot be
accounted for as pure internal variability even if the amplitude of
simulated internal variations is increased by a factor of two or
more. It is therefore unlikely (bordering on very unlikely) that
natural internal variability alone can explain the changes in

The increase in volcanic activity during the past two to four
decades would, if anything, produce tropospheric cooling and
stratospheric warming, the reverse to what has occurred over this
period (e.g., Figure 12.8). Increases in solar irradiance could
account for some of the observed tropospheric warming, but
mechanisms by which this could cool the stratosphere (e.g.,
through changes in stratospheric ozone) remain speculative.
Observed increases in stratospheric water vapour might also
account for some of the observed stratospheric cooling.
Estimated changes in solar radiative forcing over the 20th century
are substantially smaller than those due to greenhouse gas
forcing, unless mechanisms exist which enhance the effects of
solar radiation changes at the ground. Palaeo-data show little

it is necessary to rule out the possibility that the detection
procedure has mistaken part or all of a natural signal for an
anthropogenic change. On physical grounds, natural forcing is
unlikely to account completely for the observed warming over
the last three to five decades, given that it is likely that the overall
trend in natural forcing over most of the 20th century is small or
negative. Several studies have involved three or more
components — the responses to greenhouse gases, sulphate
aerosols and natural (solar, volcanic or volcanic and solar)
forcing. These studies all detect a substantial greenhouse gas
contribution over the last fifty years, though in one case the
estimated greenhouse gas amplitude is inconsistent with observa-

in the amplitude of the response to natural forcing continues to

Over the last twenty years, the observed warming trend in the
lower troposphere has been smaller than at the surface. This
contrasts with model simulations of the response to anthro-
pogenic greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols. Natural climate
variability and the influence of natural external forcing, such as
volcanism, can explain part of this difference. However, a
discrepancy remains that cannot be accounted for with current
climate models. The reduced warming in the lower troposphere
does not, however, call into question the fact that the surface
temperature has been warming over the satellite period (e.g.,
National Academy of Sciences, 2000). Over the longer period for
which radiosonde data are available, an anthropogenic influence
due to increasing greenhouse gases and decreasing stratospheric
ozone is detected in all studies.

Most of the discussion in this section has been concerned with
evidence relating to a human effect on late 20th century climate.
The observed global mean surface temperature record shows two
main periods of warming. Some studies detect a solar influence
on surface temperature over the first five decades of the century,
with perhaps a small additional warming due to increases in
greenhouse gases. One study suggests that the early warming
could be due to a combination of anthropogenic effects and a
highly unusual internal variation. Thus the early century warming
could be due to some combination of natural internal variability,
changes in solar irradiance and some anthropogenic influence.
The additional warming in the second half-century is most likely
to be due to a substantial warming due to increases in greenhouse
gases, partially offset by cooling due to aerosols, and perhaps by
cooling due to natural factors towards the end of the period.

"allow for errors in the amplitude of the response, so the results
should not be sensitive to errors in the magnitude of the forcing or
the magnitude of the simulated model response. This would
reduce the impact of uncertainty in indirect sulphate forcing on the
estimated greenhouse and net sulphate signal amplitudes, to the
extent that the pattern of response to indirect sulphate forcing
resembles the pattern of response to direct sulphate forcing. Some
models indicate this is may be the case, others do not, so this
remains an important source of uncertainty. Note that if the spatio-
temporal pattern of response to indirect sulphate forcing were to
resemble the greenhouse response, it would lead to the amplitude
of the greenhouse response being underestimated in cases where
indirect sulphate forcing has not been included in the model.
Detection and attribution results are also expected to be insensitive
to all but the largest scale details of radiative forcing patterns.
Detection is only possible at the largest spatial scales (e.g., Stott
and Tett, 1998). In addition, atmospheric motions and large-scale
feedbacks smooth out the response. All these arguments tend to
reduce the impact of the large uncertainty in the magnitude of the
forcing due to indirect sulphate aerosols. The inclusion of forcing
from additional aerosols (see Chapter 6) is unlikely to alter our
conclusion concerning the detection of a substantial greenhouse
gas signal, though it is likely to affect estimates of the sulphate
aerosol response. This is because part of the response to sulphate
aerosols can be considered as surrogate for other aerosols, even
though the patterns of forcing and response may differ on smaller
scales. In general, the estimates of global mean forcing for other
neglected factors are small (see Chapter 6, Figure 6.6).

Berliner, 1999). Generalisations allow for the incorporation of
signal uncertainties (see, for example, Allen et al., 2000b). A
schematic two-dimensional example is given in Box 12.1. In
essence, the amplitudes are estimated by giving somewhat
greater weight to information in the low variance parts of the
field of observations. The uncertainty of this estimate,
expressed as the mxm covariance matrix of C,, of 4, is given

"where G=(g; |.../g,,,) is the matrix composed of the signal patterns
and a=(aj,...,a,,)’ is the vector composed of the unknown
amplitudes. The field usually contains temperature observations,
arrayed in space, either at the surface as grid box averages of
surface temperature observations (typically 5x5 degrees; Santer
et al., 1995; Hegerl et al., 1997; Tett et al., 1999), or in the
vertical as zonal averages of radiosonde observations (Karoly et
al., 1994; Santer et al., 1996a; Allen and Tett, 1999). The fields
are masked so that they represent only those regions with
adequate data. The fields may also have a time dimension (Allen
and Tett, 1999; North and Stevens; 1998; Stevens and North,
1996). Regardless of how the field is defined, its dimension n (the
total number of observed values contained in any one single
realisation of the field) is large. The signal patterns, which are
obtained from climate models, and the residual noise field, have
the same dimension. The procedure consists of efficiently
estimating the unknown amplitudes a from observations and
testing the null hypotheses that they are zero. In the event of
rejection, testing the hypothesis that the amplitudes are unity for
some combination of signals performs the attribution consistency
test. This assumes, of course, that the climate model signal
patterns have been normalised. When the signal is noise-free,
estimates of the amplitudes are given by

decadal mean temperature patterns. As with the fixed pattern
approach, a separate model is fitted for each 5-decade window
so that the evolution of the signal amplitudes can be studied.

"The space-time approach uses enlarged signal vectors that
consist of a sequence of spatial patterns representing the
evolution of the signal through a short epoch. For example, Tett
et al. (1999) use signal vectors composed of five spatial patterns
representing a sequence of decadal means. The enlarged signal
matrix G=G(t) evolves with time as the 5-decade window is
moved one decade at a time. The observations are defined

"where U is the nxn matrix with elements u;j=1/n. The matrix U
removes the spatial means. Note that area, mass or volume
weighting, as appropriate, is easily incorporated into these
expressions. The main point is that each statistic is proportional
to the inner product with respect to a matrix “kernel” between
the signal pattern and the observations (Stephenson, 1997). In
contrast with the pattern correlation statistics, the optimal signal
amplitude estimate, which is proportional to a correlation
coefficient using the so-called Mahalonobis kernel
(Stephenson, 1997), maximises the signal-to-noise ratio.
"	Text
"Fixed pattern studies (Hegerl et al., 1996, 1997, 2000a; Berliner
et al., 2000; Schnur, 2001) assume that the spatial structure of
the signals does not change during the epoch covered by the
instrumental record. This type of study searches for evidence
that the amplitudes of fixed anthropogenic signals are increasing
with time. The observed field y=y(r) that appears on the left hand
side of equation (A12.1.1) is typically a field of 30 to 50-year
moving window trends computed from annual mean observa-
tions. The regression equation (A12.1.1) is solved repeatedly
with a fixed signal matrix G as the moving 30 to 50-year
window is stepped through the available record.

"The pattern correlation methods discussed in this section are
closely related to optimal detection with one signal pattern.
Pattern correlation studies use either a centred statistic, R, which
correlates observed and signal anomalies in space relative to their
respective spatial means, or an uncentred statistic, C (Barnett and
Schlesinger, 1987), that correlates these fields without removing
the spatial means. It has been argued that the latter is better suited
for detection, because it includes the response in the global mean,
while the former is more appropriate for attribution because it
better measures the similarity between spatial patterns. The
similarity between the statistics is emphasised by the fact that
they can be given similar matrix-vector representations. In the
one pattern case, the optimal (regression) estimate of signal
amplitude is given by
"	Text
"The space-frequency approach (North et al., 1995) uses annual
mean signal patterns that evolve throughout the analysis period.
A Fourier transform is used to map the temporal variation of
each signal into the frequency domain. Only the low-frequency
Fourier coefficients representing decadal-scale variability are
retained and gathered into a signal vector. The observations are
similarly transformed. The selection of time-scales that is
effected by retaining only certain Fourier coefficients is a form
of dimension reduction (see Dimension Reduction, Appendix
12.4) in the time domain. This is coupled with spatial dimension
reduction that must also be performed. The result approximates
the dimension reduction that is obtained by projecting observa-
tions in space and time on low order space-time EOFs (North et
al., 1995). A further variation on this theme is obtained by
increasing the time resolution of the signals and the data by
using monthly rather than annual means. Climate statistics,
including means, variances and covariances, have annual cycles
at this time resolution, and thus dimension reduction must be
performed with cyclo-stationary space-time EOFs (Kim and Wu,
2000).

"Traditional statistical hypothesis tests are performed by
comparing the value of a detection statistic with an estimate of
its natural internal variability in the unperturbed climate. This
estimate must be obtained from control climate simulations
because detection statistics typically measure change on time-
scales that are a substantial fraction of the length of the
available instrumental record (see Appendix 12.4). Most
“optimal” detection studies use two data sets from control
climate simulations, one that is used to develop the optimal
detection statistic and the other to independently estimate its
natural variability. This is necessary to avoid underestimating
natural variability. The p-value that is used in testing the no
signal null hypothesis is often computed by assuming that both
the observed and simulated projections on signal patterns are
"	Text
"normally distributed. This is convenient, and is thought to be a
reasonable assumption given the variables and the time and
space scales used for detection and attribution. However, it
leads to concern that very small p-values may be unreliable,
because they correspond to events that have not been explored
by the model in the available control integrations (Allen and
Tett, 1999). They therefore recommend that p-values be
limited to values that are consistent with the range visited in
the available control integrations. A non-parametric approach
is to estimate the p-value by comparing the value of the
detection statistic with an empirical estimate of its distribution
obtained from the second control simulation data set. If
parametric methods are used to estimate the p-value, then very
small values should be reported as being less than 1/n, where
n, represents the equivalent number of independent real-
isations of the detection statistic that are contained in the
second control integration.
"	Text
"Estimation of the signal amplitudes, as well as the detection and
attribution consistency tests on the amplitudes, requires an
estimate of the covariance matrix Cy, of the residual noise field.
However, as y typically represents climate variation on time-
scales similar to the length of the observed instrumental record, it
is difficult to estimate the covariance matrix reliably. Thus the
covariance matrix is often estimated from a long control simula-
tion. Even so, the number of independent realisations of u that are
available from a typical 1,000 to 2,000-year control simulation is
substantially smaller than the dimension of the field, and thus it is
not possible to estimate the full covariance matrix. The solution is
to replace the full fields y, gj,....g,, and u with vectors of
dimension k, where m<k<<n, containing indices of their projec-
tions onto the dominant patterns of variability f),...,f,, of u. These
patterns are usually taken to be the k highest variance EOFs of a
control run (North and Stevens, 1998; Allen and Tett, 1999; Tett er
al., 1999) or a forced simulation (Hegerl er al., 1996, 1997;
Schnur, 2001). Stott and Tett (1998) showed with a “perfect
model” study that climate change in surface air temperature can
only be detected at very large spatial scales. Thus Tett et al. (1999)
reduce the spatial resolution to a few spherical harmonics prior to
EOF truncation. Kim et al. (1996) and Zwiers and Shen (1997)
examine the sampling properties of spherical harmonic coeffi-
cients when they are estimated from sparse observing networks.
"	Text
"An important decision, therefore, is the choice of k. A key consid-
eration in the choice is that the variability of the residuals should
be consistent with the variability of the control simulation in the
dimensions that are retained. Allen and Tett (1999) describe a
simple test on the residuals that makes this consistency check.
Rejection implies that the model-simulated variability is signifi-
cantly different from that of the residuals. This may happen when
the number of retained dimensions, k, is too large because higher
order EOFs may contain unrealistically low variance due to
sampling deficiencies or scales that are not well represented. In
this situation, the use of a smaller value of k can still provide
consistent results: there is no need to require that model-simulated
variability is perfect on all spatio-temporal scales for it to be
adequate on the very large scales used for detection and attribu-
tion studies. However, failing the residual check of Allen and Tett
(1999) could also indicate that the model does not have the
correct timing or pattern of response (in which case the residuals
will contain forced variability that is not present in the control
regardless of the choice of k) or that the model does not simulate
the correct amount of internal variability, even at the largest scales
represented by the low order EOFs. In this case, there is no
satisfactory choice of k. Previous authors (e.g., Hegerl et al.,
1996, 1997; Stevens and North, 1996; North and Stevens, 1998)
have made this choice subjectively. Nonetheless, experience in
recent studies (Tett et al. 1999; Hegerl et al. 2000, 2001; Stott et
al., 2001) indicates that their choices were appropriate.

Some extreme events are easily or implicitly incorporated in
climate scenarios using conventional techniques. It is more
difficult to produce scenarios of complex events, such as tropical

We also distinguish between a climate scenario and a climate

However, this term should strictly refer to a representation of the
difference between some plausible future climate and the current
or control climate (usually as represented in a climate model)
(see Box 13.1, Figure 13.1a). A climate change scenario can be
viewed as an interim step toward constructing a climate

from a climate projection (discussed in Chapters 9 and 10), which

The objective of this study was to estimate how global food supply might be affected by greenhouse gas induced climate change
up to the year 2060. The method adopted involved estimating the change in yield of major crop staples under various scenarios
using crop models at 112 representative sites distributed across the major agricultural regions of the world. Yield change estimates
were assumed to be applicable to large regions to produce estimates of changes in total production which were then input to a global
trade model. Using assumptions about future population, economic growth, trading conditions and technological progress, the trade
model estimated plausible prices of food commodities on the international market given supply as defined by the production
estimates. This information was then used to define the number of people at risk from hunger in developing countries.

Since projections of current (and hence future) regional climate from the GCM simulations were not accurate enough to be used
directly as an input to the crop model, modelled changes in climate were applied as adjustments to the observed climate at a
location. Climate change by 2060 was computed as the difference (air temperature) or ratio (precipitation and solar radiation) of
monthly mean climate between the GCM (unforced) control and 2xCO, simulations at GCM grid boxes coinciding with the crop
modelling sites (Figure 13.1b). These estimates were used to adjust observed time-series of daily climate for the baseline period
(usually 1961 to 1990) at each site (Figure 13.1b,c). Crop model simulations were conducted for the baseline climate and for each
of the three climate scenarios, with and without CO, enrichment (to estimate the relative contributions of CO, and climate to crop
yield changes), and assuming different levels of adaptation capacity.

conform to sets of circumstances or constraints within which they
occur (Hammond, 1996). The true purpose of scenarios is to

It is worth noting that the development of climate scenarios
predates the issue of global warming. In the mid-1970s, for

evaluate what the possible effects might be worldwide (CIAP,

ature (except in some isolated regions and physical circum-
stances), since most climatologists have very high confidence in
that characteristic (Schneider et al., 1990; Mahlman, 1997).
Given our present state of knowledge, a scenario that portrayed
global tropospheric cooling for the 21st century would not be
viable. We shall see in this chapter that what constitutes a viable
scenario of future climate has evolved along with our
understanding of the climate system and how this understanding
might develop in the future.

The chapter also serves as a bridge between this Report of
Working Group I and the IPCC Third Assessment Report of
Working Group II (IPCC, 2001) (hereafter TAR WG ID) of
climate change impacts, adaptation and vulnerability. As such it
also embodies the maturation in the IPCC assessment process —
that is, a recognition of the interconnections among the different
segments of the assessment process and a desire to further
integrate these segments. Chapter 3 performs a similar role in the
TAR WG II (Carter and La Rovere, 2001) also discussing climate
scenarios, but treating, in addition, all other scenarios (socio-
economic, land use, environmental, etc.) needed for undertaking
policy-relevant impact assessment. Chapter 3 serves in part as the
other half of the bridge between the two Working Group Reports.

As mentioned above, climate scenarios that are developed for
impacts applications usually require that some estimate of
climate change be combined with baseline observational climate
data, and the demand for more complete and sophisticated
observational data sets of climate has grown in recent years. The
important considerations for the baseline include the time period
adopted as well as the spatial and temporal resolution of the
baseline data.

"Four types of climate scenario that have been applied in impact
assessments are introduced in this section. The most common
scenario type is based on outputs from climate models and
receives most attention in this chapter. The other three types have
usually been applied with reference to or in conjunction with
model-based scenarios, namely: incremental scenarios for
sensitivity studies, analogue scenarios, and a general category of
“other scenarios”. The origins of these scenarios and their mutual
linkages are depicted in Figure 13.3.

various climate models to a given radiative forcing and the
method of constructing high resolution information from global
climate model outputs (Pittock, 1995; see Figure 13.2). For many
purposes, simply defining a single climate future is insufficient
and unsatisfactory. Multiple climate scenarios that address at
least one, or preferably several sources of uncertainty allow these
uncertainties to be quantified and explicitly accounted for in
impact assessments. Moreover, a further important requirement
for impact assessments is to ensure consistency is achieved
among various scenario components, such as between climate
change, sea level rise and the concentration of actual (as opposed
to equivalent) CO, implied by a particular emissions scenario.

The types of climate variables needed for quantitative
impacts studies vary widely (e.g., White, 1985). However, six
“cardinal” variables can be identified as the most commonly
requested: maximum and minimum temperature, precipitation,
incident solar radiation, relative humidity, and wind speed.
Nevertheless, this list is far from exhaustive. Other climate or
climate-related variables of importance may include CO,
concentration, sea-ice extent, mean sea level pressure, sea level,
and storm surge frequencies. A central issue regarding any
climate variable of importance for impact assessment is
determining at what spatial and temporal scales the variable in
question can sensibly be provided, in comparison to the scales
most desired by the impacts community. From an impacts
perspective, it is usually desirable to have a fair amount of
regional detail of future climate and to have a sense of how
climate variability (from short to long time-scales) may change.
But the need for this sort of detail is very much a function of the
scale and purpose of the particular impact assessment.
Moreover, the availability of the output from climate models and
the advisability of using climate model results at particular
scales, from the point of view of the climate modellers,
ultimately determines what scales can and should be used.

Palaeoclimatic analogues a are based on reconstructions of past
climate from fossil evidence, such as plant or animal remains and
sedimentary deposits. Two periods have received particular
attention (Budyko, 1989; Shabalova and Kénnen, 1995): the mid-
Holocene (about 5 to 6 ky BP?) and the Last (Eemian)
Interglacial (about 120 to 130 ky BP). During these periods,
mean global temperatures were as warm as or warmer than today
(see Chapter 2, Section 2.4.4), perhaps resembling temperatures
anticipated during the 21st century. Palaeoclimatic analogues
have been adopted extensively in the former Soviet Union (e.g.,
Frenzel et al., 1992; Velichko et al., 1995a,b; Anisimov and
Nelson, 1996), as well as elsewhere (e.g., Kellogg and Schware,
1981; Pittock and Salinger, 1982). The major disadvantage of
using palaeoclimatic analogues for climate scenarios is that the
causes of past changes in climate (e.g., variations in the Earth’s
orbit about the Sun; continental configuration) are different from

 
"	Text
"ee ee

Spatial analogues are regions which today have a climate
analogous to that anticipated in the study region in the future. For
example, to project future grass growth, Bergthérsson ef al.
(1988) used northern Britain as a spatial analogue for the
potential future climate over Iceland. Similarly, Kalkstein and
Greene (1997) used Atlanta as a spatial analogue of New York in
a heat/mortality study for the future. Spatial analogues have also
been exploited along altitudinal gradients to project vegetation
composition, snow conditions for skiing, and avalanche risk (e.g.,
Beniston and Price, 1992; Holten and Carey, 1992; Gyalistras et
al., 1997). However, the approach is severely restricted by the
frequent lack of correspondence between other important
features (both climatic and non-climatic) of a study region and its
spatial analogue (Arnell et al., 1990). Thus, spatial analogues are
seldom applied as scenarios, per se. Rather, they are valuable for
validating the extrapolation of impact models by providing
information on the response of systems to climatic conditions
falling outside the range currently experienced at a study
location.

Periods of observed global scale warmth during the historical
period have also been used as analogues of a greenhouse gas
induced warmer world (Wigley et al., 1980). Such scenarios are
usually constructed by estimating the difference between the
regional climate during the warm period and that of the long-term
average or a similarly selected cold period (e.g., Lough et al.,
1983). An alternative approach is to select the past period on the
basis not only of the observed climatic conditions but also of the
recorded impacts (e.g., Warrick, 1984; Williams et al., 1988;
Rosenberg er al., 1993; Lapin et al., 1995). A further method
employs observed atmospheric circulation patterns as analogues
(e.g., Wilby et al., 1994). The advantage of the analogue
approach is that the changes in climate were actually observed
and so, by definition, are internally consistent and physically
plausible. Moreover, the approach can yield useful insights into
past sensitivity and adaptation to climatic variations (Magalhaes
and Glantz, 1992). The major objection to these analogues is that
climate anomalies during the past century have been fairly minor
compared to anticipated future changes, and in many cases the
anomalies were probably associated with naturally occurring
changes in atmospheric circulation rather than changes in
greenhouse gas concentrations (e.g., Glantz, 1988; Pittock,
1989).

There are several limitations that restrict the usefulness of
AOGCM outputs for impact assessment: (i) the large resources
required to undertake GCM simulations and store their outputs,
which have restricted the range of experiments that can be
conducted (e.g., the range of radiative forcings assumed); (ii)
their coarse spatial resolution compared to the scale of many
impact assessments (see Section 13.4); (iii) the difficulty of
distinguishing an anthropogenic signal from the noise of natural
internal model variability (see Section 13.5); and (iv) the differ-
ence in climate sensitivity between models.
"	Text
"Three additional types of climate scenarios have also been adopted
in impact studies. The first type involves extrapolating ongoing
trends in climate that have been observed in some regions and that
appear to be consistent with model-based projections of climate
change (e.g., Jones et al., 1999). There are obvious dangers in
relying on extrapolated trends, and especially in assuming that
recent trends are due to anthropogenic forcing rather than natural
variability (see Chapters 2 and 12). However, if current trends in
climate are pointing strongly in one direction, it may be difficult to
defend the credibility of scenarios that posit a trend in the opposite
direction, especially over a short projection period.
"	Text
"The evolving (transient) pattern of climate response to
gradual changes in atmospheric composition was introduced into
climate scenarios using outputs from coupled AOGCMs from the
early 1990s onwards. Recent AOGCM simulations (see Chapter
9, Table 9.1) begin by modelling historical forcing by greenhouse
gases and aerosols from the late 19th or early 20th century
onwards. Climate scenarios based on these simulations are being
increasingly adopted in impact studies (e.g., Neilson et al., 1997;
Downing er al., 2000) along with scenarios based on ensemble
simulations (e.g., papers in Parry and Livermore, 1999) and
scenarios accounting for multi-decadal natural climatic
variability from long AOGCM control simulations (e.g., Hulme
et al., 1999a).

A third type of scenario is based on expert judgement,
whereby estimates of future climate change are solicited from
climate scientists, and the results are sampled to obtain
probability density functions of future change (NDU, 1978;
Morgan and Keith, 1995; Titus and Narayanan, 1996; Kuikka and
Varis, 1997; Tol and de Vos, 1998). The main criticism of expert
judgement is its inherent subjectivity, including problems of the
representativeness of the scientists sampled and likely biases in
questionnaire design and analysis of the responses (Stewart and
Glantz, 1985). Nevertheless, since uncertainties in estimates of
future climate are inevitable, any moves towards expressing
future climate in probabilistic terms will necessarily embrace
some elements of subjective judgement (see Section 13.5).

There may be climatological reasons to favour earlier baseline
periods over later ones (IPCC, 1994). For example, later periods
such as 1961 to 1990 are likely to have larger anthropogenic trends
embedded in the climate data, especially the effects of sulphate
aerosols over regions such as Europe and eastern USA (Karl et al.,
1996). In this regard, the “ideal” baseline period would be in the
19th century when anthropogenic effects on global climate were
negligible. Most impact assessments, however, seek to determine
the effect of climate change with respect to “the present”, and
therefore recent baseline periods such as 1961 to 1990 are usually
favoured. A further attraction of using 1961 to 1990 is that
observational climate data coverage and availability are generally
better for this period compared to earlier ones.

Simple climate models are simplified global models that attempt
to reproduce the large-scale behaviour of AOGCMs (see Chapter
9). While they are seldom able to represent the non-linearities of
some processes that are captured by more complex models, they
have the advantage that multiple simulations can be conducted
very rapidly, enabling an exploration of the climatic effects of
alternative scenarios of radiative forcing, climate sensitivity and
other parametrized uncertainties (IPCC, 1997). Outputs from
these models have been used in conjunction with GCM informa-
tion to develop scenarios using pattern-scaling techniques (see
Section 13.5). They have also been used to construct regional
greenhouse gas stabilisation scenarios (e.g., Gyalistras and
Fischlin, 1995). Simple climate models are used in climate
scenario generators (see Section 13.5.2) and in some integrated

development employ Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP)
reanalysis data products as a source of upper air climate data
(Kalnay et al., 1996). These reanalysis data sets extend over
periods up to 40 years and provide spatial and temporal resolution
sometimes lacking in observed climate data sets. Relatively little
detailed work has compared such reanalysis data with
independent observed data sets (see Santer et al., 1999, and

would be inappropriate to combine modelled changes in climate
calculated with respect to model year 1990 with an observed

would “disregard” about 0.15°C of mean global warming
occurring between the mid-1970s and 1990. It would be equally
misleading to apply modelled changes in climate calculated with
respect to an unforced (control) climate representing “pre-
industrial” conditions (e.g., “forced” t; minus “unforced” t, in

unwarranted amount of global climate change into the scenario.
This latter definition of modelled climate change was originally
used in transient climate change experiments to overcome
problems associated with climate “drift” in the coupled AOGCM
simulations (Cubasch er al., 1992), but was not designed to be
used in conjunction with observed climate data. It is more
appropriate to define the modelled change in climate with respect
to the same baseline period that the observed climate data set is
representing (e.g., “forced” t; minus “forced” t, in Figure 13.4,
added to a 1961 to 1990 baseline climate).

Conventionally, regional “detail” in climate scenarios has been
incorporated by applying changes in climate from the coarse-scale
GCM grid points to observation points that are distributed at
varying resolutions, but often at resolutions higher than that of the
GCMs (e.g., see Box 13.1; Whetton et al., 1996; Arnell, 1999).
Recently, high resolution gridded baseline climatologies have
been developed with which coarse resolution GCM results have
been combined (e.g., Saarikko and Carter, 1996; Kittel ef al.,
1997). Such relatively simple techniques, however, cannot
overcome the limitations imposed by the fundamental spatial
coarseness of the simulated climate change information itself.

The scale at which information can appropriately be taken
from relatively coarse-scale GCMs has also been debated. For
example, many climate scenarios constructed from GCM outputs
have taken information from individual GCM grid boxes,
whereas most climate modellers do not consider the outputs from
their simulation experiments to be valid on a single grid box scale
and usually examine the regional results from GCMs over a
cluster of grid boxes (see Chapter 10, Section 10.3). Thus, the
scale of information taken from coarse resolution GCMs for
scenario development often exceeds the reasonable resolution of

accuracy of the models themselves.

The basic strategy in regional modelling is to rely on the GCM to

reproduce the large-scale circulation of the atmosphere and for
the regional model to simulate sub-GCM scale regional distribu-
tions or patterns of climate, such as precipitation, temperature,
and winds, over the region of interest (Giorgi and Mearns, 1991;
McGregor, 1997; Giorgi and Mearns, 1999). The GCM provides
the initial and lateral boundary conditions for driving the regional
climate model (RCM). In general, the spatial resolution of the
regional model is on the order of tens of kiilometres, whereas the
GCM scale is an order of magnitude coarser. Further details on
the techniques of regional climate modelling are covered in

"climate can be calculated either as the difference or as the ratio
between the simulated future climate and the simulated baseline
climate. These differences or ratios are then applied to the
observed baseline climate — whether mean values, monthly or a
daily time-series. Differences are commonly applied to tempera-
ture (as in Box 13.1), while ratios are usually used with those
surface variables, such as precipitation, vapour pressure and
radiation, that are either positive or zero. Climate scenarios have
been constructed using both absolute and relative changes for
precipitation. The effects of the two different approaches on the
resulting climate change impacts depend on the types of impacts
being studied and the region of application. Some studies report
noticeable differences in impacts (e.g., Alcamo ef al., 1998),
especially since applying ratio changes alters the standard
deviation of the original series (Mearns et al., 1996); in others,
differences in impacts were negligible (e.g., Torn and Fried,

Three major techniques (referred to as regionalisation
techniques) have been developed to produce higher resolution
climate scenarios: (1) regional climate modelling (Giorgi and
Mearns, 1991; McGregor, 1997; Giorgi and Mearns, 1999); (2)
statistical downscaling (Wilby and Wigley, 1997; Murphy, 1999);
and (3) high resolution and variable resolution Atmospheric
General Circulation Model (AGCM) time-slice techniques
(Cubasch et al., 1995; Fox-Rabinovitz et al., 1997). The two
former methods are dependent on the large-scale circulation
variables from GCMs, and their value as a viable means of
increasing the spatial resolution of climate change information
thus partially depends on the quality of the GCM simulations.
The variable resolution and high resolution time-slice methods
use the AGCMs directly, run at high or variable resolutions. The
high resolution time-slice technique is also dependent on the sea
surface temperature simulated by a coarser resolution AOGCM.
There have been few completed experiments using these AGCM
techniques, which essentially are still under development (see
Chapter 10, Section 10.4). Moreover, they have rarely been
applied to explicit scenario formation for impacts purposes (see
Jendritzky and Tinz, 2000, for an exception) and are not
discussed further in this chapter. See Chapter 10 for further
details on all techniques.

determining whether the high resolution scenario actually

the high resolution scenario was partially derived. This aspect

climate scenarios because: (1) less faith has been placed in climate
model simulations of changes in variability than of changes in

complex than those for incorporating mean changes; and (3) there
may have been a perception that changes in means are more
important for impacts than changes in variability (Mearns, 1995).

In statistical downscaling, a cross-scale statistical relationship
is developed between large-scale variables of observed climate

vorticity, and local variables such as site-specific temperature
and precipitation (von Storch, 1995; Wilby and Wigley, 1997;
Murphy, 1999). These relationships are assumed to remain
constant in the climate change context. Also, it is assumed that
the predictors selected (i.e., the large-scale variables)
adequately represent the climate change signal for the predic-
tand (e.g., local-scale precipitation). The statistical relationship
is used in conjunction with the change in the large-scale
variables to determine the future local climate. Further details

While the two major techniques described above have been
available for about ten years, and proponents claim use in
impact assessments as one of their important applications, it is
only quite recently that scenarios developed using these
techniques have actually been applied in a variety of impact
assessments, such as temperature extremes (Hennessy et al.,
1998; Mearns, 1999); water resources (Hassall and Associates,
1998; Hay et al., 1999; Wang et al., 1999; Wilby et al., 1999;
Stone et al., 2001); agriculture (Mearns er al., 1998, 1999,
2000a, 2001; Brown et al., 2000) and forest fires (Wotton et
al., 1998). Prior to the past couple of years, these techniques
were mainly used in pilot studies focused on increasing the
temporal (and spatial) scale of scenarios (e.g., Mearns et al.,
1997; Semenov and Barrow, , 1997). |

The conventional method of constructing mean change
scenarios for precipitation using the ratio method (discussed in
Section 13.3) results in a change in variability of daily precipita-
tion intensity; that is, the variance of the intensity is changed by a
factor of the square of the ratio (Mearns et al., 1996). However, the
frequency of precipitation is not changed. Using the difference
method (as is common for temperature variables) the variance of
the time-series is not changed. Hence, from the perspective of
variability, application of the difference approach to precipitation
produces a more straightforward scenario. However, it can also
result in negative values of precipitation. Essentially neither
approach is realistic in its effect on the daily characteristics of the
time-series. As mean (monthly) precipitation changes, both the
daily intensity and frequency are usually affected.

~ Application of high ‘resolution scenarios 9s produced from a
regional model (Giorgi er al., 1998) over the Central Plains of
the USA produced changes in simulated crop yields that were
significantly different from those changes calculated from a
coarser resolution GCM scenario (Mearns et al., 1998; 1999,
2001). For simulated corn in Iowa, for example, the large-scale
(GCM) scenario resulted in a statistically significant decrease
in yield, but the high resolution scenario produced an insignif-
icant increase (Figure 13.5). Substantial differences in regional
economic impacts based on GCM and RCM scenarios were
also found in a recent integrated assessment of agriculture in
the south-eastern USA (Mearns ef al., 2000a,b). Hay et al.
(1999), using a regression-based statistical downscaling
technique, developed downscaled scenarios based on the
Hadley Centre Coupled AOGCM (HadCM2) transient runs and
applied them to a hydrologic model in three river basins in the
USA. They found that the standard scenario from the GCM
produced changes in surface runoff that were quite different
from those produced from the downscaled scenario (Figure

"The climate change information most commonly taken from
climate modelling experiments comprises mean monthly,
seasonal, or annual changes in variables of importance to impact
assessments. However, changes in climate will involve changes in
variability as well as mean conditions. As mentioned in Section
13.3 on baseline climate, the interannual variability in climate
scenarios constructed from mean changes in climate is most
commonly inherited from the baseline climate, not from the
climate change experiment. Yet, it is known that changes in
variability could be very important to most areas of impact assess-
ment (Mearns, 1995; Semenov and Porter, 1995). The most
obvious way in which variability changes affect resource systems
is through the effect of variability change on the frequency of
extreme events. As Katz and Brown (1992) demonstrated,
changes in standard deviation have a proportionately greater effect
than changes in means on changes in the frequency of extremes.
However, from a climate scenario point of view, it is the relative
size of the change in the mean versus standard deviation of a
variable that determines the final relative contribution of these
statistical moments to a change in extremes. The construction of
scenarios incorporating extremes is discussed in Section 13.4.2.2.

The major, most complete technique for producing scenarios
with changes in interannual and daily variability involves manipu-

in Section 13.3.2). These are commonly based either on a Markov
chain approach (e.g., Richardson, 1981) or a spell length approach
(e.g., Racksko et al., 1991), and simulate changes in variability on

Another approach is to calculate the change in ‘modelled
interannual variability between the baseline and future periods,
and then to apply it as an inflator or deflator to the observed
baseline interannual variability. In this way, modelled changes in
interannual variability are carried forward into the climate
scenario, but the observed baseline climate still provides the initial
definition of variability. This approach was initially developed in
Mearns et al. (1992) and has recently been experimented with by
Arnell (1999). However, this approach can produce unrealistic
features, such as negative precipitation or inaccurate autocorrela-
tion structure of temperature, when applied to climate data on a
daily time-scale (Mearns et al., 1996).

In recent years, more robust and physically meaningful
changes in climatic variability on daily to interannual time scales
have been found in runs of GCMs and RCMs for some regions
(e.g., Gregory and Mitchell, 1995; Mearns et al., 1995a,b;
Whetton ef al., 1998a; Mearns, 1999; Boer et al., 2000). For
example, on both daily and interannual time-scales many models
simulate temperature variability decreases in winter and increases
in summer in northern mid-latitude land areas (see Chapter 9,
Section 9.3). This result is likely to encourage the further applica-
tion of model-derived variability changes in climate scenario

construction.

daily to interannual variability of climate: the marginality of the
current climate for crop growth, the relative size of the mean and
variance changes, and the timing of these changes.

It is difficult to generalise the importance of changes in
variability to climate change impacts since significance of
changes in variability is region, variable, and resource system
specific. For example, based on results of equilibrium control and
2xCO, experiments of DARLAM (a regional model developed in
Australia) nested within the CSIRO climate model over New
South Wales, Whetton et al. (1998a) emphasised that most of the
change in temperature extremes they calculated resulted from
changes in the mean, not through change in the daily variance. In
contrast, Mearns (1999) found large changes (e.g., decreases in
winter) in daily variance of temperature in control and 2xCO,
experiments with a regional climate model (RegCM2) over the
Great Plains of the U.S. (Giorgi et al., 1998). These changes were
sufficient to make a significant difference in the frequency of daily

Where ENSO signals are strong, weather generators can be
successfully conditioned on ENSO phases; and therein lies the
potential for creating scenarios with changes in the frequency of
ENSO events. By conditioning on the phases, either discretely
(Wang and Connor, 1996) or continuously (Woolhiser ef al.,
1993), a model can be formed for incorporating changes in the
frequency and persistence of such events, which would then
induce changes in the daily (and interannual) variability of the
local climate sites. Weather generators can also be successfully
conditioned using NAO signals (e.g., Wilby, 1998). However, it
must be noted that there remains much uncertainty in how events
such as ENSO might change with climate change (Knutson, et al.,
1997; Timmerman ef al., 1999; Walsh et al., 1999; see also
Chapter 9, Section 9.3.5, for further discussion on possible
changes in ENSO events). While there is great potential for the use
of conditioned stochastic models in creating scenarios of changed
variability, to date, no such scenario has actually been applied to
an impact model.

In the case of extremes that are not represented at all in
climate models, secondary variables may sometimes be used to
derive them. For example, freezing rain, which results in ice
storms, is not represented in climate models, but frequencies of
daily minimum temperatures on wet days might serve as useful
surrogate variables (Konrad, 1998).

Even when presented with a given greenhouse gas concentration
scenario, there are considerable uncertainties in the radiative
forcing changes, especially aerosol forcing, associated with
changes in atmospheric concentrations. These uncertainties are

resented in climate scenarios.

"13.5.1.2. Uncertainties in converting emissions to concentrations
It is uncertain how a given emissions path converts into
atmospheric concentrations of the various radiatively active gases
or aerosols. This is because of uncertainties in processes relating
to the carbon cycle, to atmospheric trace gas chemistry and to
aerosol physics (see Chapters 3, 4 and 5). For these uncertainties
to be reflected in climate scenarios that rely solely on GCM
outputs, AOGCMs that explicitly simulate the various gas cycles
and aerosol physics are needed. At present, however, they are
seldom, if ever, represented in climate scenarios.

"The ability of climate models to adequately represent
extremes partially depends on their spatial resolution (Skelly
and Henderson-Sellers, 1996; Osborn, 1997; Mearns, 1999).
This is particularly true for complex atmospheric phenomena
such as hurricanes (see Chapter 10, Box 10.2). There is some
very limited information on possible changes in the frequency
and intensity of tropical cyclones (Bengtsson er al., 1996;
Henderson-Sellers et al., 1998; Krishnamurti et al., 1998;
Knutson and Tuleya, 1999; Walsh and Ryan, 2000); and of
mid-latitude cyclones (Schubert et al., 1998), but these studies

In previous IPCC Assessments, a small number of future
greenhouse gas and aerosol precursor emissions scenarios have
been presented (e.g., Leggett et al., 1992). In the current
Assessment, a larger number of emissions scenarios have been
constructed in the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES)
(Nakicenovié et al., 2000), and the uncertain nature of these
emissions paths have been well documented (Morita and
Robinson, 2001). Climate scenarios constructed from equilibrium
GCM experiments alone (e.g., Howe and Henderson-Sellers,
1997; Smith and Pitts, 1997) do not consider this uncertainty, but
some assumption about the driving emissions scenario is required
if climate scenarios are to describe the climate at one or more
specified times in the future. This source of uncertainty is quite
often represented in climate scenarios (e.g., Section 13.5.2.1).

An example of an attempt to incorporate such complex
changes into climate scenarios is the study of McInnes et al.
(2000), who developed an empirical/dynamical model that
gives return period versus height for tropical cyclone-related
storm surges for Cairns on the north Australian coast. To
determine changes in the characteristics of cyclone intensity,
they prepared a climatology of tropical cyclones based on data
drawn from a much larger area than Cairns locally. They
incorporated the effect of climate change by modifying the
parameters of the Gumbel distribution of cyclone intensity
based on increases in tropical cyclone intensity derived from
climate model results over a broad region characteristic of the
location in question. Estimates of sea level rise also
contributed to the modelled changes in surge height. Other new
techniques for incorporating such complex changes into
quantitative climate scenarios are yet to be developed.

"Uncertainties about future climate arise from a number of
different sources (see Figure 13.2) and are discussed
extensively throughout this volume. Depending on the climate
scenario construction method, some of these uncertainties will
be explicitly represented in the resulting scenario(s), while
others will be ignored (Jones, 2000a). For example, scenarios
that rely on the results from GCM experiments alone may be
able to represent some of the uncertainties that relate to the
modelling of the climate response to a given radiative forcing,
but might not embrace uncertainties caused by the modelling of
atmospheric composition for a given emissions scenario, or
those related to future land-use change. Section 13.5.2 therefore
assesses different approaches for representing uncertainties in
climate scenarios. First, however, five key sources of
uncertainty, as they relate to climate scenario construction, are
very briefly described. Readers are referred to the relevant

An additional set of modelling uncertainties is introduced into

climate scenarios through differences in the global and regional
climate responses simulated by different AOGCMs for the same
forcing. Different models have different climate sensitivities (see
Chapter 9, Section 9.3.4.1), and this remains a key source of
uncertainty for climate scenario construction. Also important is
the fact that different GCMs yield different regional climate
change patterns, even for similar magnitudes of global warming
(see Chapter 10). Furthermore, each AOGCM simulation includes
not only the response (i.e., the “‘signal”’) to a specified forcing, but
also an unpredictable component (i.e., the “noise”) that is due to
internal climate variability. This latter may itself be an imperfect
replica of true climate variability (see Chapter 8). A fourth source
of uncertainty concerns important processes that are missing from
most model simulations. For instance AOGCM-based climate
scenarios do not usually allow for the effect on climate of future
land use and land cover change (which is itself, in part, climati-
cally induced). Although the first two sources of model

Pattern-scaling methods allow a wider range of possible future

emissions scenarios) and climate sensitivities (e.g., the 1.5°C to
4.5°C IPCC range) to be represented in climate scenarios than if
only the direct results from GCM experiments were used. The
approach involves normalising GCM response patterns according
to the global mean temperature change (although in some cases
zonal mean temperature changes have been used). These
normalised patterns are then rescaled using a scalar derived from
simple climate models and representing the particular scenario
under consideration.

"This pattern-scaling method was first suggested by Santer et
al. (1990) and was employed in the IPCC First Assessment Report
to generate climate scenarios for the year 2030 (Mitchell et al.,
1990) using patterns from 2xCO, GCM experiments. It has
subsequently been widely adopted in climate scenario generators
(CSGs), for example in ESCAPE (Rotmans ef al., 1994),
IMAGE-2 (Alcamo et al., 1994), SCENGEN (Hulme er al.,
1995a,b), SILMUSCEN (Carter et al., 1995, 1996a), COSMIC

A climate scenario generator is an integrated suite of simple
models that takes emissions or forcing scenarios as inputs and
generates geographically distributed climate scenarios combining
response patterns of different greenhouse gases from GCMs with
observational climate data. CSGs allow multiple sources of
uncertainty to be easily represented in the calculated scenarios,

Most climate scenario construction methods combine model-
based estimates of climate change with observed climate data
(Section 13.3). Further uncertainties are therefore introduced into
a climate scenario because observed data sets seldom capture the
full range of natural decadal-scale climate variability, because of
errors in gridded regional or global baseline climate data sets, and
because different methods are used to combine model and
observed climate data. These uncertainties relating to the use of
observed climate data are usually ignored in climate scenarios.
Furthermore, regionalisation techniques that make use of informa-
tion from AOGCM and RCM experiments to enhance spatial and
temporal scales introduce additional uncertainties into regional
climate scenarios (their various advantages and diasdvantages are
assessed in Chapter 10 and in Section 13.4). These uncertainties
could be quantified by employing a range of regionalisation
techniques, but this is rarely done.

Two fundamental assumptions of pattern- scaling are, first, that

the defined GCM response patterns adequately depict the climate
“signal” under anthropogenic forcing (see Section 13.5.2.2) and,
second, that these response patterns are representative across a
wide range of possible anthropogenic forcings. These assumptions
have been explored by Mitchell et al. (1999) who examined the
effect of scaling decadal, ensemble mean temperature and precip-
itation patterns in the suite of HadCM2 experiments. Although
their response patterns were defined using only 10-year means,
using four-member ensemble means improved the performance of
the technique when applied to reconstructing climate response
patterns in AOGCM experiments forced with alternative scenarios
(see Figure 13.7). This confirmed earlier work by Oglesby and

ture response patterns derived from equilibrium GCMs were fairly
uniform over a wide range of concentrations, scaling linearly with
global mean temperature. The main exception occurred in the

"There are different approaches for representing each of the above
five generic sources of uncertainty when constructing climate
scenarios. The cascade of uncertainties, and the options for
representing them at each of the five stages, can result in a wide
range of climate outcomes in the finally constructed scenarios
(Henderson-Sellers, 1996; Wigley, 1999; Visser et al., 2000).
Choices are most commonly made at the stage of modelling the
climate response to a given forcing, where it is common for a set
of climate scenarios to include results from different GCMs. In
practice, this sequential and conditional approach to representing
uncertainty in climate scenarios has at least one severe limitation:
at each stage of the cascade, only a limited number of the
conditional outcomes have been explicitly modelled. For
example, GCM experiments have used one, or only a small
number, of the concentration scenarios that are plausible (for
example, most transient AOGCM experiments that have been
used for climate scenarios adopted by impacts assessments have
been forced with a scenario of a 1% per annum growth in
greenhouse gas concentration). Similarly, regionalisation
techniques have been used with only a small number of the GCM
experiments that have been conducted. These limitations restrict
the choices that can be made in climate scenario construction and
mean that climate scenarios do not fully represent the uncertain-
ties inherent in climate prediction.

The question of signal-to-noise ratios in climate model simula-

Chapters 9 and 12. The treatment of “signal” and “noise” in
constructing climate scenarios is of great importance in
interpreting the results of impact assessments that make use of
these scenarios. If climate scenarios contain an unspecified
combination of signal plus noise, then it is important to recognise
that the impact response to such scenarios will only partly be a
response to anthropogenic climate change; an unspecified part of
the impact response will be related to natural internal climate
variability. However, if the objective is to specify the impacts of
the anthropogenic climate signal alone, then there are two possible
strategies for climate scenario construction:

"The relative strength of the signal-to-noise ratio can be
demonstrated in a number of ways. Where response patterns are
reasonably stable over time, this ratio can be maximised in a
climate change scenario by using long (30-year or more)
averaging periods. Alternatively, regression or principal
component techniques may be used to extract the signal from the
model response (Hennessy ef al., 1998). A third technique is to
use results from multi-member ensemble simulations, as first
performed by Cubasch er al. (1994). Sampling theory shows that
in such simulations the noise is reduced by a factor of \(n), where
n is the ensemble size. Using results from the HadCM2 four-

case of surface air temperature and in cases where the response

of sulphate aerosol forcing, regionally differentiated response
patterns and scalars must be defined and signal-to-noise ratios
should be quantified. It must be remembered, however, that while
these techniques are a convenient way of handling several types of

Two situations where the pattern-scaling techniques may
need more cautious application are in the cases of stabilisation
forcing scenarios and heterogenous aerosol forcing. Whetton et
al. (1998b) have shown that for parts of the Southern
Hemisphere a highly non-linear regional rainfall response was
demonstrated in an AOGCM forced with a stabilisation scenario,
a response that could not easily be handled using a linear
pattern-scaling technique. In the case of heterogeneous forcing,
similar global mean warmings can be associated with quite
different regional patterns, depending on the magnitude and
pattern of the aerosol forcing. Pattern-scaling using single global
scalars is unlikely to work in such cases. There is some evidence,
however, to suggest that separate greenhouse gas and aerosol
response patterns can be assumed to be additive (Ramaswamy
and Chen, 1997) and pattern-scaling methods have subsequently
been adapted by Schlesinger et al. (1997, 2000) for the case of
heterogeneously forced scenarios. This is an area, however,
where poor signal-to-noise ratios hamper the application of the
technique and caution is advised.

A different way of maximising ‘the climate change signal is to
compare the responses of single realisations from experiments
completed using different models. If the error for different models

model average will yield a better estimate of the signal than any

ideal. Observed climate data may often be of short duration and
therefore yield a biased estimate of the noise. Multi-decadal

probabilities of all climates below a given level of annual exceedance of
annual water supply; e.g., 50%, or exceedance of the annual water limit
in at least one of every two years. (Source: Jones, 2000b.)

"Uncertainty analysis is required to perform quantitative risk or
decision analysis (see Toth and Mwandosya (2001) for discus-
sion of decision analysis). By itself, scenario analysis is not
equivalent to uncertainty analysis because not all possible
scenarios are necessarily treated and, especially, because
probabilities are not attached to each scenario (see Morgan and
Henrion (1990) for a general treatment of uncertainty analysis;
see Katz (2000) for a more recent overview focusing on climate
change). Recognising this limitation, a few recent studies (Jones,
2000b; New and Hulme, 2000) have attempted to modify climate
scenario analysis, grouping a range of scenarios together and
attaching a probability to the resultant classes. Such an approach
can be viewed as a first step in bridging the gap between scenario
and uncertainty analysis. Single climate scenarios, by definition,
are limited to plausibility with no degree of likelihood attached.
Since risk analysis requires that probabilities be attached to each
climate scenario, subjective probabilities can be applied to the
input parameters that determine the climate outcomes (e.g.,
emissions scenarios, the climate sensitivity, regional climate
response patterns), thus allowing distributions of outcomes to be
formally quantified.

"In formal risk analysis, the extremes of the probability distri-
bution should encompass the full range of possible outcomes,
although in climate change studies this remains hard to achieve.
The ranges for global warming and sea level rise from the IPCC
WGI Second Assessment Report (IPCC, 1996) (hereafter SAR),
for example, deliberately did not encompass the full range of
possible outcomes and made no reference to probability distribu-
tions. As a consequence, the bulk of impact assessments have
treated these IPCC ranges as having a uniform probability, i.e.,
acting as if no information is available about what changes are
more likely than others. As pointed out by Titus and Narayanan
(1996), Jones (1998, 2000a), and Parkinson and Young (1998),
however, where several sources of uncertainty are combined, the
resulting probability distribution is not uniform but is a function
of the component probability distributions and the relationship
between the component elements. For example, descriptions of
regional changes in temperature and rainfall over Australia
constructed from regional response patterns have been used in a
number of hydrological studies where the extreme outcomes
have been considered as likely as outcomes in the centre of the
range (e.g., Chiew ef al., 1995; Schreider et al., 1996; Whetton,
1998). However, when the two component ranges — global
warming and normalised local temperature and rainfall change —
are randomly sampled and then multiplied together, they offer a
distinctly non-uniform distribution (see Figure 13.9a). Further
refinements of these approaches for quantifying the risk of
climate change are needed (New and Hulme, 2000).

This approach to GCM selection, however, raises a number of
questions. Over which geographic domain should the GCM be
evaluated — the global domain or only over the region of study?
Which climate variables should be evaluated — upper air synoptic
features that largely control the surface climate, or only those
climate variables, mostly surface, that are used in impact studies?

Even if quantifiable uncertainties are represented, further
uncertainties in climate scenarios may still need to be
documented or explicitly treated. These include the possible
impact on scenarios of errors in the unforced model simulation,
the possibility that current models cannot adequately simulate the
enhanced greenhouse response of a climatic feature of interest, or
inconsistencies between results of model simulations and
emerging observed climatic trends. For these reasons climate
scenarios are often annotated with a list of caveats, along with
some assessment as to their importance for the scenario user.

The climate system consists of several components that
interact with and influence each other at many different temporal
and spatial scales (see Chapter 7). This complexity adds further
constraints to the development of climate scenarios, though their
relevance is strongly dependent on the objectives and scope of the
studies that require scenarios. Most climate scenarios are based
on readily available climate variables (e.g., from AOGCMs) and,
where these are used in impact assessments, studies are often
restricted to an analysis of the effects of changes in climate alone.
However, other related environmental aspects may also change,
and these are often neglected or inadequately represented, thus

"This section discusses some of the caveats of climate scenario
development and focuses on the need for consistency in
representing different physical aspects of the climate system. It
does not discuss the many possible inconsistencies with respect
to socio-economic issues in scenario development. Chapter 3 of
the TAR WG II (Carter and La Rovere, 2001) and Chapter 2 of
the TAR WG III (Morita and Robinson, 2001) provide a detailed
treatment of these issues. Three common inconsistencies in
applying climate scenarios are discussed, concerning the
representation of ambient versus equivalent CO, concentrations,
biosphere-ocean-atmosphere interactions and time lags between
sea level rise and temperature change.

"more faithfully than earlier GCMs (Kittel et al., 1998; see also
Chapter 8), but they still show large errors in simulating inter-
annual climate variability in some regions (Giorgi and Francisco,
2000; Lal et al., 2000) and in replicating ENSO-like behaviour in
the tropics (Knutson ef al., 1997). These questions demonstrate
that there is no easy formula to apply when choosing GCMs for
climate scenario construction; there will always be a role for
informed but, ultimately, individual judgement. This judgement,
however, should be made not just on empirical grounds (for
example, which model’s present climate correlates best with
observations) but also on the basis of understanding the reasons
for good or bad model performance, particularly if those reasons
are important for the particular scenario application.

"This approach to portraying uncertainty has potentially useful
applications when combined with climate impact sensitivity
response surfaces (see Section 13.2.1; see also Chapter 3 of TAR
WG IL (Carter and La Rovere, 2001)). The superimposed
response surfaces allow the calculation of probabilities for
exceeding particular impact thresholds (Figure 13.9b). Another
method of assessing risk using quantified probability distribu-
tions is through a series of linked models such as those used for
calculating sea level rise (Titus and Narayanan, 1996) and
economic damage due to sea level rise (Yohe and Schlesinger,
1998), for quantifying climate uncertainty (Visser er al., 2000),
and in integrated assessments (Morgan and Dowlatabadi, 1996).
Efforts to make explicit probabilistic forecasts of the climate
response to a given emissions scenario for the near future have
been made using the current observed climate trajectory to
constrain the “forecasts” from several GCMs (Allen et al., 2000).
More details on this technique are given in Section 12.4.3.3.

" 

Several examples of such annotations can be given. Lal and
Giorgi (1997) suggested that GCMs that cannot simulate the
observed interannual variability of the Indian monsoon correctly
should not be used as the basis for climate scenarios. Giorgi et al.
(1998) commented that model-simulated spring temperatures over
the USA Central Plains were too cold in both the CSIRO GCM
and in the CSIRO-driven RegCM2 control simulations and
affected the credibility of the ensuing temperature climate
scenarios. Finally, scenarios prepared for the Australian region
have often been accompanied by the note that ENSO is an
important component of Australian climate that may change in the
future, but that is not yet adequately simulated in climate models
(e.g., Hennessy et al., 1998). Expert judgment can also be used to
place confidence estimates on scenario ranges (Morgan and Keith,
1995). For example, Jones ef al. (2000) placed “high confidence”
on the temperature scenarios (incorporating quantifiable
uncertainty) prepared for the South Pacific, but only “moderate to
low confidence” in the corresponding rainfall scenarios.

When choosing which GCM(s) to use as the basis for climate
scenario construction, one of the criteria that has often been used
is the ability of the GCM to simulate present day climate. Many
climate scenarios have used this criterion to assist in their choice
of GCM, arguing that GCMs that simulate present climate more
faithfully are likely to simulate more plausible future climates
(e.g., Whetton and Pittock, 1991; Robock er al., 1993; Risbey and
Stone, 1996; Gyalistras et al., 1997; Smith and Pitts, 1997; Smith
and Hulme, 1998; Lal and Harasawa, 2000). A good simulation
of present day climate, however, is neither a necessary nor a
sufficient condition for accurate simulation of climate change
(see Chapter 8). It is possible, for example, that a model with a
poor simulation of present day climate could provide a more
accurate simulation of climate change than one which has a good
simulation of present climate, if it contains a better representation
of the dominant feedback processes that will be initiated by
radiative forcing. While such uncertainties are difficult to test,
useful insights into the ability of models to simulate long-term
climate change can also be obtained by comparing model simula-
tions of the climate response to past changes in radiative forcing
against reconstructed paleoclimates.

Another i important input to impact assessments is sea level rise.
AOGCMs usually calculate the thermal expansion of the oceans
directly, but this is only one component of sea level rise (see
Chapter 11). Complete calculations of sea level rise, including
changes in the mass balance of ice sheets and glaciers, can be
made with simpler models (e.g., Raper et al., 1996), and the
transient dynamics of sea level rise should be explicitly calculated
because the responses are delayed (Warrick et al., 1996). However,
the current decoupling of important dynamic processes in most
simple models could generate undesirable inaccuracies in the
resulting scenarios.

The biosphere is is an important control in defining changes in
greenhouse gas concentrations. Its surface characteristics, such as
albedo and surface roughness, further influence climate patterns.
Biospheric processes, such as CO,-sequestration and release,
evapotranspiration and land-cover change, are in turn affected by
climate. For example, warming is expected to result in a poleward
expansion of forests (IPCC, 1996b). This would increase
biospheric carbon storage, which lowers future CO, concentra-
tions and change the surface albedo which would directly affect
climate. A detailed discussion of the role of the biosphere on
climate can be found elsewhere (Chapters 3 and 7), but there is a
clear need for an improved treatment of biospheric responses in
scenarios that are designed for regional impact assessment. Some
integrated assessment models, which include simplifications of
many key biospheric responses, are beginning to provide consis-
tent information of this kind (e.g., Alcamo ef al., 1996, 1998;
Harvey et al., 1997; Xiao et al., 1997; Goudriaan et al., 1999).

"Concurrent changes in atmospheric concentrations of gases
such as CO , sulphur dioxide (SO) and ozone (O3) can have
important effects on biological systems. Studies of the response of
biotic systems require climate scenarios that include consistent
information on future levels of these species. For example, most
published AOGCM simulations have used CO),-equivalent
concentrations to represent the combined effect of the various
gases. Typically, only an annual 1% increase in CO>-equivalent
concentrations, which approximates changes in radiative forcing
of the IS92a emission scenario (Leggett et al., 1992), has been
used. However, between 10 and 40% of this increase results from
non-CO, greenhouse gases (Alcamo et al., 1995). The assumption
that CO, concentrations equal CO,-equivalent concentrations
(e.g., Schimel et al., 1997; Walker et al., 1999) has led to an
exaggeration of direct CO, effects. If impacts are to be assessed
more consistently, proper CO, concentration levels and CO,-
equivalent climate forcing must be used. Many recent impact
assessments that recognise these important requirements (e.g.,
Leemans et al., 1998; Prinn et al., 1999; Downing er al., 2000)
make use of tools such as scenario generators (see Section
13.5.2.1) that explicitly treat atmospheric trace gas concentrations.
Moreover, some recent AOGCM simulations now discriminate
between the individual forcings of different greenhouse gases (see
Chapter 9, Table 9.1)

The challenges are significant, but the record of progress
suggests that within the next decade the scientific community
will develop fully coupled dynamical (prognostic) models of the
full Earth system (e.g., the coupled physical climate, biogeo-
chemical, human sub-systems) that can be employed on multi-
decadal time-scales and at spatial scales relevant to strategic
impact assessment. Future models should certainly advance in
completeness and sophistication; however, the key will be to
demonstrate some degree of prognostic skill. The strategy will be
to couple the biogeochemical-physical climate system to
representations of key aspects of the human system, and then to
develop more coherent scenarios of human actions in the context

of feedbacks from the biogeochemical-physical climate system.

"There has been encouraging progress over this first decade of the
IPCC process. We understand better the coupling of the
atmosphere and ocean. Significant steps have been taken in linking
the atmosphere and the terrestrial systems although the focus tends
to be on water-energy and the biosphere with fixed vegetation
patterns. Even so, revealing and unexpected teleconnections are
being discovered; moreover, progress is being made towards
model structures and data sets that will allow implementation of
coupled atmosphere-ocean-terrestrial models that include key
biological-biogeochemical feedbacks. There is also encouraging
progress in developing integrated assessment models that couple
economic activity, with associated emissions and impacts, with
models of the biogeochemical and climate systems. This work
has yielded preliminary insights into system behaviour and key
policy-relevant uncertainties.

Expanded efforts are needed in these domain-specific
models. In the ocean, we need to consider better the controls on
thermohaline circulation, on potential changes in biological
productivity, and on the overall stability of the ocean circulation
system. Within terrestrial systems the question of the carbon
sink-source pattern is central: what is it and how might it change?
Connected to this question is the continued development of
dynamic vegetation models, which treat competitive processes
within terrestrial ecosystems and their response to multiple
stresses. And for the atmosphere, a central question has been, is,
and likely will be the role of clouds. Also, there is a correspon-
ding non-linearity associated with change in the distribution and
extent of sea ice. Further increased efforts will be needed in

ocean started later, but has proceeded in a similar manner. Models
that deal with the physics of the oceans have been developed and
linked to models of the atmospheric system. Within ocean models,
the inclusion of geochemical and biological interactions has
begun, with a focus upon the carbon cycle. Since the late 1960s,
the geochemical aspects of the carbon cycle have been included in
low-dimensional box models. More recently, including the carbon
chemistry system in general circulation models has simply been a
question of allocation of computing resources. Modelling of the
biological system, however, has been more challenging, and it has
only been recently that primitive ecosystem models have been
incorporated in global general circulation ocean models. Even
though progress has been significant, much remains to be done.
Eddy-resolving ocean models with chemistry and biology need to
be tested and validated in a transient mode, and the prognostic
aspects of marine ecosystems including nutrient dynamics need
greater attention at basin and global scales.

Model development for the ocean and atmosphere has had a
fundamental theoretical advantage: it is based on firmly
established hydrodynamic equations. At present there is less
theoretical basis for a “first principles” development of the
dynamical behaviour of the terrestrial system. There is a need to
develop a fundamental methodology to describe this very hetero-
geneous and complex system. For the moment, it is necessary to
rely heavily upon parametrizations and empirical relationships.
Such reliance is data intensive and hence independent validation
of terrestrial system models is problematical. In spite of these
difficulties, a co-ordinated strategy has been developed to
improve estimates of terrestrial primary productivity and respira-
tion by means of measurement and modelling. The strategy has
begun to yield dividends. Techniques from statistical mechanics
have been wedded to biogeochemistry and population ecology,
yielding new vegetation dynamic models. Global terrestrial
models at meso-spatial scales (roughly 50 km grids) now exist
which capture complex ecophysiological processes and
ecosystem dynamics.

Another important (and related) challenge is the initialisation
of the models so that the entire system is in balance, i.e., in statis-
tical equilibrium with respect to the fluxes of heat, water, and
momentum between the various components of the system. The
problem of determining appropriate initial conditions in which
fluxes are dynamically and thermodynamically balanced
throughout a coupled stiff system, such as the ocean-atmosphere
system, is particularly difficult because of the wide range of
adjustment times ranging from days to thousands of years. This
can lead to a “climate drift”, making interpretation of transient
climate calculations difficult (see Chapter 8, Section 8.4.1).

The initialisation of coupled models is important because it
produces the climate base state or “starting point” for climate
change experiments. Climate model initialisation continues to be
an area of active research and refinement of techniques (see
Chapter 8, Section 8.4). Most groups use long integrations of the
sub-component models to provide a dynamically and thermody-
namically balanced initial state for the coupled model integration.
However, there are at least as many different methods used to
initialise coupled models as there are modelling groups. See
Stouffer and Dixon (1998) for a more complete discussion of the
various issues and methods used to initialise coupled models.

Since the SAR, improvements in developing better initialisa-
tion techniques for coupled models have been realised. For
instance, starting with observed oceanic conditions has yielded
improved simulations with reduced climate drift (Gordon et al.,
1999). Earlier attempts with this technique usually resulted in
relatively large trends in the surface variables (Meehl and
Washington, 1995; Washington and Meehl, 1996). Successfully
starting long coupled integrations from observations is important
for a number of reasons: it simplifies the initialisation procedure,
saves time and effort, and reduces the overhead for starting new
coupled model integrations.

Integrations of models over long time-spans are prone to error as
small discrepancies from reality compound. Models, by defini-
tion, are reduced descriptions of reality and hence incomplete and
with error. Missing pieces and small errors can pose difficulties
when models of sub-systems such as the ocean and the
atmosphere are coupled. As noted in Chapter 8, Section 8.4.2, at
the time of the SAR most coupled models had difficulty in
reproducing a stable climate with current atmospheric concentra-
tions of greenhouse gases, and therefore non-physical “flux
adjustment terms” were added. In the past few years significant
progress has been achieved, but difficulties posed by the problem
of flux adjustment, while reduced, remain problematic and
continued investigations are needed to reach the objective of
avoiding dependence on flux adjustment (see Chapter 8, Section
8.4.2; see also Section 8.5.1.1).

"The climate system is particularly challenging since it is known that
components in the system are inherently chaotic; there are
feedbacks that could potentially switch sign, and there are central
processes that affect the system in a complicated, non-linear
manner. These complex, chaotic, non-linear dynamics are an
inherent aspect of the climate system. As the IPCC WGI Second
Assessment Report (IPCC, 1996) (hereafter SAR) has previously
noted, “future unexpected, large and rapid climate system changes
(as have occurred in the past) are, by their nature, difficult to predict.
This implies that future climate changes may also involve
‘surprises’. In particular, these arise from the non-linear, chaotic

“Reducing uncertainty in climate projections also requires a better

basis for models. Models are simply formal expressions of
processes and how they fit together. And all rest upon data.
Models are of limited use without observations; the value of
observations increases by interaction with models. Systematic
global observations are an essential underpinning of research to
improve understanding of the climate system. For numerous
applications in climate-impact research, information about the
complex nature of the system is needed. Unfortunately, there
continue to be justifiable concerns about the loss of some
monitoring of climate parameters and deterioration of coverage.
There is a basic need for more observations with better coverage,
higher accuracy, and with increased availability. This overriding
importance of data has been recognised repeatedly in the past and

reasons for guarded optimism on the issue of data even though
there are also significant reasons for concern. One such reason for
tempered optimism is the plan for and beginning implementation
of global observing systems such as the Global Climate Observing
System (GCOS), Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), and
Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS). However plans in
themselves do not produce data, and data that are not accessible
are of limited value. The issue of data remains central for progress.

It is anticipated that the grids used in the ocean sub-
components of the coupled climate models will begin to resolve
eddies by the next report. As the oceanic eddies become resolved
by the grid, the need for large diffusion coefficients and various
mixing schemes should be reduced (see Chapter 8, Section 8.9.3;
see also, however, the discussion in Section 8.9.2). In addition,
the amount of diapycnal mixing, which is used for numerical
stability in this class of ocean models, will also be reduced as the
grid spacing becomes smaller. This reduction in the sub-grid
scale oceanic mixing should reduce the uncertainty associated
with the mixing schemes and coefficients currently being used.

The evaluation of many types of extreme events is made
difficult because of issues of scale. Damaging extreme events are
often at small temporal and spatial scales. Intense, short-duration
events are not well-represented (or not represented at all) in
model-simulated climates. In addition, there is often a basic
mismatch between the scales resolved in models and those of the
validating data. A promising approach is to use multi-fractal
models of rainfall events in that they naturally generate extreme
events. Reanalysis has also helped in this regard, but reanalysis
per se is not the sole answer because the models used for
reanalysis rely on sub-grid scale parametrizations almost as
heavily as climate models do.

In sum, a strategy must recognise what is possible. In climate
research and modelling, we should recognise that we are dealing
with a coupled non-linear chaotic system, and therefore that the
long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible. The
most we can expect to achieve is the prediction of the probability
distribution of the system’s future possible states by the genera-
tion of ensembles of model solutions. This reduces climate
change to the discernment of significant differences in the statis-
tics of such ensembles. The generation of such model ensembles
will require the dedication of greatly increased computer
resources and the application of new methods of model
diagnosis. Addressing adequately the statistical nature of climate
is computationally intensive, but such statistical information is
essential.

"There is a natural tendency to produce models at finer spatial
scales that include both a wider array of processes and more
refined descriptions. Higher resolution can lead to better simula-

representation of topography. In the atmosphere, fine-scale
topography is particularly important for resolving small-scale
precipitation patterns (see Chapter 8, Section 8.9.1). In the ocean,
bottom topography is very important for the various boundary
flows (see Chapter 7, Section 7.3.4). The use of higher oceanic
resolution also improves the simulation of internal variability
such as ENSO (see Chapter 8, Section 8.7.1). However, in spite
of the use of higher resolution, important climatic processes are
still not resolved by the model’s grid, necessitating the continued
use of sub- -grid scale parametrizations.

"Extreme events are, almost by definition, of particular
importance to human society. Consequently, the importance of
understanding potential extreme events is first order. The
evidence is mixed, and data continue to be lacking to make
conclusive cases. Chapter 9, Sections 9.3.5 and 9.3.6 consider
projections of changes in patterns of variability (discussed in the
next section) and changes in extreme events (see also Chapters 2
and 10). Though the conclusions are mixed in both of these
topical areas, certain results begin to appear robust. There appear
to be some consistent patterns with increased CO, with respect to
changes in variability: (a) the Pacific climate base state could be
a more El Nijfio-like state and (b) an enhanced variability in the
daily precipitation in the Asian summer monsoon with increased
precipitation intensity (Chapter 9, Section 9.3.5). More generally,
the intensification of the hydrological cycle with increased CO,
is a robust conclusion. For possible changes in extreme weather
and climate events, the most robust conclusions appear to be: (a)
an increased probability of extreme warm days and decreased
probability of extreme cold days and (b) an increased chance of
drought for mid-continental areas during summer with increasing
CO, (see Chapter 9, Section 9.3.6).

"Underlying this issue of scale and detail is an important
tension. As the spatial and process detail in a model is increased,
the required computing resources increase, often significantly;
models with less detail may miss important non-linear dynamics
and feedbacks that affect model results significantly, and yet
simpler models may be more appropriate to generating the
needed statistics. The issue of spatial detail is intertwined with
the representation of the physical (and other) processes, and
hence the need for a balance between level of process detail and
spatial detail. These tensions must be recognised forthrightly,
and strategies must be devised to use the available computing
resources wisely. Analyses to determine the benefits of finer
scale and increased resolution need to be carefully considered.
These considerations must also recognise that the potential
predictive capability will be unavoidably statistical, and hence it
must be produced with statistically relevant information. This
implies that a variety of integrations (and models) must be used
to produce an ensemble of climate states. Climate states are
defined in terms of averages and statistical quantities applying
over a period typically of decades (see Chapter 7, Section 7.1.3
and Chapter 9, Section 9.2.2).

capability is sought for a system that is chaotic, that has signifi-

varying time constants). And within prognostic investigations of
such a complex system, the issue of predicting extreme events
presents a particularly vexing yet important problem. However,
there appear to be coherent modes of behaviour that not only

years (e.g., future equilibrium climates) to fractions of a second

physics must be included in modelling cloud formation and cloud
properties, but the demarcation between what must be included
and what can be parametrized remains unclear. Clarifying this
demarcation and improving both the resulting phenomenological

improved global observations of clouds (see Chapter 2, Section

observed on smaller scales, such as individual cloud systems and
cloud geometry, are not explicitly resolved. Without question, the
strategy for attacking the feedback question will involve compar-
ison of model simulations with appropriate observations on
global or local scales. The interplay of observation and models,
again, will be the key for progress. Mitchell (Mitchell, 2000)
states this clearly, “Unless there are stronger links between those
making observations and those using climate models, then there
is little chance of a reduction in the uncertainty in cloud feedback
in the next twenty years.” This is echoed in this report (see

single largest uncertainty in determining the climate sensitivity to

source of uncertainty in the estimates of the climate sensitivity
continues to be clouds (see also Chapter 7, Section 7.2). Since the
SAR, there have been a number of improvements in the simula-
tion of both the cloud distribution and in the radiative properties
of clouds (Chapter 7, Section 7.2.2). The simulation of cloud
distribution has improved as the overall simulation of the
atmospheric models has improved. In addition, the cloud sub-
component models used in the coupled models have become
more realistic. Also, our understanding of the radiative properties
of clouds and their effects on climate sensitivity have improved.
And yet in Chapter 7, Section 7.2.2 we find that, “In spite of these
improvements, there has been no apparent narrowing of the
uncertainty range associated with cloud feedbacks in current

It is not known whether these changes reflect anthropogenic
warming transmitted either from the atmosphere or the ocean or
whether they mostly reflect a major mode of multi-decadal
variability. Some of this pattern of warming has been attributed
to recent trends in the Arctic Oscillation (see Section 2.6);
however, how the anthropogenic signal is imprinted on the
natural patterns of climate variability remains a central question.
What does seem clear is that the changes in Arctic sea ice are
significant, and there is a positive feedback that could be
triggered by declines in sea-ice extent through changes in the
planetary albedo. If the Arctic shifted from being a bright
summer object to a less bright summer object, then this would be
an important positive feedback on a warming pattern (see the

Looking further back in time, we find an extraordinarily
regular record of change. The Vostok core (Figure 3.2d) captures
a remarkable and intriguing signal of the periodicity of inter-
glacial and glacial climate periods in step with the transfer of
significant pools of carbon from the land (most likely through the
atmosphere) to the ocean and then the recovery of terrestrial
carbon back from the ocean. The repeated pattern of a 100 to 120
ppmv decline in atmospheric CO, from an inter-glacial value of
280 to 300 ppmv to a 180 ppmv floor and then the rapid recovery
as the planet exits glaciation suggests a tightly governed control

if there were no marine biological system, then the pre-industrial
atmospheric CO, concentration would have been 450 ppmv
instead of 280 ppmvy (Sarmiento and Toggweiler 1984; Maier-
Raimer et al., 1996). Any complete model of the natural ocean
carbon cycle should therefore include the biological system;
however, most recent assessments of the oceanic uptake of anthro-
pogenic CO, have assumed that the biological system would not
be affected by climate change and have therefore only modelled
the chemical solubility in addition to the physical circulation. This
was based on the understanding that nitrate or other nutrients limit
marine phytoplankton growth. There would therefore be no CO
fertilisation effect as has been suggested for terrestrial plants and
that, unless there was a large change in the nutrient supply to the
upper ocean because of a climate-induced shift in circulation, then
no extra anthropogenic CO, could be sequestered to the deep
ocean by the organic matter pump. More recently, a number of
studies have suggested possible ways in which the organic matter
pump might be affected by climate change over a 200-year time-
scale (see Chapter 3, Sections 3.2.3.2 and 3.2.3.3). The main
conclusion was that, because of the complexity of biological
systems, it was not yet possible to say whether some of the likely
feedbacks would be positive or negative. However, it is clear that
our understanding of these issues needs to be improved.

Modelling interactions between terrestrial and atmospheric
systems requires coupling successional models to biogeochem-
ical models and physiological models that describe the exchange
of water and energy between vegetation and the atmosphere at
fine time-scales. At each step toward longer time-scales, the
climate system integrates the more fine-scaled processes and
applies feedbacks onto the terrestrial biome. At the finest time-
scales, the influence of temperature, radiation, humidity and
winds has a dramatic effect on the ability of plants to transpire.
On longer time-scales, integrated weather patterns regulate
biological processes such as the timing of leaf emergence or
excision, uptake of nitrogen by autotrophs, and rates of organic
soil decay and turnover of inorganic nitrogen. The effect of
climate at the annual or interannual scale defines the net gain or
loss of carbon by the biota, its water status for the subsequent
growing season, and even its ability to survive.

areas depends upon the intensity and length of the agricultural
activity and the amount of soil organic matter on the site at the
time of abandonment. To simulate the biogeochemistry of
secondary vegetation, models must capture patterns of plant
growth during secondary succession. These patterns depend
substantially on the nutrient pools inherited from the previous
stage. The changes in hydrology need also to be considered, since
plants that experience water stress will alter the allocation of
carbon to allocate more carbon to roots. Processes such as

energy balance and provide key controls over biogenic trace gas
production. Looking at the carbon fixation-organic material
decomposition as a linked process, one sees that some of the
carbon fixed by photosynthesis and incorporated into plant tissue
is perhaps delayed from returning to the atmosphere until it is
oxidised by decomposition or fire. This slower carbon loop
through the terrestrial component of the carbon cycle affects the
rate of growth of atmospheric CO, concentration and, in its
shorter term expression, imposes a seasonal cycle on that trend
(Chapter 3, Figure 3.2a). The structure of terrestrial ecosystems,
which respond on even longer time-scales, is determined by the
integrated response to changes in climate and to the intermediate
time-scale carbon-nutrient machinery. The loop is closed back to
the climate system, since it is the structure of ecosystems,
including species composition, that largely sets the terrestrial

Most of the effort in three-dimensional atmospheric
chemistry models over the last decade has been in the use of
transport models in the analysis of certain chemically active
species, e.g., long-lived gases such as nitrous oxide (N,O) or the
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). In part, the purpose of these
studies was not to improve our understanding of the chemistry
of the atmosphere, but rather to improve the transport formula-
tion associated with general circulation models and, in associa-
tion with this improvement, to understand sources and sinks of
CO). The additional burden imposed by incorporating detailed
chemistry into a comprehensive general circulation model has
made long-term simulations and transient experiments with
existing computing resources challenging. Current three-
dimensional atmospheric chemistry models which focus on the
stratosphere seek a compromise solution by employing coarse
resolution (both vertical and horizontal dimensions); incorpo-
rating constituents by families (similar to the practice used in
most two-dimensional models); omitting or simplifying
parametrizations for tropospheric physical processes; or
conducting “off line” transport simulations in which previously
calculated wind and temperature fields are used as known input
to continuity equations including chemical source/sink terms.
This last approach renders the problem tractable and has
produced much progress towards understanding the transport of
chemically reacting species in the atmosphere. The correspon-
ding disadvantage is the lack of the interactive feedback
between the evolving species distributions and the atmospheric
circulation. Better descriptions of the complex relationship

original vegetation (e.g., Claussen, 1996). Regional climate
simulations, on the other hand, have shown that at the continental
scale, important teleconnections may exist through which more
modest tropical forest clearing may cause a change in climate in
undisturbed areas. Coupling the global to the local is a key
challenge; regional studies may prove to be uniquely valuable.

influences generally are treated only through emission
scenarios that provide external forcings to the climate system.
In future comprehensive models, human activities will interact
with the dynamics of physical, chemical, and biological sub-
systems through a diverse set of contributing activities,
feedbacks, and responses. This does not mean that it is
necessary or even logical to attempt to develop prognostic
models of human actions since much will remain inherently

Land-use “change illustrates the potential complexity of
linkages between human activity and major non-human
components of the Earth system. The terrestrial biosphere is
fundamentally modified by land clearing for agriculture,
industrialisation, urbanisation, and by forest and rangeland
management practices. These changes affect the atmosphere
through an altered energy balance over the more intensively
managed parts of the land surface, as well as through changed
fluxes of water vapour, CO, CH, and other trace gases between
soils, vegetation, and the atmosphere. Changed land use also
greatly alters the fluxes of carbon, nutrients, and inorganic
sediments into river systems, and consequently into oceanic
coastal zones.

"The problems associated with how to treat clouds within the
climate system are linked to problems associated with aerosols.
Current model treatments of climate forcing from aerosols
predict effects that are not easily consistent with the past
climate record. A major challenge is to develop and validate the
treatments of the microphysics of clouds and their interactions
with aerosols on the scale of a general circulation model grid. A
second major challenge is to develop an understanding of the
carbon components of the aerosol system. Meeting this
challenge requires that we develop data for a mechanistic
understanding of carbonaceous aerosol effects on clouds as well
as developing an understanding of the magnitude of the anthro-
pogenic and natural components of the carbonaceous aerosol
system. (See Chapter 6, Sections 6.7 and 6.8; see also Chapter

In sum, there needs to be an expanded attack on the key
contributors to uncertainty about the behaviour of the climate
system today and in the future. As stated in Chapter 13, Section
13.1.2, “Scenarios should also provide adequate quantitative
measures of uncertainty. The sources of uncertainty are many,
including the trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions in the
future, their conversion into atmospheric concentrations, the
range of responses of various climate models to a given
radiative forcing and the method of constructing high resolution
information from global climate model outputs (see Chapter 13,
Figure 13.2). For many purposes, simply defining a single
climate future is insufficient and unsatisfactory. Multiple
climate scenarios that address at least one, or preferably several,
sources of uncertainty allow these uncertainties to be quantified
and explicitly accounted for in impact assessments.”

As attention is turned toward the troposphere, the experi-
mental strategy simply cannot adopt the stratospheric simplifi-
cations. The uneven distribution of emission sources at the
surface of the Earth and the role of meteorological processes at
various scales must be addressed directly. Fine-scaled, three-
dimensional models of chemically active trace gases in the
troposphere are needed to resolve transport processes at the
highest possible resolution. These models should be designed to
simulate the chemistry and transport of atmospheric tracers on
global and regional scales, with accurate parametrizations of
sub-scale processes that affect the chemical composition of the
troposphere. It is therefore necessary to pursue an ambitious
long-term programme to develop comprehensive models of the
troposphere system, including chemical, dynamical, radiative,
and eventually biological components. (See Chapter 4, Sections
4.4 to 4.6.)

These kinds of difficulties intrinsically limit the predictive

consequence, research on human drivers and responses to climate
change cannot be expected to produce conventional predictions
beyond a very short time horizon. This does not imply, however,

Similarly, we have a fairly good grasp on particular kinds of
intellectual processes — in particular, the logic of rational choice —
but we are doing less well when it comes to understanding how
beliefs, attitudes and values change and how change in these
factors in turn affects manifest human behaviour, such as
consumption patterns. To address these challenges we need more
interdisciplinary research designed to integrate knowledge from
different fields and sub-fields into a more holistic understanding
of “the human system”. The intellectual and organisational
problems involved should not be underestimated, but we are
confident that the prospects for making progress along this
frontier are better now than ever before.

"The other main challenge is to find better ways of integrating
models of the biogeophysical Earth system with models of social
systems and human behaviour. Some encouraging progress has
been made at this interface, particularly over the last decade. For
example, there has been a rapid increase in attempts to integrate
representations of human activities in models with explicit formal
linkages to other components of the Earth system. Such integrated
assessment models have offered preliminary characterisations of
human-climate linkages, particularly through models of multiple
linked human and climate stresses on land cover. Moreover, they
have provided preliminary characterisation of broad classes of
policy responses, and have been employed to characterise and
prioritise policy-relevant uncertainties.

Causal models of social processes have large uncertainties,
and pose problems that are of a qualitatively different character
than those encountered in modelling non-human components of
the Earth system. This is due, first and foremost, to the inherent
reflexivity of human behaviour; i.e., the fact that human beings
have intellectual capabilities and emotional endowments enabling
them to invent new solutions and transcend established “laws” in
ways that no other species can do. As a consequence, predictive
models may well alter the behaviour that they seek to predict and
explain — indeed, such models are sometimes deliberately used
exactly for that purpose. Moreover, the diversity of societies,
cultures, and political and economic systems often frustrates
attempts to generalise findings and propositions from one setting
to another. Representation of human behaviour at the micro
(individual) and macro (collective) scale may require fundamen-
tally different approaches (see Gibson et al., 1998).

"Human land-use change will continue and probably
accelerate due to increasing demands for food and fibre, changes
in forest and water management practices, and possibly large-
scale projects to sequester carbon in forests or to produce
biomass fuels. In addition, anthropogenic changes in material
and energy fluxes, resulting from such activities as fossil fuel
combustion and chemical fertiliser use, are expected to increase
in the coming decades. Predictions of changes in the carbon and
nitrogen cycles are sensitive to estimates of human activity and
predictions of the impacts of these global changes must take into
account human vulnerability, adaptation, and response.
Predicting the future response of the Earth system to changes in
climate and in parallel to changes in land use and land cover will
require projections of trends in the human contributions to these
global changes; this sort of modelling presents difficult
challenges because of the multiple factors operating at local,
regional, continental, and global levels to influence local land-
use decisions.

 
"	Text
" 

To make the most of this potential, further progress is required
along two main frontiers. One challenge is to develop a more
integrated understanding of social systems and human behaviour.
With some exceptions, the first generation of models in this area
represented “the human system” by a few key variables. For
example, resource use was often conceived of as a function of
population size and income level. The performance of such
simplistic models was by-and-large poor. It is abundantly clear
that the impact of human activities as drivers of climate change
depends upon a complex set of interrelated factors, including also
technologies in use, social institutions, and individual beliefs,
attitudes, and values. At present, it seems fair to say that we have
a reasonably good theoretical grasp of important types of institu-
tions, such as markets and hierarchies, in ideal-type form. What
we need to understand better is how their impure real-world
counterparts work, and to improve our understanding of the
intricate interplay of institutional complexes, i.e., how markets,
governments and other social institutions interact to shape human
behaviour. Research in political economy clearly indicates that
phenomena such as economic growth are to a significant extent
affected by the functioning of interlocking networks of institu-

tional arrangements.

smaller social systems. Aggregate global-scale estimates are of
limited use in this context; human sensitivity to climate change
varies significantly across regions and social groups, and so does
response capacity. We can expect to see some progress in allevi-
ating the spatial resolution problem, as regional-scale models of
climate change are further developed, but we have to recognise
that the scale problems are fundamental and that no quick fixes are
in sight. The other problem pertains to the interface between
different methodological approaches. In particular, concerted
efforts are required to develop better tools for coupling approaches
relying on numerical modelling with “softer” approaches using
interpretative frameworks and qualitative methods. Some of these
differences are too profound to be eliminated, but that does not
imply that bridges cannot be built. Learning how to work more

further development of integrated global change research. Again,

Given the complexity of the climate system and the inherent
multi-decadal time-scale, there is a central and unavoidable need
for long-term consistent data to support climate and environ-
mental change investigations. Data from the present and recent
past, credible global climate-relevant data for the last few
centuries, along with lower frequency data for the last several
millennia, are all needed. Research observational data sets that
span significant temporal and spatial scales are needed so that
models can be refined, validated, or perhaps, most importantly,
rejected. The elimination of models because they are in conflict
with climate-relevant data is particularly important. Running
unrealistic models will consume scarce computing resources, and
the results may add unrealistic information to the needed distri-
bution functions. Such data must be adequate in temporal and
spatial coverage, in parameters measured, and in precision, to
permit meaningful validation. We are still unfortunately short of
data for the quantitative assessment of extremes on the global

A numerical representation of the climate system based on the
physical, chemical and biological properties of its components,
their interactions and feedback processes, and accounting for all
or some of its known properties. The climate system can be
represented by models of varying complexity, i.e. for any one
component or combination of components a hierarchy of models
can be identified, differing in such aspects as the number of
spatial dimensions, the extent to which physical, chemical or
biological processes are explicitly represented, or the level at
which empirical —parametrizations are involved. Coupled
atmosphere/ocean/sea-ice General Circulation Models
(AOGCMs) provide a comprehensive representation of the
climate system. There is an evolution towards more complex
models with active chemistry and biology.

a fluctuation of the intertropical surface pressure pattern and
circulation in the Indian and Pacific oceans, called the Southern
Oscillation. This coupled atmosphere-ocean phenomenon is
collectively known as El Nifio-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO.
During an El Nifio event, the prevailing trade winds weaken and
the equatorial countercurrent strengthens, causing warm surface
waters in the Indonesian area to flow eastward to overlie the cold
waters of the Peru current. This event has great impact on the
wind, sea surface temperature and precipitation patterns in the
tropical Pacific. It has climatic effects throughout the Pacific

characterising the decay of an instantaneous pulse input into the
reservoir. The term adjustment time is also used to characterise
the adjustment of the mass of a reservoir following a step change
in the source strength. Half-life or decay constant is used to
quantify a first-order exponential decay process. See:
—Response time, for a different definition pertinent to climate
variations. The term lifetime is sometimes used, for simplicity, as
a surrogate for adjustment time.

This is an index on a 4-step scale (High, Medium, Low and Very
Low) designed to characterise the degree of scientific
understanding of the radiative forcing agents that affect climate
change. For each agent, the index represents a subjective
judgement about the reliability of the estimate of its forcing,
involving such factors as the assumptions necessary to evaluate
the forcing, the degree of knowledge of the physical/ chemical
mechanisms determining the forcing and the uncertainties
surrounding the quantitative estimate.

The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted at the
Third Session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the
United Nations >Framework Convention on Climate Change, in
1997 in Kyoto, Japan. It contains legally binding commitments,
in addition to those included in the UNFCCC. Countries included
in Annex B of the Protocol (most OECD countries and countries
with economies in transition) agreed to reduce their
anthropogenic —greenhouse gas emissions (CO, CHy, NO,
HFCs, PFCs, and SF¢) by at least 5% below 1990 levels in the
commitment period 2008 to 2012. The Kyoto Protocol has not
yet entered into force (April 2001).

"—Carbon dioxide (CO) is an extreme example. Its turnover time
is only about 4 years because of the rapid exchange between
atmosphere and the ocean and terrestrial biota. However, a large
part of that CO, is returned to the atmosphere within a few years.
Thus, the adjustment time of CO, in the atmosphere is actually
determined by the rate of removal of carbon from the surface
layer of the oceans into its deeper layers. Although an approxi-
mate value of 100 years may be given for the adjustment time of
CO), in the atmosphere, the actual adjustment is faster initially
and slower later on. In the case of methane (CHy) the adjustment
time is different from the turnover time, because the removal is
mainly through a chemical reaction with the hydroxyl radical
OH, the concentration of which itself depends on the CHy
concentration. Therefore the CH, removal S is not proportional to
its total mass M.

The North Atlantic Oscillation consists of opposing variations

Natural variability of the climate system, in particular on
seasonal and longer time-scales, predominantly occurs in
preferred spatial patterns, through the dynamical non-linear
characteristics of the atmospheric circulation and through
interactions with the land and ocean surfaces. Such spatial
patterns are also called “regimes” or “modes”. Examples are the
North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Pacific-North
American pattern (PNA), the El Nifio-Southern Oscillation
(ENSO), and the Antarctic Oscillation (AO).

Ozone, the triatomic form of oxygen (O3), is a gaseous
atmospheric constituent. In the —troposphere it is created both
naturally and by photochemical reactions involving gases
resulting from human activities (“smog”). Tropospheric ozone
acts as a greenhouse gas. In the stratosphere it is created by
the interaction between solar ultraviolet radiation and molecular
oxygen (O,). Stratospheric ozone plays a decisive role in the
stratospheric radiative balance. Its concentration is highest in the
ozone layer.
"	Text
"EE ED

The stratosphere contains a layer in which the concentration of
ozone is greatest, the so called ozone layer. The layer extends
from about 12 to 40 km. The ozone concentration reaches a
maximum between about 20 and 25 km. This layer is being
depleted by human emissions of chlorine and bromine
compounds. Every year, during the Southern Hemisphere spring,
a very strong depletion of the ozone layer takes place over the
Antarctic region, also caused by human-made chlorine and
bromine compounds in combination with the specific meteoro-
logical conditions of that region. This phenomenon is called the
ozone hole.

A projection is a potential future evolution of a quantity or set of

The —non-linearity of the climate system may lead to rapid
climate change, sometimes called abrupt events or even
surprises. Some such abrupt events may be imaginable, such as a
dramatic reorganisation of the thermohaline circulation, rapid
deglaciation, or massive melting of permafrost leading to fast
changes in the carbon cycle. Others may be truly unexpected,
as a consequence of a strong, rapidly changing, forcing of a non-
linear system.

Radiative forcing is the change in the net vertical irradiance
(expressed in Watts per square metre: Wm?) at the
—tropopause due to an internal change or a change in the
external forcing of the climate system, such as, for example,
a change in the concentration of carbon dioxide or the output
of the Sun. Usually radiative forcing is computed after allowing
for stratospheric temperatures to readjust to radiative equilib-
rium, but with all tropospheric properties held fixed at their
unperturbed values. Radiative forcing is called instantaneous if
no change in stratospheric temperature is accounted for.
Practical problems with this definition, in particular with
respect to radiative forcing associated with changes, by
aerosols, of the precipitation formation by clouds, are discussed
in Chapter 6 of this Report.

The global mean surface air temperature and sea level
projections, based on the SRES scenarios, have been calculated
using Simple Climate models which have been “tuned” to get
similar responses to the AOGCMs in the global mean (see
Chapters 9 and 11 for details).

"Appendix II gives, in tabulated form, the values for emissions,
abundances and burdens, and, radiative forcing of major
greenhouse gases and aerosols based on the SRES! scenarios
(Naki¢enovié et. al., 2000). The Appendix also presents global
projections of changes in surface air temperature and sea level
using these SRES emission scenarios.

The results presented are global mean values, every ten years

from 2000 to 2100, for a range of scenarios. These scenarios are
the final approved Illustrative Marker Scenarios (A1B, AIT,
AIFI, A2, B1, and B2); the preliminary marker scenarios (Alp,
A2p, Blp, B2p, approved by the IPCC Bureau in June 1998) and,
for comparison and for some species, results based on a previous
scenario used by IPCC (1S92a) have also been added. For some
gases, the values tabulated in the IPCC Second Assessment
Report (IPCC, 1996; hereafter SAR), for that IS92a scenario
using the previous generation of chemistry and climate models,
are also given.

"Chapter 6, Table 6.2. The radiative forcings associated with
future tropospheric O} increase are calculated on the basis of the
O; changes presented in Chapter 4 for the various SRES
scenarios. The mean forcing per DU estimated from the various
models, and given in Chapter 6, Table 6.3 (i.e., 0.042 Wm-/DU),
is used to derive these future forcings. For each aerosol species,
the ratio of the column burdens for the particular scenario to that
of the year 2000 is multiplied by the “best estimate” of the
present day radiative forcing (see Chapter 6 for more details).
The radiative forcings for all the species have been calculated
since pre-industrial time.

The emission values are only anthropogenic emissions and
are the ones published in Appendix VII of the SRES Report.
Apart from the CO, emissions, for which deforestation and land
use values are given in the SRES Report, the SRES scenarios for
the rest of the gases define only the changes in direct
anthropogenic emissions and do not specify the current
magnitude of the natural emissions nor the concurrent changes in
natural emissions due either to direct human activities such as
land-use change or to the indirect impacts of climate change.
Emissions for black carbon (BC) aerosols and organic matter
carbonaceous (OC) aerosols species not covered in the SRES
Report, are calculated by scaling to the SRES anthropogenic CO
emissions.

"Note: A “reference” case was defined with climate sensitivity 2.5°C, ocean uptake corresponding to the mean of the ocean model results in
Chapter 3, Figure 3.10, and terrestrial uptake corresponding to the mean of the responses of mid-range models, LPJ, IBIS and SDGM (Chapter 3,
Figure 3.10). A “low CO,” parametrization was chosen with climate sensitivity 1.5°C and maximal CO, uptake by oceans and land. A “high CO,”
parametrization was defined with climate sensitivity 4.5°C and minimal CO, uptake by oceans and land. See Chapter 3, Box 3.7, and Jain et al.
(1994) for more details on the ISAM model.

The IS92a column values are calculated using the ISAM parametrization noted above with IS92a emissions starting in the year 2000; whereas the
IS92a/SAR column refers to values as reported in the SAR using IS92a emissions starting in 1990, using the SAR parametrization of ISAM.

"Note: A “reference” case was defined with an average ocean uptake for the 1980s of 2.0 PgC/yr. A “low CO,” parameterisation was obtained by
combining a “fast ocean” (ocean uptake of 2.54 PgC/yr for the 1980s) and no response of heterotrophic respiration to temperature. A “high CO,
parameterisation was obtained by combining a “slow ocean “ (ocean uptake of 1.46 PgC/yr for the 1980s) and capping CO, fertilisation. Climat
sensitivity was set to 2.5°C for a doubling of CO). See Chapter 3, Box 3.7 for more details on the Bern—CC model.

The IS92a/SAR column refers to values as reported in the SAR using IS92a emissions; whereas the IS92a column is calculated using IS92a
emissions but with year 2000 starting values and the BERN-CC model as described in Chapter 3.

The Bern-CC model was initialised for observed atmospheric CO, which was prescribed for the period 1765 to 1999. The CO, data were
smoothed by a spline. Scenario calculations started at the begining of the year 2000. This explains the difference in the values given for the year:
upto 2000. Values shown are for the beginning of each year. Annual-mean values are generally higher (up to 7ppm) depending on the scenario ai
the year.

"II.3: Radiative Forcing (Wm?) (relative to pre-industrial period, 1750)
"	Title
"The concentrations of CO, and CH, considered here correspond to the year 2000 and differ slightly from those considered in Chapter 6 which used
the values corresponding to the year 1998 (as appropriate for the time frame when Chapter 6 began its preparation). The resulting difference in the
computed present day forcings is about 3% in the case of CO, and about 2% in the case of CHy. For N,O, the difference in the computed forcings is
negligible. In the case of tropospheric ozone, the forcing for the year 2000 given here and that in Chapter 6 are the results of slightly different
scenarios employed which leads to about a 9% difference in the forcings. For the halogen containing compounds, the absolute differences in concen-
trations between here and Chapter 6 lead to a difference in present day forcing of less than 0.002 Wm for any species.
