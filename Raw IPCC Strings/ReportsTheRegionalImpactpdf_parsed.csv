"The assessment of each region’s vulnerability to climate change shares a common structure to facilitate comparison of
information. The focus is on sensitivity, adaptation options, critical zones, and especially vulnerable regions/countries or
sectors/resources. The regional assessments have been prepared by leading researchers. The report is based on information
contained in the IPCC Second Assessment Report and integrates the most recent research on the topics affecting these regions.

"This assessment reveals that human health, ecological systems, and socioeconomic sectors are vulnerable to changes in climate,
including the magnitude and rate of climate change, as well as to changes in climate variability. It also illustrates that the
increasing costs of climate and climate variability, in terms of loss of human life and capital due to floods, storms, and
droughts, are a result of the lack of adjustment and response in society’s policies and use of resources. This book points to
management options that would make many sectors more resilient to current variability in climate and thus help these sectors
adapt to future changes in climate.

assess the scientific and technical literature on climate change,
the potential impacts of changes in climate, and options for
adaption to and mitigation of climate change. Since its incep-

Special Reports, Technical Papers, methodologies, and other
products which have become standard works of reference,
widely used by policymakers, scientists, and other experts.

"As usual in the IPCC, success in producing this report has
depended on the enthusiasm and cooperation of numerous sci-

given generously of their time, often going beyond reasonable
demands of duty. We applaud, admire, and are grateful for their
commitment to the IPCC process. We are pleased to note the
continuing efforts made by the IPCC to ensure participation of
scientists and other experts from the developing countries and
countries with economies in transition. Given the regional
focus of this report, their participation was especially essential
to its successful completion. We also express our thanks to the
many governments, including those in the developing regions

"This Special Report, which has been produced by Working
Group II of the IPCC, builds on the Working Group’s contri-
bution to the Second Assessment Report (SAR), and incorpo-
rates more recent information made available since mid-1995.
It has been prepared in response to a request from the
Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice
(SBSTA) of the UN Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC). It addresses an important question posed
by the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC,
namely, the degree to which human conditions and the natur-
al environment are vulnerable to the potential effects of cli-
mate change. The report establishes a common base of infor-
mation regarding the potential costs and benefits of climatic
change, including the evaluation of uncertainties, to help the
COP determine what adaptation and mitigation measures
might be justified. The report consists of vulnerability assess-
ments for 10 regions that comprise the Earth’s entire land sur-
face and adjoining coastal seas: Africa, Arid Western Asia
(including the Middle East), Australasia, Europe, Latin
America, North America, the Polar Regions (The Arctic and
the Antarctic), Small Island States, Temperate Asia, and
Tropical Asia. It also includes several annexes that provide
information about climate observations, climate projections,
vegetation distribution projections, and socioeconomic trends.

more research and analysis of adaptation options and adjustment

climate variability, and to limit damage from—or take advantage
of—potential long-term changes in climate.

"The report is also an initial step in examining how projected
changes in climate could interact with other environmental
changes (e.g., biodiversity loss, land degradation, stratospheric
ozone depletion, and degradation of water resources) and
social trends (e.g., population growth, economic development,
and technological progress). The assessment indicates that
additional research into the interlinkages among environmental
issues also is needed.

"The Special Report explores the potential consequences of
changes in climate for ten continental- or subcontinental-
scale regions. Because of the uncertainties associated with
regional projections of climate change, the report necessarily
takes the approach of assessing sensitivities and vulnerabili-
ties of each region, rather than attempting to provide quanti-
tative predictions of the impacts of climate change. As in the
SAR, “vulnerability” is the extent to which climate change
may damage or harm a system; it is a function of both sensi-
tivity to climate and the ability to adapt to new conditions.

ment. In doing so, advances in the ability to project climatic
and environmental changes on finer scales will be an important
consideration. The report provides a foundation for the TAR in
another important respect, as it represents a substantial further
step forward in increasing the level of participation of scien-

"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has
produced a series of Assessment Reports, Special Reports,
Technical Papers, and methodologies. As an intergovernmental
body, the IPCC has procedures governing the production of
each of these. This Special Report on the Regional Impacts of
Climate Change was first requested by the Subsidiary Body for
Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) of the
Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as a
Technical Paper, which restricted the authors to using only
materials already in IPCC Assessment Reports and Special
Reports. In the course of drafting the paper, the authors felt that
the inclusion of new literature that had become available since
the completion of the IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR),
including work undertaken under the auspices of several “country
studies programs,” would make the paper more complete, up-
to-date, and broadly representative of trends and vulnerabilities
in the regions. Including these materials in the report would not
have conformed to the IPCC procedures for Technical Papers;
hence, the IPCC decided at its Twelfth Session (Mexico City,
11-13 September 1996) to rewrite the Technical Paper as a
Special Report, and SBSTA was informed accordingly.

of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its subsidiary bodies (specif-
ically, the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological
Advice—SBSTA). The special report provides, on a regional
basis, a review of state-of-the-art information on the vulnera-

socioeconomic sectors (including agriculture, fisheries, water
resources, and human settlements), and human health. The

"Human activities (primarily the burning of fossil fuels and
changes in land use and land cover) are increasing the atmos-
pheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, which alter radiative
balances and tend to warm the atmosphere, and, in some
regions, aerosols—which have an opposite effect on radiative
balances and tend to cool the atmosphere. At present, in some
locations primarily in the Northern Hemisphere, the cooling
effects of aerosols can be large enough to more than offset the
warming due to greenhouse gases. Since aerosols do not remain
in the atmosphere for long periods and global emissions of their
precursors are not projected to increase substantially, aerosols
will not offset the global long-term effects of greenhouse gases,
which are long-lived. Aerosols can have important conse-
quences for continental-scale patterns of climate change.

"This report assesses the vulnerability of natural and social sys-
tems of major regions of the world to climate change.
Vulnerability is defined as the extent to which a natural or
social system is susceptible to sustaining damage from climate
change. Vulnerability is a function of the sensitivity of a sys-
tem to changes in climate (the degree to which a system will
respond to a given change in climate, including both beneficial
and harmful effects) and the ability to adapt the system to
changes in climate (the degree to which adjustments in prac-
tices, processes, or structures can moderate or offset the poten-
tial for damage or take advantage of opportunities created, due
to a given change in climate). Under this framework, a highly
vulnerable system would be one that is highly sensitive to
modest changes in climate, where the sensitivity includes the
potential for substantial harmful effects, and one for which the
ability to adapt is severely constrained.
"	Text
"These changes in greenhouse gases and aerosols, taken together,
are projected to lead to regional and global changes in tempera-
ture, precipitation, and other climate variables—resulting in
global changes in soil moisture, an increase in global mean sea
level, and prospects for more severe extreme high-temperature
events, floods, and droughts in some places. Based on the range
of sensitivities of climate to changes in the atmospheric con-
centrations of greenhouse gases (IPCC 1996, WG I) and plausi-
ble changes in emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols
(1S92a-f, scenarios that assume no climate policies), climate
models project that the mean annual global surface temperature
will increase by 1-3.5°C by 2100, that global mean sea level
will rise by 15-95 cm, and that changes in the spatial and tem-
poral patterns of precipitation would occur. The average rate of
warming probably would be greater than any seen in the past
10,000 years, although the actual annual to decadal rate would
include considerable natural variability, and regional changes
could differ substantially from the global mean value. These
long-term, large-scale, human-induced changes will interact
with natural variability on time scales of days to decades [e.g.,
the El Nifo-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon] and
thus influence social and economic well-being. Possible local

"Scientific studies show that human health, ecological systems,
and socioeconomic sectors (e.g., hydrology and water
resources, food and fiber production, coastal systems, and
human settlements), all of which are vital to sustainable devel-
opment, are sensitive to changes in climate—including both
the magnitude and rate of climate change—as well as to
changes in climate variability. Whereas many regions are like-
ly to experience adverse effects of climate change—some of
which are potentially irreversible—some effects of climate
change are likely to be beneficial. Climate change represents
an important additional stress on those systems already affect-
ed by increasing resource demands, unsustainable management
practices, and pollution, which in many cases may be equal to
or greater than those of climate change. These stresses will
interact in different ways across regions but can be expected to
reduce the ability of some environmental systems to provide,
on a sustained basis, key goods and services needed for suc-
cessful economic and social development, including adequate
food, clean air and water, energy, safe shelter, low levels of dis-
ease, and employment opportunities. Climate change also will
take place in the context of economic development, which may
make some groups or countries less vulnerable to climate
change—for example, by increasing the resources available for
adaptation; those that experience low rates of growth, rapid
increases in population, and ecological degradation may
become increasingly vulnerable to potential changes.

of factors affecting decisionmaking—including government

"It is in part because of the uncertainties regarding how climate
will change that this report takes the approach of assessing vul-
nerabilities rather than assessing quantitatively the expected
impacts of climate change. The estimates are best interpreted
as illustrative of the potential character and approximate mag-
nitudes of impacts that may result from specific scenarios of
climate change. They serve as indicators of sensitivities and
possible vulnerabilities. Most commonly, the estimates are
based upon changes in equilibrium climate that have been sim-
ulated to result from an equivalent doubling of carbon dioxide
(CO,) in the atmosphere. Usually the simulations have exclud-
ed the effects of aerosols. Increases in global mean tempera-
tures corresponding to these scenarios mostly fall in the range
of 2-5°C. To provide a temporal context for these scenarios,
the range of projected global mean warming by 2100 is
1-3.5°C accompanied by a mean sea-level rise of 15-95 cm,
according to the IPCC Second Assessment Report. General
circulation model (GCM) results are used in this analysis to
justify the order of magnitude of the changes used in the sensi-
tivity analyses. They are not predictions that climate will
change by specific magnitudes in particular countries or
regions. The amount of literature available for assessment
varies in quantity and quality among the regions.

"Ecosystems are of fundamental importance to environmental
function and to sustainability, and they provide many goods and
services critical to individuals and societies. These goods and
services include: (i) providing food, fiber, fodder, shelter, med-
icines, and energy; (ii) processing and storing carbon and nutri-
ents; (iii) assimilating wastes; (iv) purifying water, regulating
water runoff, and moderating floods; (v) building soils and
reducing soil degradation; (vi) providing opportunities for
recreation and tourism; and (vii) housing the Earth’s entire
reservoir of genetic and species diversity. In addition, natural
ecosystems have cultural, religious, aesthetic, and intrinsic exis-
tence values. Changes in climate have the potential to affect the
geographic location of ecological systems, the mix of species
that they contain, and their ability to provide the wide range of
benefits on which societies rely for their continued existence.
Ecological systems are intrinsically dynamic and are constantly
influenced by climate variability. The primary influence of
anthropogenic climate change on ecosystems is expected to be
through the rate and magnitude of change in climate means and
extremes—climate change is expected to occur at a rapid rate
relative to the speed at which ecosystems can adapt and reestab-
lish themselves—and through the direct effects of increased
atmospheric CO, concentrations, which may increase the pro-
ductivity and efficiency of water use in some plant species.
Secondary effects of climate change involve changes in soil
characteristics and disturbance regimes (e.g., fires, pests, and
diseases), which would favor some species over others and thus
change the species composition of ecosystems.

"Water availability is an essential component of welfare and
productivity. Currently, 1.3 billion people do not have access
to adequate supplies of safe water, and 2 billion people do not
have access to adequate sanitation. Although these people are
dispersed throughout the globe—reflecting sub-national vari-
ations in water availability and quality—some 19 countries
(primarily in the Middle East and north and southern Africa)
face such severe shortfalls that they are classified as either
water-scarce or water-stressed; this number is expected to
roughly double by 2025, in large part because of increases in
demand resulting from economic and population growth. For
example, most policy makers now recognize drought as a
recurrent feature of Africa’s climate. However, climate change
will further exacerbate the frequency and magnitude of
droughts in some places.

"Changes in climate could exacerbate periodic and chronic
shortfalls of water, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas of
the world. Developing countries are highly vulnerable to cli-
mate change because many are located in arid and semi-arid
regions, and most derive their water resources from single-
point systems such as bore holes or isolated reservoirs. These
systems, by their nature, are vulnerable because there is no
redundancy in the system to provide resources, should the pri-
mary supply fail. Also, given the limited technical, financial,
and management resources possessed by developing countries,
adjusting to shortages and/or implementing adaptation mea-
sures will impose a heavy burden on their national economies.
There is evidence that flooding is likely to become a larger
problem in many temperate and humid regions, requiring adap-
tations not only to droughts and chronic water shortages but
also to floods and associated damages, raising concerns about
dam and levee failures.

"Inland aquatic ecosystems will be influenced by climate
change through altered water temperatures, flow regimes,
water levels, and thawing of permafrost at high latitudes. In
lakes and streams, warming would have the greatest biological
effects at high latitudes—where biological productivity would
increase and lead to expansion of cool-water species’ ranges—
and at the low-latitude boundaries of cold- and cool-water
species ranges, where extinctions would be greatest. Increases
in flow variability, particularly the frequency and duration of
large floods and droughts, would tend to reduce water quality,
biological productivity, and habitat in streams. The geographi-
cal distribution of wetlands is likely to shift with changes in
temperature and precipitation, with uncertain implications for
net greenhouse gas emissions from non-tidal wetlands. Some
coastal ecosystems (saltwater marshes, mangrove ecosystems,
coastal wetlands, coral reefs, coral atolls, and river deltas) are
particularly at risk from climate change and other stresses.
Changes in these ecosystems would have major negative
effects on freshwater supplies, fisheries, biodiversity, and
tourism.

"Climate change is projected to occur at a rapid rate relative to
the speed at which forest species grow, reproduce, and reestab-
lish themselves (past tree species’ migration rates are believed
to be on the order of 4-200 km per century). For mid-latitude
regions, an average warming of 1-3.5°C over the next 100
years would be equivalent to a poleward shift of the present
geographic bands of similar temperatures (or “isotherms”)
approximately 150-550 km, or an altitude shift of about
150-550 m. Therefore, the species composition of forests is
likely to change; in some regions, entire forest types may dis-
appear, while new assemblages of species and hence new
ecosystems may be established. As a consequence of possible
changes in temperature and water availability under doubled
equivalent-CO, equilibrium conditions, a substantial fraction
(a global average of one-third, varying by region from one-sev-
enth to two-thirds) of the existing forested area of the world
likely would undergo major changes in broad vegetation
types—with the greatest changes occurring in high latitudes
and the least in the tropics. In tropical rangelands, major alter-

marine fisheries production is expected to remain about the

that natural climate variability and the structure and strength of
ocean currents remain about the same. The principal impacts
will be felt at the national and local levels, as centers of pro-
duction shift. The positive effects of climate change—such as
longer growing seasons, lower natural winter mortality, and
faster growth rates in higher latitudes—may be offset by nega-

"In regions where agriculture is well adapted to current climate
variability and/or where market and institutional factors are in
place to redistribute agricultural surpluses to make up for short-
falls, vulnerability to changes in climate means and extremes
generally is low. However, in regions where agriculture is
unable to cope with existing extremes, where markets and insti-
tutions to facilitate redistribution of deficits and surpluses are
not in place, and/or where adaptation resources are limited, the
vulnerability of the agricultural sector to climate change should
be considered high. Other factors also will influence the vul-
nerability of agricultural production in a particular country or
region to climate change—including the extent to which current
temperatures or precipitation patterns are close to or exceed tol-
erance limits for important crops; per capita income; the per-

"Currently, 800 million people are malnourished; as the world’s
population increases and incomes in some countries rise, food
consumption is expected to double over the next three to four
decades. The most recent doubling in food production
occurred over a 25-year period and was based on irrigation,
chemical inputs, and high-yielding crop varieties. Whether the
remarkable gains of the past 25 years will be repeated is
uncertain: Problems associated with intensifying production
on land already in use (e.g., chemical and biological runoff,
waterlogging and salinization of soils, soil erosion and com-
paction) are becoming increasingly evident. Expanding the
amount of land under cultivation (including reducing land
deliberately taken out of production to reduce agricultural out-
put) also is an option for increasing total crop production, but
it could lead to increases in competition for land and pressure
on natural ecosystems, increased agricultural emissions of
greenhouse gases, a reduction in natural sinks of carbon, and
expansion of agriculture to marginal lands—all of which
could undermine the ability to sustainably support increased
agricultural production.

"Given the many forces bringing profound changes to the agri-
cultural sector, adaptation options that enhance resilience to
current natural climate variability and potential changes in
means and extremes and address other concerns (e.g., soil ero-
sion, salinization) offer no- or low-regret options. For example,
linking agricultural management to seasonal climate predic-
tions can assist in incremental adaptation, particularly in
regions where climate is strongly affected by ENSO condi-
tions. The suitability of these options for different regions
varies, in part because of differences in the financial and insti-
tutional ability of the private sector and governments in differ-
ent regions to implement them. Adaptation options include
changes in crops and crop varieties, development of new crop
varieties, changes in planting schedules and tillage practices,
introduction of new biotechnologies, and improved water-
management and irrigation systems, which have high capital
costs and are limited by availability of water resources. Other
options, such as minimum- and reduced-tillage technologies,
do not require such extensive capitalization but do require high
levels of agricultural training and support.

"Changes in climate will interact with stresses that result from
actions to increase agricultural production, affecting crop
yields and productivity in different ways, depending on the
types of agricultural practices and systems in place. The main
direct effects will be through changes in factors such as tem-
perature, precipitation, length of growing season, and timing of
extreme or critical threshold events relative to crop develop-
ment, as well as through changes in atmospheric CO, concen-
tration (which may have a beneficial effect on the growth of
many crop types). Indirect effects will include potentially detri-
mental changes in diseases, pests, and weeds, the effects of
which have not yet been quantified in most available studies.
Evidence continues to support the findings of the IPCC SAR
that “global agricultural production could be maintained rela-
tive to baseline production” for a growing population under
2xCO, equilibrium climate conditions. In addition, the region-
al findings of this special report lend support to concerns over
the “potential serious consequences” of increased risk of
hunger in some regions, particularly the tropics and subtropics.
Generally, middle to high latitudes may experience increases in
productivity, depending on crop type, growing season, changes
in temperature regimes, and the seasonality of precipitation. In
the tropics and subtropics—where some crops are near their
maximum temperature tolerance and where dryland, nonirri-
gated agriculture predominates—yields are likely to decrease.
The livelihoods of subsistence farmers and pastoral peoples,
who make up a large portion of rural populations in some
regions, also could be negatively affected. In regions where
there is a likelihood of decreased rainfall, agriculture could be
significantly affected.

IPCC Working Group I estimates for 2100) in the absence of
adaptation measures. A growing number of extremely large
cities are located in coastal areas, which means that large

0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP)—the average annual

"Climate change could affect human health through increases in

Compared with the total burden of ill health, these problems
are not likely to be large. In the aggregate, however, the direct
and indirect impacts of climate change on human health do
constitute a hazard to human population health, especially in
developing countries in the tropics and subtropics; these
impacts have considerable potential to cause significant loss of
life, affect communities, and increase health-care costs and lost
work days. Model projections (which entail necessary simpli-
fying assumptions) indicate that the geographical zone of
potential malaria transmission would expand in response to
global mean temperature increases at the upper part of the
IPCC-projected range (3-5°C by 2100), increasing the affect-
ed proportion of the world’s population from approximately
45% to approximately 60% by the latter half of the next centu-
ry. Areas where malaria is currently endemic could experience
intensified transmission (on the order of 50~80 million addi-
tional annual cases, relative to an estimated global background
total of 500 million cases). Some increases in non-vector-borne
infectious diseases—such as salmonellosis, cholera, and giar-

and increased flooding. However, quantifying the projected
health impacts is difficult because the extent of climate-

is subsidized, encouraging over-use (which draws down exist-

disaster insurance, which encourage infrastructure develop-

brought about through a range of approaches, including
strengthening legal and institutional frameworks, removing
preexisting market distortions (e.g., subsidies), correcting mar-

Changes in climate will interact with these underlying changes

because alterations to soils, plants, and ecosystems are very
likely, and there may be increases in fire occurrence and insect
outbreaks. Many species will be able to adapt, but in some
instances, a reduction of species diversity is highly likely. Any
changes will occur in a landscape already fragmented by agri-
cultural and urban development; such changes will add to
existing problems such as land degradation, weeds, and pest
infestations. Impacts on aquatic ecosystems from changes in
tiver flow, flood frequency, and nutrient and sediment inputs
are likely to be greatest in the drier parts of the region. Coastal
ecosystems are vulnerable to the impacts of sea-level rise and
possible changes in local meteorology. Tropical coral reefs,
including the Great Barrier Reef, may be able to keep pace
with sea-level rise—but will be vulnerable to bleaching and
death of corals induced by episodes of higher sea temperatures

able, and production increases are likely in some cases. However,
there may be a trend toward increased vulnerability in the
longer term—especially in warmer and more water-limited
parts of Australia, where initial gains for some crops are eroded
later as the delayed full effects of climate change (e.g., changes
in temperature and precipitation) tend to outweigh the more
immediate benefits of increased atmospheric CO, concentra-

to crop. There will be changes in growth and quality of crops
and pastures; shifts in the suitability of districts for particular
crops; and possibly increased problems with weeds, pests, and
diseases. Rangeland pastoralism and irrigated agriculture will
be especially affected where rainfall changes occur. Changes in
food production elsewhere in the world, which affect prices,
would have major economic impacts on the region. With regard
to forestry, the longer time to maturity results in a relatively
large exposure to financial loss from extreme events, fire, or

likely expand into tundra regions, reducing the extent of tun-

climate zones at rates faster than migration speeds. High-
elevation ecosystems and species are particularly vulnerable
because they have nowhere to migrate. An increase in temper-

to a substantial reduction in peat formation in Fennoscandian

"Conclusions: The major impacts in Temperate Asia under glob-
al climate change are projected to be large shifts of the boreal
forests, the disappearance of significant portions of mountain
glaciers, and water supply shortages. The most critical uncer-
tainty in these estimates stems from the lack of credible projec-
tions of the hydrological cycle under global climate change sce-
narios. The effects of climate change on the Asian monsoon and
the ENSO phenomenon are among the major uncertainties in
the modeling of the hydrological cycle. Projections of agricul-
tural crop yields are uncertain, not only because of the uncer-
tainty in the hydrological cycle but also because of the potential
positive effects of CO, and production practices. Sea-level rise
endangers sandy beaches in the coastal zones, but remains an
anthropogenically induced problem in delta areas. Integrated
impact studies considering multi-stress factors are needed.

increase in production associated with CO, fertilization will be
more than offset by reductions in yield from temperature or

result in significant changes in crop yields, production, storage,
and distribution, the net effect of the changes regionwide is
uncertain because of varietal differences; local differences in

"Ecosystems: Substantial elevational shifts of ecosystems in the
mountains and uplands of Tropical Asia are projected. At high
elevation, weedy species can be expected to displace tree
species—though the rates of vegetation change could be slow
compared to the rate of climate change and constrained by
increased erosion in the Greater Himalayas. Changes in the dis-
tribution and health of rainforest and drier monsoon forest will
be complex. In Thailand, for instance, the area of tropical for-
est could increase from 45% to 80% of total forest cover,
whereas in Sri Lanka, a significant increase in dry forest and a
decrease in wet forest could occur. Projected increases in evapo-
transpiration and rainfall variability are likely to have a nega-
tive impact on the viability of freshwater wetlands, resulting in
shrinkage and desiccation. Sea-level rise and increases in sea-
surface temperature are the most probable major climate
change-related stresses on coastal ecosystems. Coral reefs may
be able to keep up with the rate of sea-level rise but suffer
bleaching from higher temperatures. Landward migration of
mangroves and tidal wetlands is expected to be constrained by
human infrastructure and human activities.

"Hydrology and Water Resources: The Himalayas have a criti-
cal role in the provision of water to continental monsoon Asia.
Increased temperatures and increased seasonal variability in
precipitation are expected to result in increased recession of
glaciers and increasing danger from glacial lake outburst
floods. A reduction in average flow of snow-fed rivers, coupled
with an increase in peak flows and sediment yield, would have
major impacts on hydropower generation, urban water supply,
and agriculture. Availability of water from snow-fed rivers may
increase in the short term but decrease in the long run. Runoff
from rain-fed rivers may change in the future. A reduction in
snowmelt water will put the dry-season flow of these rivers
under more stress than is the case now. Increased population
and increasing demand in the agricultural, industrial, and
hydropower sectors will put additional stress on water
resources. Pressure on the drier river basins and those subject
to low seasonal flows will be most acute. Hydrological changes
in island and coastal drainage basins are expected to be rela-
tively small in comparison to those in continental Tropical
Asia, apart from those associated with sea-level rise.

"Human Health: Heat-stress mortality and illness (predomi-

heat waves under climate-change conditions projected by a
transient GCM (GFDL X2, UKMO X6). Net climate change-
related increases in the geographic distribution (elevation and
latitude) of the vector organisms of infectious diseases (e.g.,
malarial mosquitoes, schistosome-spreading snails) and
changes in the life-cycle dynamics of vectors and infective par-
asites would, in aggregate, increase the potential transmission
of many vector-borne diseases. Increases in nonvector-borne
infectious diseases—such as cholera, salmonellosis, and other
food- and water-related infections—also could occur because
of climatic impacts on water distribution, temperature, and
microorganism proliferation. Disease surveillance could be
strengthened and integrated with other environmental moni-
toring to design early warning systems; develop early, envi-
ronmentally sound public health interventions; and develop
anticipatory societal policies to reduce the risk of outbreaks

"Conclusions: The potential direct effects of climate change
assessed here, such as changes in water availability, crop yields,
and inundation of coastal areas, all will have further indirect
effects on food security and human health. The suitability of
adaptation strategies to different climatic environments will
vary across the diverse subregions and land uses of the region.
Adaptive options include new temperature- and pest-resistant
crop varieties; new technologies to reduce crop yield loss;
improvements in irrigation efficiency; and integrated approach-
es to river basin and coastal zone management that take account
of current and longer-term issues, including climate change.

"Coastal Systems: Coastal lands are particularly vulnerable; sea-
level rise is the most obvious climate-related impact. Densely
settled and intensively used low-lying coastal plains, islands,
and deltas are especially vulnerable to coastal erosion and land
loss, inundation and sea flooding, upstream movement of the
saline/freshwater front, and seawater intrusion into freshwater
lenses. Especially at risk are large delta regions of Bangladesh,
Myanmar, Viet Nam, and Thailand, and the low-lying areas of
Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia. Socioeconomic
impacts could be felt in major cities and ports, tourist resorts,
artisinal and commercial fishing, coastal agriculture, and infra-
structure development. International studies have projected the
displacement of several millions of people from the region’s
coastal zone, assuming a 1-m rise in sea level. The costs of
response measures to reduce the impact of sea-level rise in the
region could be immense.

"Human Health: The incidence and extent of some vector-borne
diseases are expected to increase with global warming. Malaria,
schistosomiasis, and dengue—which are significant causes of
mortality and morbidity in Tropical Asia—are very sensitive to
climate and are likely to spread into new regions on the margins
of presently endemic areas as a consequence of climate change.
Newly affected populations initially would experience higher
fatality rates. According to one study that specifically focused
on climate influences on infectious disease in presently vulner-
able regions, an increase in epidemic potential of 12-27% for
malaria and 31-47% for dengue and a decrease of schistosomi-
asis of 11-17% are anticipated under a range of GCM scenarios
as a consequence of climate change. Waterborne and water-
related infectious diseases, which already account for the
majority of epidemic emergencies in the region, also are expect-
ed to increase when higher temperatures and higher humidity
are superimposed on existing conditions and projected increas-
es in population, urbanization, declining water quality, and
other trends.

"In making use of the SAR, the UNFCCC negotiators found a
need for more explicit information on how different regions of
the world might be affected, to better assess their degrees of
vulnerability. Accordingly, the Subsidiary Body for Scientific
and Technological Advice (SBSTA) of the UNFCCC request-
ed that the IPCC prepare a report that provided a geographi-
cally explicit view of the problem, particularly the vulnerabili-
ties for each region. Initially, a Technical Paper was planned
(which, under the IPCC rules of procedure, limited the authors
to citing only material included in the SAR), but in September
1996 the IPCC XIIth Plenary at Mexico City decided that a
Special Report should be produced. This decision was taken to
allow the inclusion and proper review of new material post-
dating the SAR—especially new work emerging from several
country studies programs, as well as regional studies which
were not included in the SAR due to its global scope.

"The foundation for policy formulation for the climate change
problem is scientific information on greenhouse gas emissions,
the climate system and how it may change, and the likely
impacts on human activities and the environment. To provide
the best available base of scientific information for policymak-
ers and public use, governments have requested that the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) periodical-
ly assess and summarize the current scientific literature related
to climate change. The most recent assessment is the Second
Assessment Report (SAR), a comprehensive three-volume
report completed in 1995 and published in 1996. This assess-
ment involved extensive inputs from thousands of scientists and
was reviewed by governments and leading experts. The SAR
takes a global view of the impacts of climate change, organiz-
ing chapters by ecosystem type or socioeconomic sector (e.g.,
forests, grasslands, agriculture, and industry).

"Worldwide concern about possible climate change and acceler-
ation of sea-level rise resulting from increasing concentrations
of greenhouse gases has led governments to consider interna-
tional action to address the issue, particularly through the
development of the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC). Because the extent and urgency
of action required to mitigate the source of the problem—
namely the emission of greenhouse gases by human activi-
ties—depends on the level of vulnerability, a key question for
the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the Convention, and for
policymakers in general, is the degree to which human condi-
tions and the natural environment are vulnerable to the poten-
tial effects of climate change. Impact assessments are needed
to establish the costs and benefits of climatic change as a guide
to what adaptation and mitigation measures might be justified.
Without such assessments, we run the risk of making unin-
formed, unwise, and perhaps unnecessarily costly decisions.

"This report should be read as an assessment of the scientific
and technical literature related to the sensitivity, adaptability,
and vulnerability of ecosystems and social and economic sec-
tors in the 10 regions—not as a quantitative integrated assess-
ment of impacts. The approach used in preparing the assess-
ment was agreed by the lead authors at a series of scoping
meetings held in Washington, DC, in May and September
1996, which set the direction of the assessment when it was
being prepared as a technical paper. These meetings were used
to review materials from the sectoral assessments of the SAR
and organize them into regional analyses, and to identify com-
mon issues across the regions and standardize approaches to
addressing them. After the paper was reprogrammed as a spe-
cial report, a series of chapter-specific regional consultations
and meetings of lead authors and other experts was held to
refine the scope of each regional assessment and to identify
studies and methods to use in addition to those used in the
SAR. These meetings were held in Toronto, Canada (13-15
January 1997); New Delhi, India (23-25 January 1997);
Harare, Zimbabwe (27-29 January 1997); Tarawa, Kiribati
(10-13 February 1997); Montevideo, Uruguay (11-13
February 1997); and Amsterdam, The Netherlands (19-21
March 1997).
"	Text
"On the basis of these meetings, the lead authors set about
preparing each chapter to provide an assessment of the vul-
nerability of natural ecosystems, socioeconomic sectors, and
human health in the region. The definition of vulnerability
used in the SAR was adopted for use by the lead authors in
this report: “Vulnerability” is the extent to which climate
change may damage or harm a system; it is a function of both
the “sensitivity” of a system or structure to climate and the
opportunities for “adaptation” to new conditions. Sensitivity
is defined as the degree to which a system will respond to a
change in climatic conditions (e.g., the extent of change in
ecosystem composition, structure, and functioning, including
primary productivity, resulting from a given change in tem-
perature or precipitation). The responses may result in either
beneficial or harmful effects. Adaptation is defined as adjust-
ments in practices, processes, or structures in response to pro-
jected or actual changes in climate. Adjustments can be either
spontaneous or planned, reactive or anticipatory. In some
cases (e.g., for many ecosystems), options for planned or
anticipatory adaptation may not exist. Adaptations can reduce
negative impacts or take advantage of new opportunities pre-
sented by changing climate conditions. It is in part because of
the uncertainties associated with regional projections of cli-
mate change (these uncertainties are summarized in Section
1.3.2. and described more fully in Annex B) that this report

"Many impacts studies use model simulations for the equilibri-
um climatic response to a carbon dioxide (CO,) doubling,
rather than more recent model simulations of climate change
resulting from gradually increasing CO, concentrations and
changing concentrations of aerosols and stratospheric ozone.
Thus the level of warming used in many of the impacts studies
may not be reached until several decades after 2100, rather
than by that date. However, this does not necessarily mean that
all impacts will be slowed; for example, the transient simula-
tions exhibit larger land-sea temperature change contrasts, and
this would be expected to alter atmospheric circulation and
weather patterns in ways not predicted in the equilibrium sim-
ulations. Historical observations of the impacts of weather pat-
terns—including droughts, floods, storms, and other extreme
weather events—suggest that changes in climate variability
could have important impacts on natural and social systems.

"This report is based upon evidence found in the published liter-
ature, which uses a diverse range of methods and models. This
diversity reflects current uncertainties regarding the functioning
of complex natural and social systems and how they respond to
changes in climate. The assessment did not include the perfor-
mance of new research or computer model simulations by the
authors to estimate impacts under common scenarios of green-
house gas emissions or climate change. Such work was beyond
the scope of the report. Because the available studies have not
employed a common set of climate scenarios, and because of
uncertainties regarding the sensitivity and adaptability of natur-
al and social systems, the assessment of regional vulnerabilities
is necessarily qualitative. Often only very general conclusions
can be supported by the currently available evidence. In a num-
ber of instances, quantitative estimates of impacts of climate
change are cited in the report. Such estimates are strongly
dependent upon the specific assumptions made and models
used. These estimates should not be interpreted as predictions of
the most likely impacts, but rather as illustrations of the poten-
tial character and magnitude of impacts that may result from
specific scenarios of climate change.

"In the IPCC’s second assessment (1996, WG I, Chapter 6),
seven regions were identified for regional analysis of climate
simulations. That analysis was based on transient runs with
atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs)
suitable for construction of regional climate scenarios, using
additional regionalization techniques to improve the simula-
tion of regional climate change. The team of lead authors that
conducted that analysis, led by F. Giorgi and G. Meehl, pre-
pared information on the simulation of regional climate
change with global coupled climate models and regional
modeling techniques for use by the regional assessment
teams. That information, which is presented in Annex B of
this report, is based entirely on the information included in
the WG I contribution to the SAR. No new information has
been added to the previous analysis.

"“Analysis of surface air temperature and precipitation
results from regional climate change experiments carried
out with AOGCMs indicates that the biases in present-day
simulations of regional climate change and the inter-model
variability in the simulated regional changes are still too
large to yield a high level of confidence in simulated change
scenarios. The limited number of experiments available
with statistical downscaling techniques and nested regional
models has shown that complex topographical features,
large lake systems, and narrow land masses not resolved at
the resolution of current GCMs significantly affect the sim-
ulated regional and local change scenarios, both for precip-
itation and (to a lesser extent) temperature (IPCC, 1996).
This adds a further degree of uncertainty in the use of
GCM-produced scenarios for impact assessments. In addi-
tion, most climate change experiments have not accounted
for human-induced landscape changes and only recently
has the effect of aerosols been investigated. Both these fac-
tors can further affect projections of regional climate
change.”

"The review chapters in this report summarize impact studies
based on a range of climate scenarios where they were avail-
able. Most studies were based on the older, mixed-layer GCM
climate scenarios; results from coupled transient models have
only recently become available, and studies using these sce-
narios are only beginning to be conducted. The older GCM
runs estimate stable equilibrium conditions for 1xCO, and
2xCO, climates and generally show more global mean warm-
ing than recent transient model runs (see Table 1-1 for a list of
equilibrium scenarios used in studies assessed in this special
report). In the transient model runs (see Table 1-2 for a listing
of transient scenarios cited), in which trace gases increase
slowly over a period of years, the full effects of changes in
temperature and precipitation lag the effects of changes in
atmospheric composition by a number of decades. Thus, in
impact studies using transient scenarios (e.g., model studies of
potential climate change impacts on vegetation distribution),
the positive effects of CO, on plant growth and other variables
dependent upon plant production precede the full effects of
changes in climate.

"Several climate regimes characterize the African continent; the
wet tropical, dry tropical, and alternating wet and dry climates
are the most common. Many countries on the continent are
prone to recurrent droughts; some drought episodes, particu-
larly in southeast Africa, are associated with El Nino-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) phenomena. Deterioration in terms of
trade, inappropriate policies, high population growth rates, and
lack of significant investment—coupled with a highly variable
climate—have made it difficult for several countries to devel-
op patterns of livelihood that would reduce pressure on the nat-
ural resource base. Under the assumption that access to ade-

"Coastal Systems: Several African coastal zones—many of
which already are under stress from population pressure and
conflicting uses—would be adversely affected by sea-level
rise associated with climate change. The coastal nations of
west and central Africa (e.g., Senegal, The Gambia, Sierra
Leone, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, Angola) have low-lying
lagoonal coasts that are susceptible to erosion and hence are
threatened by sea-level rise, particularly because most of the
countries in this area have major and rapidly expanding cities
on the coast. The west coast often is buffeted by storm surges
and currently is at risk from erosion, inundation, and extreme
storm events. The coastal zone of east Africa also will be
affected, although this area experiences calm conditions
through much of the year. However, sea-level rise and climat-
ic variation may reduce the buffer effect of coral and patch
reefs along the east coast, increasing the potential for erosion.

"Agriculture and Food Security: Except in the oil-exporting
countries, agriculture is the economic mainstay in most African
countries, contributing 20-30% of gross domestic product
(GDP) in sub-Saharan Africa and 55% of the total value of
African exports. In most African countries, farming depends
entirely on the quality of the rainy season—a situation that
makes Africa particularly vulnerable to climate change.
Increased droughts could seriously impact the availability of
food, as in the Horn of Africa and southern Africa during the
1980s and 1990s. A rise in mean winter temperatures also
would be detrimental to the production of winter wheat and
fruits that need the winter chill. However, in subtropical Africa,
warmer winters would reduce the incidence of damaging
frosts, making it possible to grow horticultural produce sus-
ceptible to frosts at higher elevations than is possible at pre-
sent. Productivity of freshwater fisheries may increase,
although the mix of fish species could be altered. Changes in
ocean dynamics could lead to changes in the migratory patterns
of fish and possibly to reduced fish landings, especially in
coastal artisinal fisheries.

"Ecosystems: In Africa today, tropical forests and rangelands are
under threat from population pressures and systems of land use.
Generally apparent effects of these threats include loss of biodi-
versity, rapid deterioration in land cover, and depletion of water
availability through destruction of catchments and aquifers.
Changes in climate will interact with these underlying changes
in the environment, adding further stresses to a deteriorating sit-
uation. A sustained increase in mean ambient temperatures
beyond 1°C would cause significant changes in forest and range-
land cover; species distribution, composition, and migration pat-
terns; and biome distribution. Many organisms in the deserts
already are near their tolerance limits, and some may not be able
to adapt further under hotter conditions. Arid to semi-arid sub-
regions and the grassland areas of eastern and southern Africa,
as well as areas currently under threat from land degradation and
desertification, are particularly vulnerable. Were rainfall to
increase as projected by some general circulation models
(GCMs) in the highlands of east Africa and equatorial central
Africa, marginal lands would become more productive than they
are now. These effects are likely to be negated, however, by pop-
ulation pressure on marginal forests and rangelands. Adaptive
options include control of deforestation, improved rangeland
management, expansion of protected areas, and sustainable man-

Individuals living in marginal areas may be forced to migrate
to urban areas (where infrastructure already is approaching its
limits as a result of population pressure) if the marginal lands
become less productive under new climate conditions. Climate
change could worsen current trends in depletion of biomass
energy resources. Reduced stream flows would cause reduc-
tions in hydropower production, leading to negative effects on
industrial productivity and costly relocation of some industrial
plants. Management of pollution, sanitation, waste disposal,
water supply, and public health, as well as provision of ade-

low per capita fossil energy use and hence low greenhouse

change because widespread poverty limits capabilities to
adapt. The ultimate socioeconomic impacts of climate
change will depend on the relative resilience and adaptation
abilities of different social groups. In general, the commer-
cial sector and high-income households in communal areas
are better equipped to adjust adequately and in a timely fash-
ion. Much will depend on the coping abilities and mecha-
nisms used by governments and households over the next 50
years or so. Such abilities are determined by political stew-
ardships. If the region manages to achieve reasonable eco-

"This chapter focuses on the potential impacts of climate change
on ecosystems, natural resources, and various socioeconomic
sectors of mainland Africa. To the extent permitted by the lit-
erature, it describes the functions and current status of a num-
ber of key resource sectors and ecosystems; the ways in which
these systems would respond to changes in climatic conditions;
options for adaptation to projected changes in climate; and the
vulnerability of each system or sector, taking into account
adaptation options as well as impediments to their implemen-
tation. Downing (1992, 1996) suggests that vulnerability is an
aggregate measure of human welfare that integrates environ-
mental, social, economic, and political exposure to a range of
potentially harmful perturbations or threats. Vulnerability
varies spatially and temporally for different communities,
although they may face the same risk (Eele, 1996). Feasible
strategies for coping with future climate changes therefore
must be rooted in a full understanding of the complex structure
and causes of present-day social vulnerability, through an
understanding of vulnerability to climatic variability on sea-
sonal to interannual time scales.

"The African continent encompasses a rich mosaic of ecologi-
cal settings. Together these ecosystems harbor a wealth of
economically and biologically important resources, from
individual species to productive habitats (Huq et al., 1996).
One quarter of Africa is hyper-arid desert; one third is in the
humid climate zone; and the remainder of the continent is
dryland, consisting of arid, semi-arid, and dry subhumid
areas (UNEP, 1992). These drylands are home to about 400
million people—two-thirds of the continent’s total popula-
tion. Recurrent droughts have long been a permanent feature
of life throughout the drylands of Africa. Over the past 30
years or so, however, unusually severe and/or prolonged
droughts in these drylands have seriously affected agriculture
and wildlife and caused many deaths and severe malnutrition.
In some areas, desertification has accompanied these
droughts, although the processes leading to desertification are
much more varied than climate alone. Currently, 36 countries
in Africa are affected by recurrent drought and some degree
of desertification (UNEP, 1992). The risk of drought is high-
est in the Sudano-Sahelian belt and in southern Africa
(Nicholson et al., 1988).

Uganda—tural population makes up more than 80% of the
total. Agriculture is the fundamental economic activity in these
countries; although it accounts on average for only about
20-30% of GDP, agriculture contributes the largest share of

better prepare African societies for efficient, sustainable
management of the continent’s fragile resources. In

"African economies have made relatively low levels of
investment in infrastructure and directly productive
capital goods—and hence continue to rely heavily on
natural capital (natural resources). This natural capital
is at risk because poverty and high population growth
often induce land degradation and deforestation—
which in turn lead to growing food insecurity and loss
of biodiversity. This pattern contributes to migration
into rural areas that often are less suitable for agricul-
tural expansion and to urban areas with inappropriate
physical, social, and economic infrastructure. The
process also contributes to population growth by creat-
ing an incentive for large families: Adding family labor
becomes one way of coping with the increasing time
costs of gathering fuel and water and clearing new
land. The severity of this population-agriculture-
environment nexus is compounded by low investment
in human capital (human resource development), which
often restricts individuals to continued reliance on
unskilled labor and short-term exploitation of natural
resources (the land) as the only feasible survival
options.

"Of the 30 poorest countries of the world, 22 are African (World
Bank, 1996). The average income level in sub-Saharan Africa
in 1993 was $520 per capita, and the average growth rate per
capita was negative (-0.8% per year from 1980 to 1993). By
the year 2000, the number of poor in Africa is projected to
increase to an estimated 265 million—which would represent
more than 40% of the continent’s population (World Bank,
1990). In Africa, poverty is linked to the environment in com-
plex ways, particularly in economies that are based on
exploitation of natural resources. Degradation of these
resources reduces the productivity of poor persons, who most
tely on them, and makes poor communities even more suscep-
tible to extreme events (whether meteorological, economic, or
political in origin) (World Bank, 1996). Poverty is exacerbated
by a demographic profile that continues to record an annual
population growth rate of just under 3%, the highest in the
world (WRI, 1994). As a result, the population in many African
countries will continue to double every 20 to 30 years, well
into the 21st century. However, the high incidence of incurable
diseases—such as malaria, human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV), and hepatitis B—may modify this estimate.

"Cultivated land per capita varies considerably across the conti-
nent, reflecting the uneven distribution of population (for exam-
ple, low density in the Congo basin but high in the east African
Highlands) as well as low levels of technology and the unsuit-
ability of wide areas for farming. Dependence on shifting culti-
vation makes the area needed for cropland high. Scarcity of good
land, coupled with soil degradation and low levels of inputs and
technology, results in increasing deficits in food production. The
predominance of rain-fed subsistence agriculture and, across
southern Africa, overdependence on (water-demanding) maize
has helped ensure that food security for most of the continent is
inextricably linked to the quality of each rainy season. In dryland
regions, crop and livestock production are extremely susceptible
to seasonal rainfall variability and, as a result, have shown con-
siderable volatility in recent years. Drought shock, however,
extends well beyond the confines of agriculture (crop) and live-
stock production, partly because of the important roles these two
sectors play in the overall economies of many African states.
Crop and livestock production are major employers and make
significant contributions to GDP and export earnings. They also
are major sources of raw materials for industries such as textiles,
food processing, and fuel refining. On the other hand, they are
major markets for other industries such as machinery, animal
feeds, fuel, and fertilizer producers (Gibberd et al., 1996).

demarcate the tropics from the subtropics. Rainfall in the sub-
tropics is modulated by mid-latitude storms, which may be dis-
placed Equator-ward in winter. Further modification of these
broad patterns is provided by natural features such as lakes and
mountains, and by the influence of ocean currents. The pole-
ward extremes of the continent have extratropical influences
associated with mid-latitude synoptic disturbances, resulting in
significant winter rainfall (Griffiths, 1972).

"In general, surface air temperatures over most of Africa display
a high degree of thermal uniformity, spatially and seasonally
(Riehl, 1979). The extreme north and south of the continent,
however, experience cold frontal systems that quasi-regularly
introduce abrupt air mass changes. Temperatures there are
more variable in response to a large annual cycle of insolation
and the effects of seasonally varying air masses and winds.
Mean temperature trends over the past 100 years, averaged
over continental Africa, are shown in Figure 2-2. The highland
areas of eastern and southern Africa are substantially cooler
than lowland regions, and there is evidence that recent warm-
ing trends may have been exaggerated in these mountain areas
(Hulme, 1996a).

"Most policymakers now recognize drought as a normal feature
of Africa’s climate and acknowledge that its recurrence is
inevitable. Widespread occurrences of severe drought during
the past three decades have repeatedly underscored the vul-
nerability of developed and developing societies to its ravages
in Africa. Although the variability of African climate is
inevitable, loss of human life and economic disruption associ-
ated with extreme climatic fluctuation can be lessened by
advance warning. Recent scientific advances in understanding
the climate system and breakthroughs in predictive capabili-
ties on seasonal time scales provide an opportunity to reduce
the vulnerability of human societies by planning for previous-
ly unexpected variations from mean climatic conditions.
Current forecasting capabilities, although by no means per-
fect, provide a better indication of climatic conditions that are
expected to prevail during the next season or two than simply
assuming that rainfall and temperature will be normal

"Numerous schemes have been used to describe Africa’s vegeta-
tion and ecosystems. White’s (1983) classification system is
used here, aggregated (after Justice et al., 1994) to show the
rainforest in central Africa (unmarked) and two major cate-
goties of woodland savannas divided by moisture and nutrient
level: broad-leafed, nutrient-poor, moist savannas; and fine-
leafed, nutrient-rich, arid savannas (Figure 2-5). This aggrega-
tion summarizes current understanding of the role of soil nutri-
ents and moisture on vegetation distribution in Africa, especial-
ly in savannas (Scholes and Walker, 1993). The broad-leafed
savannas include the extensive miombo woodlands of central
and southern Africa. Nutritionally poor soils support only low-
quality grass for grazing, so the numbers of large herbivores is
low in miombo and other broad-leafed savannas (Frost, 1996).
The fine-leafed savannas include acacia-dominated thorn
woodlands, which have higher-quality grass and so support
large numbers of large herbivores; these areas constitute the
main rangeland region.

increase by 5—10% by 2050. Little can be said yet about changes in climate variability or extreme events in Africa.

"The amount of water available to plants over the course of the
year affects plant growth and location across soil and climate
types. Available soil water (in combination, of course, with other
factors) generally controls the growth cycle (beginning and end)
and other events such as when to leaf, shed leaves, set buds, and
so forth. Water availability and temperature indices and parame-
ters (maxima and minima, heat sums, cold sums) have been used
to relate the distribution of vegetation formations to climatic fac-
tors (for more details on these plant biogeography models, see
Section 2.3.1.4). However, large uncertainties in GCM precipi-

responses to changes in climate. Thus, improving climate mod-

"Changes in sea level and climate in Africa might be expected by the year 2050. Hernes et al. (1995) project a sea-level
rise of about 25 cm. There will be subregional and local differences around the coast of Africa in this average sea-level
rise—depending on ocean currents, atmospheric pressure, and natural land movements—but 25 cm by 2050 is a general-
ly accepted figure (Joubert and Tyson, 1996). For Africa south of the Equator, simulated changes in mean sea-level pres-
sure produced by mixed-layer and fully coupled GCMs are small (~1 hPa)—smaller than present-day simulation errors
calculated for both types of models (Joubert and Tyson, 1996). Observed sea-level pressure anomalies of the same mag-
nitude as simulated changes are known to accompany major large-scale circulation adjustments associated with extended
wet and dry spells over the subcontinent.

"In most of Africa, water availability is projected to have
the greatest impact on plant processes. Individual species
are adapted to particular water regimes and may perform
poorly and possibly die out in conditions to which they are
poorly adapted (e.g., Hinckley et a/., 1981). The effects of
climate change will vary—depending, for example, on
how particular plant types use water (water-use efficiency,
WUE) or the amount of water available in the soil. Plants
are grouped into C3, Cy, and CAM plant types depending
on how the process of photosynthesis takes place (see
IPCC 1996, WG II, Section A.2.2). C, plants (which
include most trees and crop species such as wheat, rice,
barley, cassava, and potato) have relatively poor WUE,
unlike C, plants (most of the tropical grasses and agricul-
tural species such as maize, sugarcane, and sorghum).
Higher CO, concentration will likely improve water-use
efficiency and growth in C; plants in water-limited environ-
ments. C, and CAM plants (including desert plants such as
cacti) are unlikely to be affected directly by changes in CO,

"Rainfall changes projected by most GCMs are relatively modest, at least in relation to present-day rainfall variability. In
general, rainfall is projected to increase over the continent—the exceptions being southern Africa and parts of the Horn of
Africa; here, rainfall is projected to decline by 2050 by about 10%. Seasonal changes in rainfall are not expected to be
large; Joubert and Tyson (1996) found no evidence for a change in rainfall seasonality among a selection of mixed-layer and
fully coupled GCMs. Hewitson and Crane (1996) found evidence for slightly extended later summer season rainfall over
eastern South Africa (though nowhere else), based on a single mixed-layer model prediction. Great uncertainty exists, how-
ever, in relation to regional-scale rainfall changes simulated by GCMs (Joubert and Hewitson, 1997). Parts of the Sahel
could experience rainfall increases of as much as 15% over the 1961-90 average. Equatorial Africa could experience a
small (5%) increase in rainfall. These rainfall results are not consistent: Different climate models, or different simulations
with the same model, yield different patterns. The problem involves determining the character of the climate change signal
on African rainfall against a background of large natural variability compounded by the use of imperfect climate models.

younger and less leached and occur in regions of heavy rainfall,
so they are quite agriculturally productive. Nonlaterized red
earths, which are found in drier regions (e.g., savannas), are
good agricultural soils. Upland red earths are an immature
group that occasionally are intensively farmed. In regions of
moderate rainfall, the most fertile soils are located in the high
veld of southern Africa and parts of west Africa. The black
soils—the vertisols—are very fertile but become adhesive dur-

In arid regions, soil humus is very low; moisture often is drawn

coexist at a site while in competition with each other for light
and water. These models simulate the maximum carrying
capacity, or vegetation density (in the form of leaf area), that
can be supported at the site under the constraints of energy and
water. A change in leaf area can be interpreted as a change in
overall carrying capacity or standing crop of the site, regard-

"In geological time scales, forest boundaries fluctuated a great
deal during the Pleistocene epoch (Sayer et al., 1992); the
forests of Africa even now are considerably more extensive
than they were during the most recent high-latitude glacial
advance about 18,000 years ago. Environmental conditions in
tropical Africa at about 18,000 before present (BP) are quite
well known, thanks to a large number of pollen and plant
microfossil studies (see Hamilton, 1988, for more details).
During the severe arid period around 18,000 BP, core areas
(centers of biotic diversity) were the main centers of forest
survival. Two such principal core areas are located in
Cameroon/Gabon and eastern Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) (formerly Zaire); other, less-diverse core areas are in
west Africa and near the east African coast (Sayer et al.,

and endemics but also are centers of distribution of disjunct
species. Some of these species are unlikely to be able to dis-

cover. For example, gorillas are disjunctly distributed across

Desert air is very dry; incoming solar and outgoing terrestrial
radiation are intense, with large daily temperature fluctuations;
and potential evaporation is high. Many organisms in the
deserts already are near their tolerance limits (IPCC, 1996).
The Sahara in north Africa and the Namib desert in southwest
Africa are classified as the hottest deserts in the world—with
average monthly temperatures above 30°C during the warmest
months and extremes above 50°C. The diurnal temperature
range often is large; winter nights in the Namib Desert some-
times are as cold as 10°C (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 3.3.1) or
lower. Extreme desert systems already experience wide fluctu-
ations in rainfall and are adapted to coping with sequences of
extreme conditions. Initial changes associated with climate
change are less likely to create conditions significantly outside
present ranges of tolerance; desert biota show very specialized
adaptations to aridity and heat, such as obtaining their moisture

"From a land-use perspective, there are differences between west
Africa and east Africa in the way rangelands are used. In arid and
semi-arid areas of west Africa (rainfall 5600 mm), millet (or
another crop) is planted over a unimodal (one peak in rainfall per
year) rainy season (3-4 months); then fields remain fallow over
the 8- to 9-month dry season. Livestock eat crop residues. Land
use is dominated by cultivation, with livestock playing a sub-
sidiary role in the village economy (Ellis and Galvin, 1994), In
east Africa, by contrast, areas with higher rainfall (up to 600
mm) are inhabited by pastoral people rather than farmers. The
Ngisonyoka of northern Kenya, for example, are pastoral
nomads, completely dependent on their livestock for food, liveli-
hood, and life (Galvin, 1992). In dry parts of eastern Africa, cul-
tivation is uncommon and occurs mainly where irrigation is pos-
sible or where water can otherwise be sequestered and stored for
cropping (Ellis and Galvin, 1994). Rainfall is bimodal (two
peaks in rainfall per year) in most east African rangelands,
resulting in two plant-growing seasons. This pattern has impor-
tant implications for natural vegetation and rain-fed agriculture
(de Ridder et al., 1982). According to Ellis et al. (1987), Turkana
pastoralists in northern Kenya say that the best years for live-
stock production are not necessarily those with the greatest rain-
fall. Rather, years in which moderate rainfall extends over sev-
eral months, resulting in a long period of foliage production and
livestock milk production, are good years. Thus, the distribution
and timing of rainfall will be at least as important as total annu-
al amounts projected under climate change.

process models are more appropriate in analysis of this specif-

(Parton et al., 1992) ecosystem process model of plant-soil
interactions to analyze the impact of climate and atmospheric
CO, changes on grasslands of the world, including 7 of 31 sites
in Africa. Ojima et al. (1996) looked at the effects of increas-
ing CO, and climate, using climate change scenarios based on
the Canadian Climate Centre (CCC) and GFDL GCMs. They
found that changes in total plant productivity were positively
correlated to changes in precipitation and nitrogen mineraliza-
tion (with nitrogen mineralization the most important factor).
The response to nitrogen mineralization was consistent with
the general observation that grasslands respond positively to
addition of nitrogen fertilizer (Rains et al., 1975; Lauenroth
and Dodd, 1978). Plant responses to CO, were modified in
complex ways by moisture and nutrient availabilities; their
results generally indicated that CO, enrichment had a greater
effect with higher moisture stress. However, nutrient limita-
tions reduced CO, responses. Ojima et al. (1996) concluded
that increased atmospheric CO, will offset the negative effects
of periodic droughts, making grasslands more resilient to nat-
ural (and human-induced changes in) climate variability. The
strength of this beneficial effect, however, is controlled by the
availability of nitrogen and other nutrients, which tend to be
limited in many African landscapes.

landscape processes. The retreat of some glaciers on
Kilimanjaro and Mt. Kenya would have significant impacts on

of moderation of the seasonal flow regimes of rivers upstream.

model of arid rangeland degradation that suggests that degra-

Assisted management is a lot harder for wildlife in game
reserves than for livestock. Monitoring is required to identify
populations at risk (from deforestation), as well as reserved
areas that are changing their vegetation types in response to cli-
mate, leaving some animals in habitat types that are not suit-
able. Massive fragmentation of previous forests and woodlands
makes it difficult for wildlife to migrate along corridors to
areas with more water and foliage. Close monitoring would
identify groups of wildlife that are in danger, and steps can be
taken to move them to suitable habitat.

deterioration of forest cover already are being implemented to
some degree. Some of these measures involve natural respons-

programs (such as tree planting) designed to minimize undesir-
able impacts. These strategies will include careful monitoring
and microassessment of discreet impacts of climate change on
particular species. Low-latitude forest adaptation options, espe-
cially in west Africa, must include active vegetation and soil
management. For example, Gilbert et al. (1995) have indicated
that silvicultural practices, endangered species habitat manage-

Cameroon and Ghana. These adaptive measures will help

Adjustments in response to climate change would either
involve changes in water allocation or structural adjustments in

modeling effort over the Nile to help reduce this uncertainty. It
remains prudent to make capital investments in decreasing
water demand via more efficient irrigation management as a

"There is some concern that the negative impacts of climate
change on water supply could be larger (and the gains smaller)
than those reported in current assessments. Many GCMs have
not explicitly incorporated the influence of persistent drought in
evaluating the impact of global warming. In particular, equilib-
tium models begin each year with no model memory of ground-
water depletion in a preceding year. Yet the successive accumu-
lation of back-to-back drought years often can have devastating
effects on groundwater, runoff, reservoir storage, marginal agri-
cultural activities, and water quality (Cline, 1992).

"Higher temperatures would increase evaporative loss-
es, especially if rainfall also declined. Minor declines
in mean annual rainfall (10-20%) for extended periods
would lead to the closure of these basins even if tem-

1993). Tropical temperatures are increasing; tempera-
tures in the 1980s were 0.5°C warmer than a century
earlier and 0.3°C warmer than during the period
1951-1980. Concurrently, Lake Victoria’s epilimnion
was warmer by 0.5°C in the early 1990s than in the
1960s (Hecky et al., 1994). Although current climate

"Recent temperature and rainfall data and GCM simu-

substantially increase the stability of stratification in
permanently stratified Tanganyika and Malawi. Their
deep waters are continuously warm, but the <1°C dif-
ference between surface and deep water in warm sea-
sons maintains a density difference that prevents full
circulation. Lake Tanganyika’s deep water has been
characterized as a “relict” hypolimnion that formed
under a cooler climate within the past 1,000 years
(Hecky et al., 1994). Since then, warming has created
a barrier to vertical circulation. Additional warming
could strengthen this barrier and reduce the mixing of
deep, nutrient-rich hypolimnetic water and nutrient-
depleted surface layers; that mixing sustains one of
the most productive freshwater fisheries in the world
(Hecky et al., 1981).

"The seasonal runoff pattern for the Zambezi remained relative-
ly unchanged; the river was sensitive, however, to temporal
shifts of the rainy season. There was a net deficit in river flows
due to higher surface temperatures, which increase the rate of
evapotranspiration. Hydropower production at Kariba
decreased slightly under the GISS and GFDL scenarios, while
the cooler scenarios of UKMO and GISS led to small increas-
es in power generation. Seasonality of flow had more marked
effects on production, a function of storage capacity of the
dams in relation to ability to store excess and regulate water
flows. Under climate change, there would be less water enter-
ing Kariba, and this would likely lead to reduction in fish pop-
ulations. Adaptation to climate change for the Zambezi basin
was suggested to depend on better planning of water projects
that consider hydrological inter-relationships of the basin as a
whole, crossing many national boundaries. This requirement
for countries to look beyond their own needs is a major factor
in implementing adaptation options.

Botswana’s construction and textile industries had to retrench

Zimbabwe’s industrial sector; companies were almost forced to
pull out and relocate elsewhere because of a lack of water, and
half of the small businesses crumbled. In South Africa,

Availability of water varies considerably within countries, too,

suffering from water stress or scarcity in 1990; this situation is
getting worse as a consequence of rapid population growth,
expanding urbanization, and increased economic development.

faces difficulties in meeting subsistence requirements or devel-
oping specialized export crops. Household expenditures on
food are high—more than half of the annual budget, on average.
Africa receives the largest amount of food aid of any continent.
Low rates of female literacy and high rates of infant mortality
are indicative of populations that have low status and inade-
quate infrastructure for education and health—two essential
requirements for vigorous rural development. The high num-
bers of refugees highlight potential economic and political
instability. Vulnerable populations include smallholder agricul-
turists with inadequate resources, pastoralists, rural landless
laborers, and the urban poor. Rural populations are directly
affected by climatic variations. Reduced food supplies and high
prices immediately affect landless laborers who have little sav-
ings. The effect on agriculturists and pastoralists depends on
how much surplus they produce and the relative terms of trade
(e.g., between food and livestock). A dramatic increase in urban
poverty has been noted in the past decade—one consequence of
stagnant rural development and high population pressures. The
urban poor are indirectly affected by climate change through

"The effects of climatic variations on African agriculture have
been well established through decades of field experiments,
statistical analyses of observed yields, and monitoring of agri-
cultural production. The most important climatic element is
precipitation, particularly seasonal drought and the length of
the growing season. The distribution of rainfall within the
growing season also may affect yields. Local flooding and
storms are minor problems. Low temperatures and radiation
limit production in some high-elevation regions; frost is a haz-
ard in South Africa. High temperatures can affect yields and
yield quality in semi-arid and arid regions, although water is
more important. Sea-level rise and coastal erosion will affect
groundwater, irrigated agriculture, and low-lying coastal land
in some areas.

"Unfortunately, regional projections of precipitation change
diverge quite strongly in Africa. For example, scenarios of sum-
mer precipitation in the Sahel show a range of +20% for nine
atmosphere-ocean GCMs reported in Annex B. However, pre-
sent trends in precipitation in Africa show a decrease in some
regions. Recent transient scenarios report lower temperature
changes, globally as well as for Africa. Thus, for agriculture,
there is little confidence in present scenarios for precipitation—
the most important aspect of climate change for African agri-
culture. However, a combination of the potential effects of
increased CO, concentrations and lower temperatures (at time
of doubling) using transient scenarios suggests that the impacts
of these scenarios may be less severe than those of earlier equi-
librium GCM model experiments. Nevertheless, even a small
decrease in precipitation can be significant. Furthermore, few
scenarios of drought risk and the distribution of rainfall within
the growing season have been developed.

"At the national level, Figure 2-13 shows the variability in
national maize yields for selected countries (Hulme, 1996a).
The effects of the 1984-85 and 1991-92 droughts are clear (see
Box 2-6). The coefficient of variation for annual maize yields
varies from about 10% in central Africa to almost 50% in drier
countries such as Botswana and Swaziland. A significant com-
ponent of the variability is likely to be related to rainfall,
although prices and market policies are influential. The role of
precipitation in agricultural productivity was demonstrated
dramatically in the Sahel and eastern and southern Africa dur-
ing the drought period 1970-95 (Buckland, 1992). Water
scarcity revealed widespread dependence on rain-fed agricul-
ture and the lack of infrastructural development for supple-
mental irrigation and water resources. For example, Zimbabwe
in 1991 and 1992 imported 800,000 tons of maize, 250,000

1981-1984, 1986-1987, 1991-1992, and 1994-1995 (WMO, 1995; Usher, 1997). The causes of African drought are
numerous and vary among regions, seasons, and years. Local droughts occur every year; continental crises appear to
occur once (or more recently twice) every decade. Major droughts tend to be connected to ENSO anomalies. It seems
prudent to expect drought in Africa to continue to be a major climatic hazard.

"The effects of drought are cross-cutting, with severe direct impacts on agriculture, water resources, and natural vegetation
and indirect effects on health, the economy, and institutions (see Benson and Clay, 1994, for an overview of drought
impacts). The impacts of drought are confounded by environmental degradation, including soil erosion, water pollution, and
deforestation. Intersectoral linkages, the diversity of the economy, the numbers of vulnerable people, the intensity of water
use in the economy, the role of financial systems and public enterprises, and public revenue and expenditure affect the
severity and distribution of drought impacts. Drought in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s triggered widespread starvation and
loss of life, particularly in the Sahel and the Horn of Africa. Similar famine has been averted in the 1990s through more
effective early warning systems and responses. The aggregate impact of drought on the economies of Africa can be large:
8-9% of GDP in Zimbabwe and Zambia in 1992, 46% of GDP in Nigeria and Niger in 1984 (Benson and Clay, 1994).

"The potential effect of climate change on drought in Africa is uncertain. At a local level, increased temperatures are likely
to lead to increased moisture demand. The balance between rainfall and higher evapotranspiration implies more frequent
water scarcity. However, a great deal depends on vegetation response to higher CO, concentrations and the timing of rain-
fall. The combination of higher evapotranspiration and even a small decrease in precipitation could lead to significantly
greater drought risks. An increase in precipitation variability would compound temperature effects. For example, Hulme
(1996b) reports that interannual variability increases on the order of 25% in much of southern Africa in the UKTR sce-
nario for the 2050s. Within the region, however, some areas experience a similar decrease in variability. The temperature-
precipitation-CO, forcing of seasonal drought probably is less significant than the prospect of large-scale circulation
changes that drive continental droughts that occur over several years. A change in the frequency and duration of atmos-
phere-ocean anomalies, such as the ENSO phenomenon, could force such large-scale changes in Africa’s rainfall climatol-
ogy. However, such scenarios of climate change are not well developed at the global level, much less for Africa.

"The 1991-1992 episode in southern Africa amply illustrates the impact of drought. In that episode, the SADC countries
experienced the worst drought of the century: From central Zambia through central Malawi and Mozambique southward,
there were seasonal deficits of as much as 80% of normal rainfall (Zinyowera and Unganai, 1993). Large sections of the
SADC subregion received scanty rainfall—20-75% of normal—during the rainy season from October 1991 through
April 1992. Abnormally high temperatures (47°C along the South Africa-Zimbabwe border) exacerbated the extreme
dryness. Regional grain production fell 60% short of expected levels. Food stocks had been depleted, largely as a conse-
quence of exports. Roughly five times more food had to be brought into southern Africa than had been delivered to the
Horn of Africa during the famine of 1984-1985. Six different transport corridors were used to deliver food aid, and 11
countries assisted in trying to alleviate the crisis wrought by the drought. Even though 1992-1993 and 1993-1994 could
be considered post-drought periods, recovery in the subregion was slow. Nutritional status was affected by crop failure,
depending on alternative sources of income and drought responses. The number of food-insecure households among.
communal farmers in Zimbabwe more than doubled during the 1991-1992 drought, especially in semi-arid zones
(Christensen and Stack, 1992). The level of the reservoir at Kariba Dam, which supplies power to Zambia and
Zimbabwe, fell below the level required to generate hydroelectric power (see IUCN, 1994). Water shortages, electricity
shortages and rationing, input supply difficulties, reduction in demand, and macroeconomic constraints led to a 9%
reduction in manufacturing output in Zimbabwe, with a 6% loss in foreign currency receipts (Benson and Clay, 1994).

supply) through increased transpiration to maintain foliage
temperatures at their optimal range. Because a large portion
of African agriculture is rain-fed, however, heat-related plant
stress may reduce yields in several key crops—such as wheat,

fruit trees) require chilling periods (vernalization). Warmer
night temperatures could impede vernalization in plants that

"The general conclusion is that climate change will affect some
parts of Africa negatively, although it will enhance prospects
for crop production in other areas (see Downing, 1992, for case
studies of agriculture in Kenya, Zimbabwe, and Senegal).
Warmer climates will alter the distribution of agroecological
zones. Highlands may become more suitable for annual crop-
ping as a result of increased temperatures (and radiation) and
reduced frost hazards. Although C3 crops exhibit a positive
response to increased CO, (as much as 30% with 2xCO,), the
optimal productive temperature range is quite narrow. Some
regions could experience temperature stress at certain growing
periods—necessitating shifting of planting dates to minimize
this risk. Expansion of agriculture is important in the east
African highlands. For example, agroecological suitability in
the highlands of Kenya would increase by perhaps 20% with
warming of 2.5°C based on an index of potential food produc-
tion (Downing, 1992). In contrast, semi-arid areas are likely to
be worse off. In eastern Kenya, 2.5°C of warming results in a
20% decrease in calorie production. In some lowlands, high-
temperature events may affect some crops. Growth is hindered
by high temperatures, and plant metabolism for many cereal
crops begins to break down above 40°C. Burke et al. (1988)

demand for its products. In turn, rural health, incomes, and
development depend on viable agricultural economies, One
example of the potential interactions is the role of drought. A
small change in drought risk need not affect agriculture to a
great extent, as long as food supplies and household income
can be saved over several years. However, an increase in

diverse geography of South Africa into 712 relatively homoge-
neous zones, each associated with vegetation, soil, and climate
data. Daily values of temperature (minimum and maximum),
rainfall, wind speed, and solar radiation are used in the crop
evaluation, based on the CERES-Maize model. Recent scenario
analysis of the model (see Hulme, 1996a) shows a wide range
of potential maize yields in South Africa. For three scenarios of
climate change (corresponding to the middle of the next centu-
ty), yields decrease in the semi-arid west. For most of the coun-
try, however, potential yields would increase—generally by as
much as 5 t/ha. The CO, enrichment effect counteracts the rel-
atively modest changes in temperature and precipitation. In
parts of the eastern highlands, particularly in Lesotho, dramatic
increases in yields result from higher temperatures.

"Local coping strategies for drought and famine are well illustrated in the inner Niger delta of the Malian Sahel (Davies,
1996). Famine, although not entirely absent, is not a common occurrence in the Sahel. Periods of drought have been
more frequent since the late 1960s, although there is little consensus regarding their origin or whether such drought is a
permanent trend. Over the past 30 years or so, drought and famine have been part of a downward spiral of impoverish-
ment, increasing vulnerability, destitution, and sometimes death. As a result of the Sahelian droughts of the early 1970s
and the mid-1980s, fundamental changes are taking place in the livelihoods of people as they adapt to confront declining
food security. Local livelihood systems have become less resilient and more sensitive (more vulnerable) to food stress
with successive periods of drought. The nature and degree of vulnerability vary according to the livelihood system.
Famines could be mitigated if policymakers can recognize and reinforce local coping strategies.

"Early warnings do not guarantee effective responses. Early warnings by the drought monitoring centers and national
meteorological services of a severe drought in 1991 were largely ignored by government and donor agencies (SADC,
1994). Economic structural adjustment programs failed to take rainfall variability into account in their design and
emphasis on reform. Thus, numerous countries were poorly prepared, without a national disaster management program
in place. There were conflicts over statistics used in emergency programs—where data from different sources were not
reconciled—which led to delays in response. The response to the 1990s drought in Kenya was more positive; one month
after the drought was apparent, large-scale food imports were made, and local food stocks were utilized (Longhurst,
1992; see Downing ef al., 1990, for a description of the similar success in 1984-1985). Preprogrammed drought respons-
es also assisted in averting a major crisis: In northern Kenya, a decentralized early-warning system was well developed,
and recommendations were translated rapidly into firm decisions to mitigate the impact of the drought.

"The loss of human life and economic disruption associated with extreme climatic fluctuation can be lessened by enhanc-
ing household coping strategies, preparedness, and advanced warning and timely responses. The initial aim in responding
to drought is to maintain household livelihoods and mitigate the effects of rainfall shortages. Seasonal hunger, poverty,
and household crises recur among vulnerable households throughout Africa. It is often difficult for governments, donors,
and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to distinguish between chronic conditions and an emerging crisis during a
drought (or other shock). Recent scientific advances in understanding the climate system and predicting seasonal drought
provide an opportunity to reduce the vulnerability of human societies (Rasmusson, 1987; Hastenrath, 1995; Bonkoungou,
1996). Predictions of seasonal rainfall already are operational in many regions of Africa, with lead times of up to several
months. Longer-term forecasts also may be possible. However, drought predictions still need to be incorporated into
African management of agriculture, water, energy, and national economies (see Gibberd et al., 1996).

"Increasing drought preparedness in Africa has resulted in a plethora of organizations that monitor climate, agriculture, veg,
etation, and resources; make available early-warning information, participate in multidisciplinary research; and promote
preparedness plans. International early-warning systems such as the World Food Programme, the Food and Agriculture
Organization, Save the Children Fund, U.S. Famine Early Warning System, and Agence Européene pour le
Développement et la Santé, among others, link local and national efforts with international responses. Following the dev-
astating droughts of the 1970s in the Sahel, the AGRHYMET center was established in Niger. The SADC has a similar
program on food security. Drought monitoring centers in Kenya and Zimbabwe and the African Centre for Meteorological
Applications in Development were established in the 1990s. National departments, universities, and NGOs also have been
active in promoting drought monitoring, mitigation, and preparedness. By monitoring key indicators of staple food pro-
duction, national stocks, and import availability, a rough and ready national balance can be calculated using population
estimates and per capita needs (SADC, 1996). Most famine early-warning systems (EWSs) predict the failure of food sys-
tems (Wilhite and Easterling, 1987). Increasingly, the focus of monitoring and intervention has been on food-insecure peo-
ple who strive to subsist within food systems, rather than national food balances per se (Davies, 1996). Many EWSs now
monitor upstream determinants of production (such as rainfall and soil moisture) as well as downstream outcome indica-
tors (such as market prices for food and the nutritional status of those most vulnerable). Vulnerability assessment (and
mapping) is one tool for integrating the climatic, production, and socioeconomic dimensions of drought in the context of
sustainable development. Unfortunately, the focus often remains on food balances and food crises rather than solving
chronic hunger and enhancing the livelihoods of the most vulnerable populations.

motivations, constraints, and domains of authority of decision-
makers involved in shaping policy, implementing decisions,
and coping with the consequences of changes in resources and

principal stakeholders in African agriculture range from vul-

international organizations charged with planning, research,
and relief (see Gibberd et al., 1996, for examples in the context
of seasonal climate prediction). Consumers are the ultimate

Average potential yields, as simulated with 40 years of
climate data, range from more than 3.5 t/ha in Region II
(Karoi) to barely 1 t/ha in Region V (Beit Bridge).
There is a considerable gap between these potential
yields and the yields realized by farmers in the region.
In semi-arid zones (Region V), 500 kg/ha would be an
above-average yield. Average commercial farm yields
in the high veld are closer to the potential yield because
of application of fertilizer. For the two equilibrium sce-
narios of climate change, yields decrease in the high
veld (Karoi) and semi-arid region (Beit Bridge) but
increase in the middle zones (Gweru and Masvingo). If
the season start is adjusted, the yield decreases in the
high veld, and semi-arid zones produce sizable increas-
es. For example, planting on 15 October at Karoi results
in 3.7 t/ha at present. With climate change and delaying
planting to 1 November, yields would be 4.6 t/ha—a
25% increase. At Beit Bridge, the season would shift
toward earlier planting to avoid high temperatures and
water stress at the height of the summer.

Failure to cope with adverse change could lead to significant
deprivation, social disruption, and population displacement.
Producers adapt to climatic variations every season but have
varying interests in climate change. Subsistence farmers are
unlikely to have the resources necessary to consider specific
Strategies to adapt to climate change. Commercial farmers are
more likely to be linked to national markets and international
agribusinesses and able to invest in agricultural technology.
However, adopting specific strategies depends on cost effec-
tiveness within the context of short-term enterprise goals. One
of the key stakeholders in enacting forward-looking strategies
is business—from local market traders to international com-
modity and research organizations. However, commodity
traders are not likely to be affected directly by the conse-
quences of climate change, as long as production is viable and
trade required somewhere in the world. Incentives may be
required to induce agribusiness to adopt a longer planning
horizon and to develop and implement adaptive responses. At
present, the bulk of responsibility for designing, evaluating,
and implementing strategic responses falls upon national gov-
ernments, national and international research centers, and aid
organizations (particularly bilateral and multilateral groups,
although some international and even local NGOs may take an
interest in adaptation policies). These are the same actors

research and education are warranted to develop new solutions
and stimulate behavioral changes to accommodate climate

require improved research. Education on environmental issues
is warranted, although it is probably too soon to undertake spe-

"Regulation of resource allocation and development is deficient
in much of Africa. Institutional and regulatory reform may be
warranted to preclude development in areas that become increas-

ble communities (e.g., economic restructuring), Establishing pri-
orities for development based on future land capabilities may be
ptemature for most regions, but flexibility in development prior-
ities should be retained and new information taken into account.
For example, the ability of community groups to manage rapid
resource changes may warrant further support. Market structures
often support crops with a high level of risk and fail to support
markets for drought-tolerant crops. Regulations that constrain
free trade may increase the volatility of local markets and food
supplies in response to climatic variations.

"Beyond improving agriculture using available strategies, what
more should be done to plan for climate change? Ringius et al.
(1996) provided guidelines on adaptation for agriculture and
water in Africa (see also Downing et al., 1996). Anticipating
climate change may be warranted for projects with long life
spans (e.g., irrigation schemes); where the marginal cost of
adaptation is small or brings benefits regardless of climate
change; for protection against extreme events; and to prevent
irreversible impacts (e.g., preservation of biodiversity). For
example, the most certain aspect of climate change is increased
CO, concentrations. Efforts to enhance positive CO responses
in new cultivars may be worth the investment in plant breeding
and agricultural technology, irrespective of projected changes
in moisture availability. Strategic food reserves to buffer poten-
tial increases in the variation of local and national production
might be relatively inexpensive at the international level but
not warranted for most countries or at local grain banks.
Drought early warning and preparedness could build upon the
considerable improvements that already are underway in many
regions of Africa, including making better use of seasonal cli-

"These four broad strategies would promote African resilience
in the face of present climatic risks and enhance Africa’s
capacity to adapt to climate change. In the next few decades,
Africa must manage the transition from vulnerable subsistence

mate change over the next few decades. Climate change on top
of continued vulnerability and agricultural crises threatens
Tegional security.

"Maintaining international prices within accept-
able limits would benefit poorer countries that
might not be able to afford large imports in times
of scarcity. In the transition toward a new cli-
mate, such an international capacity to prevent
food deficits from becoming survival emergen-
cies would appeal to the humanitarian goals of
ending famine and reducing hunger.

* Encouraging free trade between and among
countries should stimulate agricultural markets in
regions with a comparative advantage. This trade
may be a major benefit to some countries and a
significant cost to others, as the impacts of cli-
mate change alter traditional markets. In princi-
ple, free trade allows national surpluses and
deficits to be accommodated more efficiently.
Thus, supply and price fluctuations are buffered
at the global level, widening the potential pool of
responses to climate change.

* International mechanisms to promote agrotech-
nology transfers to developing countries might
focus on basic foodstuffs: wheat, rice, and maize.
International agencies might license new tech-
nologies developed by biotechnology firms for
dissemination and use in developing countries.

Reducing drought risk and societal vulnerability
would provide greater resilience in coping with cli-
mate change. Concerted action is required in three
areas: mitigation to reduce vulnerability, monitoring
drought and vulnerability, and preparedness to respond
effectively to emerging crises. Considerable progress
has been made in the past decade; a further decade of
development might reap substantial rewards in efforts
to eliminate widespread famine and enhance liveli-
hood security, at least in times of drought (see
Downing et al., 1996; Gibberd et al., 1996). The pri-
ority stakeholders should be the most vulnerable
socioeconomic groups affected by drought crises—
although many levels of local, national, and interna-
tional actors are required to implement drought moni-
toring, mitigation, and emergency responses.

Farm-level adaptive responses include substitution of
agronomic practices (changes in sowing date, planting
density, cultivars, etc.); altered inputs (¢.g., fertilizer, pest
and weed control, crop choice); and agricultural devel-
opment (soil and water management that requires more
substantial investment). The priority stakeholder is the
smallholder farming sector. Commercial farms would be
less likely to need assistance in these sorts of adaptive
strategies, On the other hand, these strategies are less
likely to be effective for agropastoralists and pastoralism
in general. Such farm-level agronomic improvements
can be effective, can be readily implemented, and have
few substantial constraints to their adoption.

At the national level, three strategies commonly are

proposed:

* Maintaining strategic reserves allows the govern-
ment (or marketing bodies) to dampen price fluc-
tuations and release food in emerging crises.
Large national reserves have been held in the
past, but have been reduced under structural
adjustment agreements because of their cost.

* Markets and trading conditions could be adjusted
to promote private-sector responses to climate
change and climatic variability. This strategy
might take the form of tax incentives for carry-
over stocks or bonds to smooth income between
adverse and good trading years. This approach
would build upon present efforts to reduce trade
barriers, with some specific adjustments to
accommodate climate change.

* Promoting agricultural development in general
would close the gap between research and prac-
tice. The need to adapt to climate change could be
used as one argument for fresh initiatives in pro-
moting adaptive agricultural research and devel-
opment in Africa.

The primary beneficiaries of such national adaptive

strategies are consumers and commercial producers

who depend on markets for food consumption.

"The vulnerability of fisheries to climate change depends on the
nature of the climate change, the nature of the fishery, and its
species and habitats. Changes in climatic conditions such as air
temperature and precipitation affect fisheries by altering habi-
tat availability or quality. Specifically, fisheries habitats may
be affected by changes in water temperature; the timing and
duration of extreme temperature conditions; the magnitude and
pattern of annual stream flows; surface-water elevations; and
the shorelines of lakes, reservoirs, and near-shore marine envi-
ronments (Carpenter et al., 1992).

"Mean annual air temperature is the most important factor in
predicting lake fish production across latitudes. Alterations in
seasonal climate patterns should change the population distri-
butions in larger lakes. Large-lake fish production could
increase about 6% with a 1°C rise in average annual air tem-
perature (Meisner et al., 1987; IPCC 1996, WG II, Section
16.2.1). Warm-water lakes generally have higher productivi-
ty than cold-water lakes, and existing warm-water lakes will
be in areas with the least change in temperature. It is reason-
able to expect higher overall productivity from freshwater
systems.

"Fish make up a significant part of the food supply in Africa
(Hersoug, 1995). FAO (1993) estimates the total fish harvest
potential at around 10.5 million tons: 7.8 million in saltwater
fisheries and 2.7 million in freshwater fisheries. In a densely
populated country such as Nigeria, as much as one-third of the
protein supply comes from fish (Hersoug, 1995). Consequently,
any fluctuation in the fish stock will impact planning and man-
agement. A reduction in fish stocks will have the greatest effect
on countries that are heavily dependent on fisheries and cannot
diversify easily into other activities; Mauritania, Namibia, and
Somalia are examples of African countries in this category
(Clarke, 1993).

the Nile, the Congo, and the Zambezi River systems; they also
include several inland drainage areas associated with lakes
(Hlohowskyj et al., 1996). Among the riverine systems, the
Congo River (including its major tributaries) contains the most
diverse fish fauna, with about 690 species (of which 80% are
endemic) (Lowe-McConnell, 1987). Lacustrine systems in
Africa (particularly the Rift Valley lakes) contain the most
diverse and unique fish assemblages found anywhere in Africa,
if not the world. For example, Lake Malawi has more than 240
identified fish species (of which more than 90% are endemic),

A shift in centers of production and the composition of
fish species as ecosystems move geographically and
change internally. This is in contrast to freshwater fish
species—particularly in small, shallow rivers and
lakes—which will have limited possibilities to adapt to
the changes through migration.

Economic values can be expected to fall until long-
term stability is reestablished. Rapid changes result-
ing from physical forcing favor smaller, low-priced,
opportunistic species that discharge large numbers of
eggs over long periods.

Where ecosystems shift position, national fisheries will
suffer if institutional mechanisms are not in place that
enable fishermen to move within and across present
exclusive economic zone boundaries. Subsistence and

musical instruments, railway sleepers, and carvings. In such
cases, natural stands are harvested by removing large and
viable trees, with residual stands left to recover. It is likely that
natural stands would take 60 or more years before they produce
trees of harvestable size. Exotic species, on the other hand, can
take less than 10 years to about 30 years to produce poles and

increase flooding caused by storm surges and intense rain-
storms. The coastal nations of west and central Africa (e.g.,
Senegal, The Gambia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Cameroon,
Gabon, Angola) have low-lying lagoonal coasts that are sus-
ceptible to erosion and hence are threatened by sea-level rise,
particularly because most of the countries in this area have
major and rapidly expanding cities on the coast (IPCC, 1996).

"The coastal zone of east Africa also will be affected—although,
unlike west Africa’s Atlantic coast, this area experiences calm
conditions through much of the year. Along the east coast of
Africa, sea-level rise and climatic variation may decrease the
attenuation of coral and patch reefs that have evolved along
major sections of the continental shelf. The lessening of this
buffer effect as a result of climate change would increase the
potential for erosion of the east coast. Increases in population
growth rates in the principal coastal cities of east Africa, com-
bined with a likelihood of a 1-m sea-level rise, could create
conditions for significant negative impacts on tourism-oriented
economies, ecology, and natural habitats of this area.

Benin, Togo, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria, most of the economic

"Coastal population pressures and increasing exploitation of
coastal resources—utilizing conflicting exploitation methods—
have led to coastal degradation. Coastal erosion, flooding, pol-
lution (air, water, land), deforestation, saltwater intrusion, and
subsidence are some of the environmental problems degrading
large parts of the coastal area of Africa. Coastal erosion already
has been reported to reach 23-30 m annually in some parts of
coastal west Africa (Ibe and Quelennac, 1989). In Cote d’ Ivoire,
high erosion rates have been reported in areas off the Abidjan
harbor. It also is estimated that about 40% of the mangroves in
Nigeria had been lost by 1980 (WRI, 1990); about 60% of man-
grove areas in Senegal also have been lost as a result of man-
grove clearing, coastal erosion, and increases in the salinity of
water and soil. Industrial pollution from oil spills and discharge
of domestic untreated wastes is polluting large areas of the
coast, including lagoons and near-shore areas. The Korle lagoon
in Accra, Lagos lagoon, and Ebrie lagoon in Abidjan all have
been polluted, resulting in loss of fisheries resources.

severe impacts not only on the pattern of distribution of human

"The impacts of climate change on the energy sector will be felt
primarily through losses or changes in hydropower potential
for electricity generation and the effects of increased runoff
(and consequent siltation) on hydrogeneration, as well as
changes in the growth rates of trees used for fuelwood. The
total primary energy use in 1990 in sub-Saharan Africa (includ-
ing South Africa) was broken down in the following shares:
biomass fuels (53%), petroleum (26%), coal (14%), large-scale
hydro (3%), natural gas (2%), and other renewables (2%). The
most vulnerable areas of the energy sector to climate change in
Africa are the provision of energy services for rural areas and,
to some extent, for urban low-income needs. Table 2-9 shows
that millions of cubic meters of wood are harvested each year
for energy purposes. The extent of biomass dependence for the
African energy sector is high; this dependence is critical
because the source of biomass is supported only by the natural
regeneration of indigenous natural forests. In addition to the
primary energy sources listed in Table 2-10, dependence on
charcoal is high in east and southern Africa, in countries such
as Zambia and Tanzania; in Zambia, where charcoal provides
80% of urban household energy needs, 3.5 million tons of char-

"In 1992, Africa’s electricity output was 312,000 GWh; thermal
power provided 78% and hydroelectricity 19%, with a small
amount (3%) from nuclear sources in South Africa (ADB AEP,
1996). Thermal power plants require huge volumes of water in
their cooling systems; in a situation of reduced rainfall, loss of
cooling-water resources will not only reduce generation capac-
ity but also retard construction of new plants. It may be rea-
sonably expected, therefore, that exploitation of the continent’s
massive coal reserves in areas with such resources would be
inhibited by both the anti-coal lobby and shortages of cooling
water. In the past (e.g., during the drought of 1991-92),
declines in precipitation led to a significant loss of total
hydropower energy, including losses of as much as 30% from
the Kariba Dam (which supplies power for Zambia and
Zimbabwe). It has been suggested that future hydropwer out-
put could could be affected by climate change. Salewicz (1995)
investigated the vulnerability of the Zambezi basin to climate
change. He noted that 75% of the lower Zambezi waters flow
into Kariba. Under climate change scenarios, this area is pro-
jected to experience increased rainfall and runoff into Lake
Kariba. Although there may be shifts in the seasonal reliability
of given discharges for the Lower Zambezi, it is possible that
hydropower generation capacity would be adversely affected.
Similar impacts could occur on the Congo, Nile, and Niger
river hydropower systems, resulting in critical electricity sup-
ply shortfalls throughout the continent. In addition, the conti-
nent’s massive hydroelectric potential of 150,000 GWh/yr
would be significantly curtailed. Such a situation would lead to
the introduction of major changes in fuel supply strategies in
most countries. A case has been made for developing micro-
and small-scale hydropower plants in Africa to overcome the
cost of large-scale generation systems. This type of plant will
require a defined minimum level of runoff. Reductions in pre-
cipitation could significantly reduce the number of viable sites
for such micro-hydro installations.

"In the household sector, fuelwood accounts for 97% of all ener-
gy consumed (Chidumayo, 1997). Although natural stocks of
wood may be high, wood resources available to the majority of
the rural population are very low in many areas. Brickmaking
and tobacco and tea curing are major wood uses. In Zimbabwe,
wood used for brickmaking is said to equal that used for cook-
ing in rural areas (Bradley and Dewees, 1993); tobacco estates
in Malawi account for 21% of total fuelwood consumption
(Moyo et al., 1993). In Botswana, the fencing of fields to keep
out livestock consumes 1.5 times more wood than is used for
cooking in farming households (Tietema et al, 1991).
Indigenous miombo and other woodlands in sub-Saharan
Africa contribute significantly to the firewood harvested for
consumption and conversion to charcoal. Stands are left to
recover, with minimal active management. The ability of users
to purchase alternative forms of energy (gas or electricity), as
well as charcoal, depends on the economics of each family.
Therefore, poor people (with limited buying power) are most
vulnerable to reductions in fuelwood supply. Increasing popu-
lations also are contributing to depletion of resources. In rela-
tively dense woodland areas, where population density is low,
there usually is enough deadwood that can be collected and
used for fuelwood. Increasing incidence of drought, however,
leads to increased fire frequency—which, in turn, reduces
deadwood material in woodlands. If current natural resource
management systems are not changed, Africa could run the risk
of depleting its forest resources used as biomass energy at a
rate faster than the rate of population growth. The paucity of
data on biomass depletion and regeneration rates makes mean-
ingful assessment difficult and compounds the problems of
possible reduced precipitation and subsequent lower regenera-
tion rates by making it difficult to identify appropriate response
options. There already are indications of a negative supply bal-
ance (e.g., extensive household utilization of agricultural and
animal wastes for energy).

change leads to drier conditions, maintenance costs may be

gravel roads linking major urban centers, which have paved

"Impacts on air transport would be greatest for airports located
in coastal areas or near other water bodies, such as rivers or
lakes. Indirect effects also would be felt if increased precipita-
tion resulted from climate change, as some models have sug-

such as meteorological data bases—may be stretched to their
limits because they were designed for certain prevailing cli-

potential for air traffic accidents.

"New and renewable energy sources, however, offer other bene-
fits in addition to being alternatives to large hydropower and
thermal power generation systems. These alternative energy
sources will generate more jobs overall in the economy.
According to Kane (1996), these jobs will be high-quality jobs,
mainly in systems design. For this reason, this benefit may
remain limited in Africa because the continent lags other regions
in the development of new technologies such as windmills, solar
photovoltaics (PVs), and biogas digesters, which have been
spearheaded in China and India. African countries should take
immediate steps, with external support, to rectify this deficiency.

"The suggestion that a “solar revolution” (Kane, 1996) may
replace the temporary fossil economy is rather simplistic. For
African countries—which have yet to develop their infrastruc-
ture significantly and their basic industries—the need for cen-
tralized energy systems will continue for some time, although
it may coexist with advances in solar installations. Besides this
general transition, Africa’s centralized energy systems—
including hydroelectric, coal, and oil thermal systems—will
need to benefit from cleaner, more efficient energy-conversion
technologies. This transition will be based on autonomous effi-
ciency improvements in the short to medium term, but Africa
will not be in a position to drive trends toward such improve-
ments, due to economic and technical trends.

"Agricultural production activities involve extensive trans-
portation on the farm, to ferry farm products and inputs and to
move farm implements. These critical operations are easily
disturbed by excessive rains. The effects of such disturbances
are likely to be higher in the case of large-scale commercial
farms, which are highly mechanized. During recent droughts
on the continent, soils on roads became friable as a result of
high temperatures and dry weather. Such roads were easily
washed away when the rains finally came, resulting in serious
soil erosion and high repair costs to farmers. For small-scale
communal land farmers, this situation was represented by
massive soil erosion along pathways on and off the farm. In
many cases, these washed-out pathways became the source of
gullies.

Caprivi Strip wetlands resulted in a population reduction of the
wetland vertebrates and the complete disappearance of some

followed by encroachment of human cultivation.

"With regard to industry, it has been suggested that “much of
industry will have to mimic nature, reusing and recycling every
chemical that it uses in cyclical processes.” This approach
implies “shifting to sustainable industries” (Kane, 1996).
Before the current climate change debate, this strategy entailed
using renewable materials for industrial raw materials—such
as natural fibers as opposed to finite resources such as miner-
als. However, reduced productivity in agriculture—which is
the current base for industrial raw materials in most African
countries—limits the usefulness of this suggestion.

"Energy efficiency improvements—which, in Africa, will have
to be autonomous in most cases—offer a significant response
option. Energy wastage in Africa is quite high; in some cases,
savings of up to 40% can be achieved. In the electricity sector,
total system losses sometimes exceed 30% in situations where
universal standards are below 8%, including some systems in
Africa (Davidson, 1992). Reducing these inefficiencies will
provide a demand-side option for electricity supply. Demand-
side management options, however, need strong support pro-
grams to overcome a number of implementation barriers.

"High levels of floral and faunal species diversity exist in vari-
ous reserved areas in relict, fragmented patches of natural veg-
etation. Most wildlife is in reserved areas surrounded by human
land use (agriculture). This fragmentation and concentration of
animals in specific areas make them highly vulnerable because
vegetation (habitat) will not respond quickly enough to changed
climate, and wildlife will be unable to migrate to more suitable
climatic conditions because of limited corridors between
wildlife reserves in different vegetation and climate types;
moreover, wildlife would be slow in responding to a changing
habitat boundary (see Section 2.3.1.4).

"Climate change will impact the tourism industry indirectly
through changes in water and vegetation, as well as through
wider-scale socioeconomic changes—for example, fuel prices
and patterns of demand for specific activities or destinations.
Various indirect impacts also may derive from changes in land-
scape—the “capital” of tourism (Krippendorf, 1984)—which
might lead potential tourists to perceive Africa as less attractive
and consequently to seek new locations elsewhere. There also
may be new competition from other tourist locations as cli-
mates change (particularly on seasonal time frames), especial-
ly in relation to northern vacation periods.

"Tourist attractions such as Victoria Falls could become much
less attractive as a result of reduced river discharge and alter-
ation of the rainforest. Hydrology models for tropical savanna
Africa suggest reduced runoff as a result of climate change
(Hulme, 1996a). The tourist impacts of these changes will
include alteration of characteristics of popular tourist destina-
tions. In the 1992 drought period, Victoria Falls lost some of
its attractiveness as a result of much reduced water discharge
over the falls. Furthermore, the reduced flow resulted in
reduction of the spray that maintains the rainforest that is part
of Victoria Falls’ aura—resulting in the death of flora around
the falls.

"Small-scale mills have been suggested as ideal for developing
countries because they could achieve recycling of resources
and greater efficiencies (Kane, 1996). It would be more effi-
cient, for example, to install small-scale mills in dispersed
locations around the country to reduce the cost of moving scrap
to large, centrally located mills. In Africa, this approach would
be a relevant option to reduce the decline or depletion rate for
natural ores and to disperse job opportunities around the coun-
try. Steel production is significant in Nigeria, Zimbabwe, and
South Africa; plants in these countries, however, are tradition-
al large-scale installations. The introduction of small-scale
mills could enable the industry to spread to other locations
across the continent.

"In southern and eastern Africa, there are a variety of water-
based tourist activities—such as sailing, skiing, angling, raft-
ing, and so forth. Such activities could be affected by changes
in river flows and the impacts of land use (especially agricul-
ture) on water quality—such as eutrophication, which gives
rise to objectionable blue-green algae and a proliferation of
aquatic weeds (such as Eichhornia and Salvinia). These devel-
opments will compromise the aesthetic value of tourist desti-
nations. Many reservoirs in Africa (such as Lake Victoria and
the Nile Sudd) are under threat. In addition to their tourist
value, these inland waters in Africa are a source of protein.
Many water bodies in Africa show very high sensitivity to
changes in runoff. Inland drainage systems—such as Lake
Chad, the east African Rift Valley lakes (e.g., Lake Nakuru,
Lake Naivasha), and other shallow water bodies such as Lake
Chilwa and the Okovango delta—have a delicate hydrological
balance. Complete drying of the lake recently occurred at Lake
Chilwa in Malawi and Lake Nakuru in Kenya. Magadza (1984,

such as Lake Kariba can be significantly affected by decreased

dry-dock facilities have lain idle for several years. Figure 2-14

more pronounced on reservoirs that combine other activities

"Cape Cross, one of the earliest recorded (15th century) points of contact for European explorers in southern Africa, is
best known for the large Cape Fur Seal (Arctocephalus pusillus) colony, numbering about 150,000 animals. To the south
of the rocky promontory, a sand barrier has formed from sediments continually washed north from the Orange River.
Behind this barrier is a series of lagoons, 5 km? in extent, comprising salt flats fed by seawater seepage and high-tide
washovers (Williams, 1990), Wooden guano platforms were erected in these areas in the 1950s to allow cormorants to
breed and roost (Rand, 1952). Guano is still harvested today from 30,000 pairs of Cape cormorants that nest there

tourism activities as an important win-win solution to the
nature resource that also offers a major source of much-needed
revenue (World Bank, 1996). In a report on wildlife conser-

that wildlife presented the best land-use options in semi-arid
parts of southeast Zimbabwe. This application, in the
Gonarezhou nature reserve, has been facilitated by an appro-

"Projected increases in the interannual variability of climate
would have marked implications for the impact of seasonal
epidemic diseases such as malaria. In general, control and mit-

expected levels in any one year. Significant interannual varia-
tion impedes intervention and mitigation because of the impact
on national budgets (which plan for mean circumstances) and
lags that occur in relation to responses to climatically induced
epidemic situations. In addition, such variation results in inter-
mittent exposure of nonimmune populations—tesulting in high
levels of morbidity and mortality. The recent degree of vari-
ability is clearly illustrated in Table 2-13, which shows data for
four southern African countries. This variability highlights the
need for more climate-based forecasting systems capable of
predicting such interannual variations with a lead time that

preparatory/preventative measures (Jury, 1996; le Sueur and

"season permissive to transmission. T,,,, is known to play an
important role in limiting the distribution of malaria vector
populations at a given locality where summer conditions are
suitable for transmission (Craig and le Sueur, in preparation;
Leeson, 1931). Thus, meteorological variables can create con-
ditions conducive to disease spread or even to clusters of out-
breaks (in the case of flooding or drought) (Epstein er al.,
1993). A drop in water level in dams and rivers also would
affect the quality of household and industrial fresh water
because reduced water volume would increase the concentra-
tion of sewage and other effluent in rivers—resulting in out-
breaks of diseases such as diarrhea, dysentery, and cholera.
During 1992 and 1993, cholera affected almost every country
in the SADC region, claiming hundreds of lives. In many
drought-affected areas in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, and
South Africa, streams and rivers dried up. Villagers (mainly
women) had to walk long distances—only to collect polluted
water, which they shared with wild animals and livestock.
SARDC (1994) notes that when a major cholera outbreak
occurred in several countries in southern Africa in the mid-
1980s, the region had just come out of another drought.
Reduced water flow during these droughts reduced the capaci-
ty of rivers, streams, and swamps to dilute agrochemicals and
process fertilizers in fields, adversely affecting soil ecosys-
tems. These drought-related problems are likely to increase
under projected climate change. Vulnerabilities and control
measures will affect the impact, however.

increase the range of the vector in areas prone to this infection.
The distribution of tsetse flies may increase in east Africa
(Rogers and Packer, 1993). Other minor health effects could
include higher incidences of skin disorders or cancers, cataracts
and similar forms of eye damage, and suppression of immune

"Climate-related impacts on health status are likely to increase
most within Africa, largely as a result of the high burden of dis-
ease within the continent and its vulnerability in terms of miti-
gation and nutritional status. In contrast to other regions of the
world, a significant proportion of the burden of disease in Africa
is related to climatically affected infectious diseases. Typical of
many of these diseases in Africa is the fact that their severity
focuses within the tropics, and infection rates approach satura-
tion. Thus, the marginal regions of distributions, where severity
of transmission is restricted climatologically, are most likely to
be affected by climatic change. It is important to distinguish
between restrictions related to rainfall and those related to tem-
perature. In cases where rainfall restricts distribution, increases
in temperature may result in a decrease in disease incidence and
distribution. Conversely, in areas where low temperature cur-
rently limits distribution, increased temperature may increase
regional severity and cause distributional extension.

often disrupt natural habitats through processes such as defor-
estation or afforestation, resulting in the provision of new habi-
tats for vectors or pathogens. Climatically induced change,
however, can include short-term impacts as a result of interan-
nual variation or long-term change associated with factors such
as global warming. The effects of such changes are likely to be
most noticeable in areas that constitute the fringes of distribu-
tion of a particular disease. Changes in distribution often will
cause susceptible populations (those with little or no immuni-
ty) to be exposed to diseases not previously encountered—and
result in severe morbidity and mortality. In addition, areas of
traditionally low risk may become more vulnerable. The impli-
cations of such changes, especially in populations that lack
immunity, have severe consequences (individual, social, and
economic) for exposed individuals and health authorities.

"Malaria is a vector-borne environmental disease; as such, it is greatly influenced by macro- and microenvironmental
changes. The impact of human-induced environmental change on malaria can be graded on a scale that commences at a
global level and terminates at the level of an individual family homestead. In the investigation of environmentally induced
changes in malaria transmission, it is impossible to restrict the study to localized environmental changes because they are
nested within the changing macroenvironment. To understand the dynamics of these changes, as well as their interactions
and their potential for prediction of occurrence, it is essential that we consider the role of macroenvironmental change
(e.g., global warming) as well as microenvironmental change (e.g., deforestation or changes in land-use pattems, housing
type, migration).

"The use of integrated assessment models has not been wide-

"will require fundamental advances in the research literature. As
a basis for integration, primary research on impacts on the

"	Text
"Studies in Rwanda (Loevinsohn, 1994) and Kenya (Knight and Neville, 1991; Some, 1994) have investigated the extent
to which small-scale land-use changes can be responsible for dramatic increases in highland malaria. The effects of
short-term environmental changes, as well as changes in human behavioral patterns (e.g., migration, changes in control
activities in adjacent regions), are superimposed on more general effects of macroenvironmental change and are likely to
play an important role in the onset of epidemics. Thus, although climate change may mean certain regions become more
susceptible to malaria transmission, the actual risk of epidemics may remain low because of the absence of local contrib-
utory risk factors.
"	Text
"The premise that climate variables, on their own, may not always reliably predict epidemic risk has important implica-
tions for the forecasting of epidemics and changes in distribution. This model is not definitive but provides an illustration
of how climate may impact upon disease distribution and how regions of impact may be delineated. Similarly, the
change or shift in severity in existing malarial regions could be modeled. The figures illustrate that increased tempera-
tures would significantly increase susceptible regions in areas of the Southern Hemisphere where distribution previously
was constrained by latitude. In contrast, northern Africa is not affected because the distribution concurs with the Sahelian
region, where the absence of rainfall and high temperatures limits the disease (similarly with Botswana). Conversely, in
certain areas of southern Africa, especially South Africa, low temperatures previously were limiting—thus, a significant
increase in distribution is likely.
"	Text
"There is little doubt that global warming is now a reality (IPCC 1990, Chapters 5, 7, 8). Over the past three decades
there has been a marked increase in mean temperatures, especially at higher latitudes; in the tropics, the increase is esti-
mated to be about 0.2°C (IPCC 1990, Chapter 5). Some attention has focused on global climate change and its implica-
tions for epidemic malaria transmission (Bouma et al., 1994; Martens et al., 1995a; Martin and Lefebvre, 1995). The
impact of these climatic changes on malaria is likely to be greatest in regions where malaria transmission previously was
limited physiologically by low temperatures, which limit the development of the vector and the parasite. In these areas,
transmission is likely to be limited to specific seasons (when temperatures are favorable) or may not occur at all.
Increased temperatures will lengthen the transmission season, resulting in a marked increase in incidence. Increased tem-
peratures also can expand transmission into regions that previously defined the limits of malaria transmission because of
the effects of latitude or elevation (or both).
"	Text
"The accompanying figures a, b, c, and d provide a delineation of regions that would be environmentally affected by 0.5°C
and 1.0°C increases in temperature. Figures a and b limit the modeling process to the highland areas of Africa, whereas
Figures c and d include regions in which malaria distribution previously was restricted by elevation and latitude. These
“new” zones of malaria transmission would be intermediate between areas of known annual transmission and those where
malaria has never occurred. With respect to the latter (the upper limit), the simulation errs on the side of caution: Malaria
always is limited (cannot occur at present) and is not subject to interannual variation. It uses existing long-term, retrospec-
tive, climatological (temperature and rainfall) and topographic surfaces that already exist for Africa (Hutchinson et al.,
1995). Inherent in the prerequisite for such epidemic fringe malaria (elevation or latitude) is that in certain years a window
of suitable environmental conditions will exist. This window consists of a number of consecutive months with suitable
environmental conditions. The graphic provides a conservative estimate; it assumes a prerequisite of five consecutive
months, whereas in some regions (such as the Sahel) this may be as short as three (Bagayako, pers. comm.). Despite the
occurrence of such a window, transmission may not occur. Transmission then will be contingent on human activities that
result in the introduction of the parasite into this suitable (short-term) climatological environment.

change and its impacts. Over the period of this assessment,
climate change is expected to contribute to major physical,
ecological, sociological, and economic changes already
begun in the Arctic. Because of a variety of positive feed-
back mechanisms, the Arctic is likely to respond to climate
change rapidly and more severely than any other area on
earth. The most direct and pronounced changes to the
Arctic are likely to include changes in temperature and
precipitation, with subsequent effects on sea ice and per-
mafrost. Much smaller changes are likely for the Antarctic
over the period of this assessment. The Antarctic is likely
to respond relatively slowly to climate change.
Substantial loss of sea ice is expected in the Arctic Ocean.
If there is more open water, there will be impacts on the
climate system of northern countries as temperatures mod-
erate and precipitation increases. If warming occurs, there
will be considerable thawing of permafrost—leading to
changes in drainage, increased slumping, and altered land-
scapes over large areas.

Polar warming probably should increase biological pro-
duction but may lead to different species composition on
land and in the sea. On land, there will be a tendency for
poleward shifts in major biomes and associated animals.
However, the Arctic Ocean geographically limits move-
ment of the tundra, taiga, and boreal forest. In the sea,
marine ecosystems will move poleward. Animals depen-
dent on ice may be disadvantaged.

Changes in the polar climate are likely to affect the rest of
the world through increased sea levels from melting of the
cryosphere, increased warming of lower latitudes from
slowing of oceanic transport of heat, and increased green-
house gas levels through carbon dioxide and methane
emissions in the Arctic.

Human communities in the Arctic will be affected by these
physical and ecological changes. The effects will be par-
ticularly important for indigenous peoples leading tradi-
tional lifestyles.

There will be economic benefits and costs. Benefits
include new opportunities for shipping across the Arctic
Ocean, lower operational costs for the oil and gas industry,
lower heating costs, and easier access for tourism.
Increased costs can be expected from several sources,
including disruptions caused by thawing of permafrost and

reduced transportation capabilities across frozen ground

"Regional Climate. Cold is the overwhelming characteris-
tic of polar regions, with nine months of snow, ice, cold,
and relative darkness. In the Arctic, there are only a few
weeks of thaw, when much of the ground is boggy and
awash with water. There also are episodes of extreme cold
and storms. In Antarctica, temperatures mostly remain
below freezing.

Climate Trends. Parts of the Arctic and Antarctic have
warmed over the past half-century, while some parts
appear to have cooled. Precipitation seems higher. Trends
in the overall ice balance of the world’s major ice sheets in
Greenland and Antarctica are uncertain. There is conflict-
ing information on changes in the thickness and extent of
sea ice globally. Ice seems to be thinning in the Arctic but
not in the Antarctic.

Vulnerability and Impacts. Systems in the Arctic and
Antarctic Peninsula are extremely sensitive to tempera-
ture. The primary impacts will be on the physical environ-
ment, biota and ecosystems, and human activities. The
Arctic Ocean has strong sensitivity to temperature because
its exposed areal extent grows and shrinks by as much as
50% within a single year. Interannual variability in sea ice
similarly shows extreme sensitivity to temperature. The
Arctic terrestrial system, primarily based on permafrost,
also is very sensitive to temperature because much of the
permafrost is currently discontinuous. Strong positive
feedback mechanisms within the Arctic suggest that cli-
mate change is likely to be more severe in the Arctic than

Terrestrial Ecological Systems. Climate change may
occur at a rapid rate relative to forest migration ability. If
there is warming, there will be a poleward migration of the
northern treeline. However, geographic limitations may
restrict the migration of the boreal forest. If warming
occurs and the forest cover changes, there will be major
impacts on biological resources (e.g., bears, caribou, small
mammals, amphibians, and insects). The effects of climate
change have not been deeply investigated in the Antarctic
terrestrial ecosystem, but its distribution and specific com-
position could be altered by global warming.

Marine Ecological Systems. In general, productivity
should rise. Warming should increase growth and develop-
ment rates of nonmammals; however, ultraviolet-B (UV-B)
radiation is still increasing, which may constrain primary
productivity as well as fish productivity. Additional risks
include the loss of sea-ice cover, upon which several
marine mammals depend for food and protection. Also,

"Sub-Antarctic Islands. These small, isolated, usually
uninhabited islands in the Southern Ocean have special-
ized flora and important marine mammals and birds. Many
seem to have warmed over the past 50 years, and this trend
is expected to continue. Climate change impacts are
unlikely to be important for most animal and bird species,
but plant communities could change. Glaciers will proba-
bly shrink.

Arctic Settlements. If the climate ameliorates, conditions
will favor the northward spread of agriculture, forestry,
and mining, with an expansion of population and settle-
ments. More infrastructure—such as marine, road, rail,
and air links—would be required. Changes in the distribu-
tion and abundance of sea and land animals will impact on
traditional lifestyles of native communities.
Infrastructure. If the permafrost thaws, much infrastruc-
ture—including pipelines, airstrips, water supply and
sewage systems, building foundations, roads, rail lines,
and mining systems and structures—will be damaged.
Thawing could disrupt petroleum production in the tundra.
Redesign and replacement of many of these systems will
be needed.

Integrated Analysis. Direct effects could include ecosys-
tem shifts, sea- and river-ice loss, and permafrost thaw.
Indirect effects could include positive feedback to the cli-
mate system. There will be new challenges and opportuni-
ties for shipping, the oil industry, fishing, mining, tourism,
infrastructure, and the movement of populations, resulting
in more interactions and changes in trade and strategic bal-
ance. There will be winners and losers. As examples, a
reduced and thinning ice cover will disadvantage polar
bears, while sea otters will have new habitats; communi-
ties on new shipping routes will grow, while those built on
permafrost will have difficulties. Native communities will
face profound changes impacting on traditional lifestyles.
"	List
"Arctic shipping, oil exploration and transport, and econom-
ic development could bring risks to many species.
Additional Stressors. In addition to climatically driven
changes, such as changes in sea ice and temperature, the
Arctic currently is stressed from a variety of sources, and
some of these stresses are likely to increase in the next few
decades. Additional stresses that may confound the effects
of climate change include hydrocarbons, radionuclides,
acidification, heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants,
and UV radiation, as well as increased human develop-
ment, traffic, and potential oil spills.

Ice. If there is warming, the Arctic Ocean, as well as Arctic
lakes and streams, could experience a thinner and reduced
ice cover. In contrast, vast Antarctica is so cold that any
warming within the IPCC scenarios should have little
impact except in the Dry Valleys and on the Antarctic
Peninsula. In fact, ice could accumulate through greater
snowfall, slowing sea-level rise.

Permafrost. Permafrost covers all of Antarctica and most
of the Arctic. Much of the Arctic permafrost is close to
thawing, making it an area extremely sensitive to even
small changes in temperature. Effects of thawing per-
mafrost include large-scale slumping, erosion, and sinking
of areas. All of these effects will disrupt current vegeta-
tion, ecosystems, water balance, and human structures.
Fisheries. Warming could lead to a rise in production
unless changes in water properties would disrupt the
spawning grounds of fish in high latitudes. There could be
a substantial redistribution of important fish species.
Fisheries on the margin of profitability could prosper or
decline. Fishing seasons will lengthen, but most stocks
already are fully exploited.

Navigation and Transport. If sea-ice coverage is
reduced, coastal and river navigation will increase.
Opportunities for water transport, tourism, and trade will
increase. The Arctic Ocean could become a major trade
route. Seasonal transport across once-frozen land and
tivers may become more difficult or costly. Offshore oil
production should benefit from less ice.

land area. Athough similar in many ways, the two polar regions
are different in that the Arctic is a frozen ocean surrounded by
land, whereas the Antarctic is a frozen continent surrounded by

there are a few brief weeks of thaw when much of the Arctic
ground is awash with water and boggy. Overland travel is easy
when surfaces are firmly frozen but becomes more difficult in
summer when they are not. Surface transport over ice in seas,
lakes, and rivers much of the year must give way to transport
over water in summer. This marked seasonal contrast provides
two dramatically different environments, which are a challenge

The Arctic, however, has been populated for thousands of years

"The Antarctic, for the purposes of this document, comprises the
Antarctic continent, the surrounding Southern Ocean, south of
55°S, and the Sub-Antarctic islands (e.g., Campbell Island,
Heard Island, South Georgia Islands). It is the driest, windiest,
coldest, and cleanest continent and covers around 14 million
km? (UNEP, 1997). It is devoid of trees. Its boundary is some-
times taken to coincide with the Antarctic Convergence, which
roughly parallels the mean February air isotherm of 10°C and
is the northern boundary of the Antarctic marine ecosystem.
The area is managed by the Consultative Parties to the
Antarctic Treaty to the dedication of science and peace (UNEP,
1997.) The Arctic, for the purposes of this document, is defined
as the area within the Arctic Circle; it includes the boreal
forests and discontinuous permafrost, although some authors
prefer to use the area north of the natural tree line—which
coincides approximately with the mean July air isotherm of
10°C (Sugden, 1982). The Arctic areas of North America, Asia,
and Europe are included here, rather than in other regional

"The overwhelming characteristic of polar regions, in terms of
both intensity and duration, is the cold. The long winter night
ensures very low temperatures in winter. However, warm
North Atlantic water flows into the Arctic Ocean at about 500
m water depth at a temperature of +2 to +4°C in the Fram Strait
area and remains near 0°C even after reaching the other side of
the Arctic. The polar regions show large seasonal variations in
incoming solar radiation, from none during the winter to 24
hours of sunlight at mid-summer. The poles receive less solar
radiation annually than the equator, but in their respective mid-
summers the daily totals are greater than at other places on
earth. The high albedo of polar regions, from the persistent
snow and ice and the large loss of long-wave radiation due to
the exceptional clarity and dryness of the atmosphere, is a key
factor in the surface energy budget and ensures a net loss of
radiation in all or most of the months of the year. The loss is
compensated through transport of sensible and latent heat from
lower latitudes, usually within cyclones, and by heat carried
within ocean currents. Because of the lack of transport of warm
current to the Southern Ocean and the pressure of strong west-
erlies, which blocks heat supply over the Antarctic, the
Antarctic is colder than the Arctic. Summer temperatures in
most of the Antarctic continent remain well below freezing. In
the Arctic, however, rapid and strong snowmelt produces a
large influx of fresh water to the rivers and Arctic Ocean in the
spring and summer and supports a burst of life during a brief
and intense summer. Important circulation systems of the
world’s oceans are driven by sinking cold water at the periph-
ery of polar regions.

winter temperatures, with about a 2°C warming trend over
nearly 100 years of recorded data. This trend is supported by
the annual temperature record of Figure A-5 in Annex A.
Figure 3-2 is less definitive in depicting a clear warming trend
in the Antarctic, but it should be noted that the data base for
this record is more limited, consisting mostly of data from near
the Antarctic Peninsula. Borehole temperature measurements

everywhere. Later freeze-up and earlier break-up dates for

"Ice cores from the Arctic and Antarctic provide a particularly
valuable archive of past climate and are direct evidence for the
amount of increases in carbon dioxide (CO,), methane (CH,),
and nitrous oxide (N20). There is evidence from these records
of rapid warming ~11,500 years ago, at the end of the last
glacial period. Recent results (Cuffey et al., 1995; Johnsen et
al., 1995) suggest that the temperature changes were larger
than previously thought; that the coldest parts of the last glacial
period could have been as much as 21°C colder than the pre-
sent temperature in central Greenland; and that temperatures
increased by more than 10°C in a few decades. There is evi-
dence of an even more rapid change in the precipitation pat-
tern, rapid reorganizations in atmospheric circulation, and peri-
ods of rapid warming during the past 20,000 years. Surface
water salinity and temperature have exhibited parallel changes
that resulted in reduced oceanic convection in the North
Atlantic and in reduced strength of the global conveyor belt
ocean circulation (IPCC 1996, WG I, Section 3.6.4).

"The Greenland ice sheet, which has no floating ice shelves of
consequence, is different from the Antarctic ice sheets. Ice loss
from surface melting and runoff is of the same order of magni-
tude as loss from iceberg calving. Thus, climate change in
Greenland could have immediate effects on the surface mass
balance of the ice sheet through melting and runoff as well as
through accumulation. If there is warming, both the melt rates
at the margins and the accumulation rates in the interior should
increase. The former rate is expected to dominate. Thus, the
mass balance could become negative (IPCC 1996, WG II,

"In the Antarctic, where the sea-ice cover is divergent and land
boundaries are less important, it is more reasonable to suppose
that the main effect of global warming will be a simple retreat
of the ice edge southward. Even here, however, a complex set

ature changes. The balance of lead concentration, upper ocean
structure, and pycnocline depth adjusts itself to minimize the
impact of changes, tending to preserve an ice cover even
though it may be thinner and more diffuse (IPCC 1996, WG II,
Section 7.4.5). The modeling of Gordon and O’Farrell (1997)
demonstrates an ultimate reduction in Antarctic sea ice of
about 25% for a doubling of CO,, with the ice retreating fairly
evenly around the continent.

Shelf indicate that the flux of high-salinity shelf water (HSSW)
is responsible for the net melting at the ice shelf’s base. As
rates of sea-ice formation decrease during warmer winters, the
flux of HSSW beneath the ice shelf is reduced. Subjected to
less warm water flux, the sub-ice cavity will cool. Nicholls
concludes that a moderate warming of the climate could, in
fact, lead to a basal thickening of the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf,
perhaps increasing its longevity.

"Increased temperatures in the Arctic are likely to shorten the
duration of ice cover on Arctic lakes. A longer open-water peri-
od, together with warmer summer conditions, will increase
evaporative loss. Some patchy wetlands and shallow lakes owe
their existence to a positive water balance and the presence of
an impermeable permafrost substrate that inhibits deep perco-
lation; enhanced evaporation and ground thaw will cause some
to disappear (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 7.4.4). If there is
decreased precipitation and lower flood frequency, the
Mackenzie Delta in the Canadian arctic could shrink in sever-
al decades (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 10.5.2), although the

"In Antarctica, temperatures are so low that comparatively little
surface melting occurs on the continental ice sheet; ice loss is
mainly by iceberg calving, the rates of which are determined
by dynamic processes involving long response times (thou-
sands of years). Even if Antarctica were to warm in the future,
its mass balance is expected to become more positive: The rise
in temperature would be insufficient to initiate melt but would
increase snowfall (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 7.4). Little
change in Antarctic ice sheets is expected over the next 50
years, although longer-term behavior—including that of West
Antarctic ice—remains uncertain, and some instability is pos-
sible. Some areas of Antarctica may show a pronounced
change and dynamic response. The Antarctic Peninsula, for
instance, receives 28% of the continent’s snowfall and experi-
ences warmer temperatures and summer melting at sea level. A

There could also be reduced ice thickness. The maximum

longer fetches are available, wave heights would increase (e.g.,
the proportion of waves in excess of 6 m would rise from 16%

"Predicting the future character of moving pack ice is a difficult
problem because dynamics (ocean and wind currents), rather
than thermodynamics (radiation and heat components), deter-
mine its average thickness. Wind stress acting on the ice sur-
face causes the ice cover to open up to form leads (ice-free
areas). Later, under convergent stress, refrozen leads and thin-
ner ice elements are crushed to form pressure ridges.
Exchanges of heat, salt, and momentum are all different from
those that would occur in fast-ice cover. The area-averaged
growth rate of ice is dominated (especially in autumn and early
winter, when much lead and ridge creation take place) by the
small fraction of the sea surface occupied by ice less than 1 m
thick (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 7.4.5).

well. Given these limitations in existing ice modeling, some
authors estimate that with a doubling of greenhouse gases, sea

limited information available does not provide evidence of
detectable change in the thickness of Antarctic sea ice (IPCC

the Antarctic Peninsula (Jacobs and Comiso, 1993).
Measurements from a series of submarine transects near the

some boreal lands, it extends to considerable depths. It also is
present under shallow polar seabeds, in ice-free areas in
Antarctica, on some sub-Antarctic islands, and in many moun-

enlarge for decades to centuries because of wave action and
continued thermal erosion of the banks. Liquefaction of the
thawed layer will result in mudflows on slopes in terrain that is
poorly drained or contains ice-rich permafrost. On steeper
slopes there also will be landslides. Winter discharge of
groundwater often leads to ice formation. This formation is

America. Should the climate continue to warm, the vegetation
will likely be different from today. When lichens and mosses—
which tend to be suppressers of evapotranspiration—are
replaced by transpiring plants, evaporative losses will increase.
Enhanced evaporation will lower the water table, which would

decrease, as has been directly observed (Brown and Coté,
1992). However, if snow thickness is increased to the point
where not all of it is melted in summer, more protection may
be conferred on the ice surface—which could lead to an
increase, rather than a decrease, in equilibrium ice thickness
(IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 7.4.5). This scenario also would
increase the stability of the upper mixed layer of the ocean,

"Thawing of permafrost deepens the active layer, allowing
greater infiltration and water storage, especially for rain that
falls during the thawed period. Warming of the ground also will
lead to the formation of unfrozen zones within the permafrost
that provide porousness to enhance groundwater flow and
increase chemical weathering and nutrient release. The chemi-
cal composition and amount of groundwater discharge may be
changed as subpermafrost or intrapermafrost water is connect-

should be available to maintain baseflow, further extending the
stream-flow season. With earlier snowmelt, the seasonality of
river flows will be different (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 7.5.1).
Because many of the major river systems are north-flowing and
cross several climate zones that may respond differently to cli-

losses are projected in the area of boreal
forests despite their encroachment into current

a net loss of about 25% in boreal coverage

the vegetation of lichens and mosses. Meltwater in the area
helps to support herbaceous species such as grass. Some

super-cooling or anhydrobiosis mechanisms (Walton and

nutrients is maintained. For other species, there appear to be
significant disadvantages. For example, in southern latitudes,

reduce its extent, in turn affecting the distribution and reducing
the abundance and productivity of krill. Krill is the fundamen-

ozone-depleting substances, including chlorofluorocarbons.
The low human and species populations in the Antarctic have

Climate change may further ozone depletion. The cooling of
the stratosphere is likely to increase this depletion with current

However, the solar angle during the spring period is very low.
This factor may minimize the penetration of UV-B radiation in

on the same species. Positive effects such as extended feeding
areas and seasons in higher latitudes, more-productive high lat-
itudes, and lower winter mortality may be offset by negative
factors that alter established reproductive patterns, breeding
habitats, disease vectors, migration routes, and ecosystem rela-
tionships (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 8.3.2).

"Furthermore, recent evidence indicates that the extent of sea-
sonal sea ice, at least in some areas of the Northern
Hemisphere, is retreating. This information, coupled with pre-
dictions of warming from GCMs, suggests that current barriers
to gene flow among marine mammal stocks in the Arctic may
change dramatically in the next 50 years. Although this shift
may not result in a reduction in abundance at the species level,
it could very well change the underlying population structure
of many species of Arctic whales and seals, which will greatly
affect their management.

"In polar regions, the number of dominant fish species is small;
many species of low abundance are typical of tropical regions,
with the exception of upwelling areas. Only 15-20 commer-
cially important species in the Arctic or Antarctic Oceans are
recorded, whereas the numbers increase to about 50 and
16-450 in the boreal and tropic areas, respectively (Laevastu,
et al., 1996). The poleward distribution of fish due to climate
warming generally expands fishing areas. This expansion
might produce better yields of fish production. In the higher
latitudes, however, spawning grounds of cold-water species
that are very sensitive to the temperature change might be
destroyed by changes in water properties.
"	Text
"The basic limiting factors for fish production in polar and sub-
polar regions are light and temperature. Warming in high lati-
tudes should lead to longer growing periods, increased growth
rates, and ultimately, perhaps, increases in the general produc-
tivity of these regions (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 16.2.2.2).
On the other hand, the probability of nutrient loss resulting
from reduced deep-water exchange could result in reduced pro-
ductivity in the long term. Again, this complexity highlights
the importance of changes in temperature for patterns of circu-
lation. Global warming could have especially strong impacts
on the regions of oceanic subpolar fronts, where temperature
increases in deep water could lead to a substantial redistribu-
tion of pelagic and benthic communities, including commer-
cially important fish species (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section
8.3.2).

"Fedoulov et al. (1996) proposed the following mechanism as a
hypothesis to explain how ice, ocean, and atmospheric compo-
nents of the Southern Ocean affect krill distribution. Krill usu-
ally are more abundant in the southern Scotia Sea along the
Weddell Scotia Confluence (WSC), so it is likely that the cur-
rents play a key role in krill transport to South Georgia from
the Antarctic Peninsula. The WSC zone extends northward in
the eastern Scotia Sea, and this colder water penetrates along
the southeastern shelf of South Georgia. The position of the
WSC is thought to be determined by the intensity of the
Weddell gyre, which in turn is driven by the formation of dense
and cold Weddell water. The main factor in the creation of the
cold Weddell water is increased salinity resulting from ice for-
mation. Hence, the dominance of a warm or cold year reflects
the intensity of the Weddell gyre and consequently the general
position of the WSC. It is reasonable to suppose that ice can
start to influence krill distribution when it is close to or covers
the area of the WSC. Ice cover modifies the mechanism of drift
current formation and creates favorable (northern ice-edge
position) or unfavorable (southern ice-edge position) condi-
tions for krill transport to South Georgia.

"Antarctica, the krill fishery—which is regulated by the current
ice-free period—could become more attractive to nations not
already involved (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 16.2.2.3). Fishery
Statistics may be more valuable for the analyses of interannual
and long-term fluctuations of marine populations than was pre-
viously thought. Time series of catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE)
statistics from the commercial krill fishery operating around
South Georgia during 1973-1993 have been used for consider-
ing the hypothesis that fluctuations in the abundance of krill in
the Scotia Sea area are related to environmental changes. A con-
sistent correlation has been found between the various CPUE
indices and ice-edge positions: The further south the ice-edge
occurred during the winter-spring season, the lower the CPUE
values in the following fishing season. The most extreme
expression of this relationship was the lack of a krill fishery in
1978 and 1984, when the ice did not extend far north during the
previous winter. By contrast, in 1978 and 1984 the March ice-
edge reached its northern limit at 50°S, preceding high CPUE
values in 1979 and 1985. A consistent relationship also exists
between CPUE and water temperature. Warm-water tempera-
ture in the South Georgia shelf area in January—February corte-
sponded to lower CPUE values in the same year. There also is
significant correlation between air transport in late spring and
CPUE in the next year. For example, a prevalence of southerly
meridional air transport precedes high CPUE values (Fedoulov
et al., 1996). It must be emphasized, however, that the physical
regimes of the sub-Antarctic region in the vicinity of South
Georgia are very complicated, and this model may not be
applicable to the entire Antarctic.

many rivers are used as solid roads during winter. Warmer win-

"Agriculture in polar lands is severely limited by the harsh cli-
mate. Although agriculture is not practiced in Antarctica, some
agriculture currently takes place in the Arctic. If temperature
were to increase and result in earlier last-freeze dates and later
first-frost dates, conditions for Arctic agriculture should
become more favorable, although climate conditions will still
make agriculture in the Arctic extremely difficult. There
already are indications in Alaska, based on the last 70 years, for
an increase in the length of the growing season (Sharratt,
1992). Although considerably more land will be available for
farming if temperatures increase, moisture and nutrient prob-
lems will limit the productivity of these areas (Mills, 1994).
The more immediate effects are likely to be on plants such as
cotton grass that are important to caribou and reindeer popula-

Ocean as a major trade route (IPCC 1996, WG II, Technical

opening of both the Northwest Passage and the Russian
Northern Sea Route for up to 100 days a year. One French
experiment indicated that the use of the Northeast Passage in
ice-free seasons shortened by about 3 weeks the shipping dura-
tion between Europe and Far East Asia compared with the pre-
sent route (i.e., via the Suez Canal). Although a reduction of
sea ice may be a boon to international shipping and consumers
in East Asia, North America, and Western Europe, policies
designed to limit the total burden of pollutants entering the
Arctic environment from ports, ship operations, and accidents
may have to be developed (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 8

"Currently, ice-breaking efforts are an expensive aspect of navi-
gation in the Arctic. Interannual variability prevents the elimi-
nation of these programs unless extreme changes in sea ice
should occur. Some ice-breaking programs in some areas may
be cut back with moderate warming of the Arctic. In other areas,
costs may rise to keep newly available routes open longer. A
disappearance of sea ice south of Labrador would eliminate
Canadian Coast Guard ice-breaking requirements. This would
mean an annual saving of CDN$15~20 million. Even larger
savings also can be expected in the former Soviet Union if ice
retreats from the shores of the Kara, Laptev, and Chukchi Seas.
Similar savings would accrue along the Gulf of Bothnia with
the absence of ice. The effect of annual warming on ice calving
(simulated using a simple degree-day model) shows that for
every 1°C of warming there would be a 1° latitude retreat of ice-
berg occurrence in the Atlantic Ocean. In the Southern Ocean,
any effects of reduced sea ice will be economically less pro-
nounced (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 7.5.3).

"Reduced sea-ice extent and thickness would increase the sea-
sonal duration of polar navigation on rivers and in coastal areas
that are presently affected by seasonal ice cover (IPCC 1996,
WG II, Section 7.5). Improved opportunities for water trans-
port, tourism, and trade at high latitudes are expected as a result.
These activities will have important implications for the people,
economies, and navies of nations along the Arctic rim (IPCC
1996, WG II, Chapter 7 Executive Summary). Reduced sea ice
will provide safer approaches for tourist ships and new oppor-
tunities for sightseeing around Antarctica and the Arctic (IPCC
1996, WG II, Section 7.5.5). Increased calving of icebergs from
the Antarctic Peninsula may, however, affect navigation and
shipping lanes north of the Antarctic Convergence. Decreased
sea-ice extent around Antarctica could make it easier for tourist
vessels with less preparedness for sea-ice travel to visit the con-
tinent and surrounding islands. Some may be ill-prepared to
navigate and respond to the extreme and highly variable envi-
ronmental conditions in the Southern Ocean. There is no clear
consensus, however, about whether the frequency of icebergs,
and their danger to shipping, will change with global warming
(IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 7.4). Increased precipitation may

Road maintenance related to permafrost thawing already is a
major problem with high associated costs in many sub-Arctic

changes in the landscapes at northern high latitudes. These
changes may be exacerbated where they are accompanied by
growing numbers of people and increased economic activity
(IPCC 1996, WG IL, Chapter 7 Executive Summary). There
could be a northward spreading of agricultural, forestry, and
mining activities—resulting in increased population and inten-
sified settlement patterns—into Arctic areas. The rate of such
spread is an issue of debate and will depend on social and eco-
nomic factors, intervention strategies, and natural processes.
Marine, road, rail, and air links would have to be expanded
accordingly. Although this development would entail substan-

the growth of coral reef biota may be sufficient to adapt to sea-

"Ecosystems: In responding to climate change, Australasia’s
biota may face a greater rate of long-term change than ever
before. They also must respond in a highly altered landscape
fragmented by urban and agricultural development. There is
ample evidence for significant potential impacts. Alterations in
soil characteristics, water and nutrient cycling, plant produc-
tivity, species interactions (competition, predation, parasitism,
etc.), and composition and function of ecosystems are highly
likely responses to increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide
(CO,) concentration and temperature and to shifts in rainfall
regimes. These changes would be exacerbated by any increas-
es in fire occurrence and insect outbreaks.

"Prediction of climate change effects is very difficult because of
the complexity of ecosystem dynamics. Although Australasia’s
biota and ecosystems are adapted to the region’s high climate
variability (exemplified in arid and ENSO-affected areas), it is
unclear whether this will provide any natural adaptation advan-
tage. Many species will be able to adapt through altered ecosys-
tem relationships or migration, but such possibilities may not
exist in some cases, and reduction of species diversity is highly
likely. Climate change will add to existing problems such as
land degradation, weed infestations, and pest animals and gen-
erally will increase the difficulties and uncertainty involved in
managing these problems.

maximum temperature tolerance and are likely to suffer
increasingly as the temperature increases. The possibility of
overall decreased rainfall in Australia would negatively affect
rangeland pastoralism and irrigated agriculture (which is a
major source of production). Any changes in global produc-

have major economic impacts.

"Coastal zones: The impacts on coastal zones of sea-level rise
and climate change include inundation, riverine flooding, saline
intrusion, erosion, and wave damage. The impacts of changes in
weather conditions (winds, waves, storms, and storm surge)
may be comparable to those of sea-level rise alone. Beaches,
estuaries and coastal wetlands, and reefs—including the Great
Barrier Reef—have adapted naturally to past changes in climate
and sea level. However, in the future they are likely to face
faster rates of change, and in many cases landward migration
will be blocked by human land uses and infrastructure. Impacts
will be complex, both physically and socioeconomically, and
will vary greatly from place to place. There is potential for con-
siderable damage to the region’s low-lying coastal settlements
and infrastructure where populations, tourism, and capital
investment are large and growing. New Zealand also is exposed
to impacts on its Pacific island territories, including the eventu-
al possibility of environmental refugee fluxes. Some parts of
Australasia’s coastline, including a number of coastal cities and
indigenous communities in low-lying coastal settlements and
islands, are highly vulnerable.

"Hydrology and water resources: The four hydrological situa-
tions of most concern to the region are drought-prone areas,
flood-prone urban areas, low-lying islands, and alpine snow-
fields. Model simulations suggest changes of as much as t20%
in soil moisture and runoff in Australia by 2030, with consid-
erable variation from place to place and season to season and
with the possibility of an overall reduction in average runoff.
Water shortages would sharpen competition among various
uses of water, especially where large diversions are made for
economic purposes. One study shows Australia’s major
Murray-Darling River system facing constraints on existing
irrigation uses and/or harm to the riverine environment. More
frequent high-rainfall events would enhance groundwater
recharge and dam-filling events but also would increase the
impacts of flooding, landslides, and erosion. A preliminary
study for an urban area near Sydney showed a tenfold increase
in the potential damage of the “100-year” flood under a dou-
bled CO, scenario. Water supplies on atolls and low-lying
islands are vulnerable to saltwater intrusion of groundwater
from rising sea levels and to possible rainfall reductions.
Reduced snow amounts and a shorter snow season appear like-

the viability of the ski industry. The glaciers of New Zealand’s

and on crops presently growing near or above their optimum
temperatures, whereas New Zealand—a cooler, wetter, mid-

the range of climates arising from the large latitudinal range,
the continentality of Australia, and the mountainous, maritime
nature of New Zealand. Australia has mainly rainfall-limited
ecosystems (both natural and agricultural), although high tem-

growth of about 1.6% per annum is higher than the average

of the population live in urban and suburban areas, mostly
near the coast. Half of Australia’s population lives in just four
coastal cities. Average population density is low; even when
arid areas are excluded, it is only about 5 persons/km? for
Australia (see Annex D). Both countries have strong relation-
ships with Pacific island countries, in some cases extending
to specific constitutional responsibilities, and they are home

"The region’s climate is strongly influenced by its oceanic con-
text. Northern Australia, lying just south of the Western Pacific
oceanic “warm pool,” experiences tropical conditions, with a
summer monsoon (Sturman and Tapper, 1996). Tropical
cyclones (averaging six per year) are a major concern for
northern coastal regions. Cyclones can track southward as far
as New Zealand, bringing very high rainfalls (Sinclair, 1993a,
b). Western and central Australia experience generally clear,
dry conditions owing to large-scale subsidence. In the winter
half-year, eastward-moving anticyclones cross the continent,
and northern areas are influenced by mild, dry, southeast
tradewinds. In the summer half-year, the anticyclones cross at
higher latitudes—bringing fine weather to southern Australia
and to New Zealand.

"Primary industries are a cornerstone of the region’s economy.
These industries include Australia’s low-input pastoralism
(grain, meat, and wool) and irrigated agriculture and horticul-
ture and New Zealand’s meat, wool, dairy, and horticulture
industries, together with the associated processing industries in
both countries. Forestry, fishing, and tropical crops also are
important. Australia is a major exporter of coal, as well as ener-
gy-intensive iron, steel, and aluminium. Coal reserves are
about 100 billion tonnes, with annual production of about 200
million tonnes, mostly for export. About two-thirds of New
Zealand’s electricity is hydro-generated. The bulk of the
region’s exports is raw or processed agricultural and mining
products; in this respect the regional economies are anomalous
among OECD countries, being more like the less developed

regional exports are heavily exposed to fluctuations in world

Australia. Mountains rising to 2000-3000 m transverse to the
prevailing westerly winds result in very wet conditions in
western areas and drier “rainshadow” conditions in eastern
areas. In the west of the South Island, annual rainfall can be as
much as 12,000 mm, with high runoff, steep torrents, exten-
sive permanent snow fields at high altitudes, and fast-moving

rainfall may be as low as 500 mm. The eastern plains experi-
ence summer drought, which sometimes extends to spring and

"Analyses have shown that, along with other parts of the world,
the region’s minimum daily temperatures have tended to rise
faster than the maximum daily temperatures, which means that
the day-night difference (the diurnal temperature range) has
decreased noticeably in most places, by up to 1°C over the past
40 years (Karl et al., 1992; Salinger, 1995; Torok and Nicholls,
1996; Zheng et al., 1997). The trend in diurnal temperature
range has been strongest since the 1950s and appears to be a
result of increasing cloudiness—the source of which is unclear
at present (IPCC 1996, WG I, Section 8.5.3). In Australia, there
has been a decrease in the number of clear days since at least
the 1950s, with the largest declines occurring in spring
(Plummer et al., 1997), and cloud cover has increased by 5%
overall since 1910 (Jones, 1991).

"An important feature of the region’s climate is the ENSO phe-
nomenon, which causes high year-to-year variability, especial-
ly of rainfall in northern and eastern Australia. The ENSO phe-
nomenon involves the interaction of the tropical Pacific Ocean
with the global atmosphere and shifts in the major climatic pat-
terns of the globe every 2-5 years or so (McBride and Nicholls,
1983; Rasmusson and Wallace, 1983; Bureau of Meteorology,
1989; McCreary and Anderson, 1991; Trenberth, 1991).
During “El Nifo” years—which are marked by unusually
warm sea surface temperatures in the tropical eastern Pacific
Ocean—Australia experiences reduced rainfall and extensive
and often prolonged droughts, with severe impacts on rural
communities and agricultural production. Major wildfires also
can occur. At the opposite phase of the oscillation, during “La

"Owing to its generally low rainfall and low runoff and the
large seasonal and ENSO-related variations, Australia’s
hydrological features are significantly different from almost
all other regions and continents (Finlayson and McMahon,
1988; McMahon and Finlayson, 1991; Fleming, 1995;
Thomas and Bates, 1997). The variability of Australian rain-
fall and runoff is among the greatest in the world: two to four
times those of northwestern Europe and North America for the
same climatic zones. Compared with other nations, the fre-
quency and duration of drought is extreme, though these are
interspersed with sequences of above-average rainfall. About
25% of the variance in annual rainfall is attributable to the
ENSO phenomenon. Most of Australia’s major rivers have
ceased to flow at least once during the past 100 to 200 years,
and groundwater levels show remarkable variations through
time.

the global mean trend (IPCC 1996, WG I, Section 3.2.1). There
are large variations in decadal averages (Figure A-6), presum-
ably of natural origin. The largest increases have occurred
since about 1950. Regional trends in intraseasonal and interan-
nual temperature variability were mixed and generally not sta-

Australian temperature data may be systematically too high,
owing to instrumentation error, which may partially mask the
real temperature rise for Australia derived from these early data
(IPCC 1996, WG I, Section 3.2.2.1). Ocean temperatures in the

"Summary: Climate modeling and climate change scenarios for
the region are relatively well developed. For Australia, the
recently revised (1996) CSIRO scenarios for 2030 indicate
temperature increases of 0.3-1.4°C and rainfall changes of up
to 10% in magnitude (decreases in winter, increases or
decreases in summer, and overall a tendency for decreases).
The projected changes for 2070 are about twice those of the
2030 changes. Increases in the intensity of heavy rainfall
events are indicated. For New Zealand, the temperature
increases are expected to be similar to those for Australia, but
the recent revision indicates the possibility of an increase in
westerly winds (unlike the decreases of previous scenarios)—
and hence precipitation increases in the west and precipitation
decreases in the east. The changes in scenarios serve to cau-
tion against overinterpretation of impact studies based on any
single scenario.

behavior, mid-latitude storms, and other atmospheric circula-

depressions along the east coast of Australia, which may be due
to local circulation changes (Hopkins and Holland, 1997;
Leighton et al., 1997). Increased numbers of tropical cyclones
over the past few decades have been reported in the southwest
Pacific region (north of New Zealand), with the greatest
increases for the stronger cyclones, but there are doubts about
the homogeneity of the available database, partly owing to
improvements in observation capabilities in recent decades
(Thompson ef al., 1992; Radford et al., 1996). In the Australian
tegion (105-160°E), the total number of cyclones from the
1969-70 to the 1995-96 seasons has decreased, but the num-

use results from the older slab-ocean climate models as well as
from the newer coupled models. This is because there are still
some doubts about the reliability of the scenarios from the cou-
pled models (Whetton et al., 1996b). These doubts partly relate
to the observed latitudinal gradient of warming in the Southern
Hemisphere (IPCC 1996, WG, Section 3.2.2.3), which is more
like that in the slab-ocean GCMs, and to the simulated rainfall
decreases in summer over Australia—which are contrary to the
observed small increases this century. This disagreement could
be because the observed trends are not predominantly green-

"Any overall increase in temperature will tend to cause an
increase in the frequency of extremely high temperatures and a
decrease in the frequency of extremely low temperatures (e.g.,
frost) (IPCC 1996, WG I, Section 6.5.7). A similar effect will
apply to areas of overall rainfall increase, and vice versa for
areas of overall rainfall decrease. In addition, global climate
models tend to predict that in a warmer climate there will be
more high-intensity rainfall events, with more severe droughts
and floods in some places but less severe droughts and floods
in other places (Fowler and Hennessy, 1995; IPCC 1996, WG
I, Section 6.5.7). Where interannual variability in rainfall is
high, there may be more sensitivity to changes in the frequen-

“slab ocean” type—that is, they did not include an interactive
deep ocean. Very recently, the application of coupled ocean-
atmosphere GCMs and the use of updated IPCC (1996a) glob-
al warming scenarios has led to significant shifts in the pro-
jected changes of climate (CSIRO, 1996a). The CSIRO (1992)

GCMs (except for an improved version of F1), and five cou-

patterns of regional climate change derived from five general
circulation model (GCM) experiments—namely, J1, Fl, A3,
H3 of Table 1-1, and the Bureau of Meteorology Research
Center (BMRC) experiment of Coleman et al. (1994). For
2030, these gave warmings in Australia of 0.5-2.5°C for inland

southern coastal areas, and warmings in New Zealand of
0.5—-2.0°C in inland Canterbury and Otago and 0.5-1.5°C else-

from little change to as much as a 20% increase, and winter
precipitation projections showed as much as 10% change—but
the direction of change depended on the district. In New
Zealand, regardless of season, precipitation increases from
zero to about 20% were projected—except around Wellington,
the east coast of the North Island, South Canterbury, and

formerly successful species even if the climate remains within
their physiological tolerances (Peters, 1992). Ecosystems
whose “keystone” species are particularly sensitive to climate

migration is not an option for most of Australia’s predominant-

parts of tropical Australia where the latitudinal variation of
temperature is small and poleward migration is limited by
desert or land-use change; here the biota will increasingly

limited migration options, and escarpments, deserts, agricul-

may remove an existing limitation to species survival and per-

land rainforest streams. In contrast, upland rainforest streams
have a high diversity (Pearson et al., 1986) and appear to be
relatively resilient (Benson and Pearson, 1987; Rosser and
Pearson, 1995). A study in southeast Australia found that
droughts deplete introduced trout but not the native galaxiids,
resulting in an expansion of galaxiid populations downstream
with the death of trout (Closs and Lake, 1996); thus, with
increased drought the range of native fish in such small streams
might increase.

"In the lowland coastal rivers and floodplains of northern
Australia, the possibly lower rainfall projected by the revised
climate change scenarios (CSIRO, 1996a) would most likely
lead to greatly decreased biodiversity because it has been
found that poor wet seasons reduce the extent and duration of
inundation—which in turn has dramatic impoverishing effects
on the abundance and diversity of the biota. Drier conditions
would likely lead to a decrease in the problem of insect-borne
diseases, however. These floodplains may be particularly prone
to the impacts of sea-level rise (Steering Committee of the
Climate Change Study, 1995; Waterman, 1995), whereby
storm surges, cyclonic floods, and seawater intrusions could
devastate the freshwater biota. The possible effect of climate
change on the present invasion of floodplains by aquatic and
semi-aquatic weeds (Lonsdale, 1994; Miller and Wilson,
1995), or on future invasions, is unclear.

"Aquatic ecosystems are exposed to the primary effects of local
changes in temperature, sunshine, wind, and so forth and to a
wide range of secondary effects, particularly from changes in
hydrology and waterborne materials. Increased water tempera-
tures, increased evaporation, and changes in inflows and flood-
ing would change the thermal and chemical structures of rivers
and lakes. These changes would directly affect the nutrient sta-
tus of aquatic ecosystems; the survival, reproduction, and
growth of organisms; the distribution and diversity of species;
and overall ecosystem productivity (IPCC 1996, WG II,
Sections 10.5, 10.6). Changes in rainfall produce dispropor-
tionate changes in runoff and in mean flows and levels of rivers
and some lakes; these effects might be exacerbated if the cli-
mate were to become more variable, with more frequent flood
and drought events. Sea-level rise is likely to have significant
effects on lowland aquatic ecosystems near the coasts. (Coral
reefs are discussed in Section 4.3.1.5.)

"Fire plays an important role in the composition, function, and
dynamics of many Australian ecosystems (IPCC 1996, WG II,
Section 1.5.1). For example, the importance of the length of
inter-fire interval has been repeatedly demonstrated
(Christensen and Kimber, 1975; Burgman and Lamont, 1992;
Gill and Bradstock, 1995; Morrison et al., 1995; Keith, 1996).
It has been strongly suggested that the risk of fire may increase
as the climate changes (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 1.3.1)
because of faciors such as higher temperatures and water
stress—though there remains much speculation about future
fire regimes owing to the uncertainty associated with the many
climatic and ecosystem variables involved (Williams and Gill,
1995). If fires become more frequent under climate change
(Beer and Williams, 1995; Pittock et al., 1997), species com-
position and structure could be altered, at least in southern
Australia. Changes in other components of the fire regime,
such as intensity (which could be affected by changes in fuel
loading) and season, likewise could affect species diversity.
Any increased fire occurrence also could present increased
risks to people and infrastructure in forested urban fringe areas
of southeastern Australia.

high diversity (Boon et al., 1990; Hillman and Shiel, 1991), and
off-channel wetlands may dry up for extensive periods and

where species are eliminated by drought, recolonization may be
slow (e.g., Boulton and Lake, 1992). The already increasing
salinity of the Murray-Darling system (Macumber, 1990) could
alter under a changed climate. Although much of the biota of its

coral reefs and their communities, migration to higher latitudes

bleaching, corals expel the symbiotic single-celled algae that
live within their tissues, and then sometimes die (Brown,

above normal, which is often associated with ENSO episodes.
The frequency of high-temperature episodes will increase as
mean temperatures gradually rise, which would result in more
frequent and widespread damage to corals—especially those
remote from a reliable supply of larvae of reef species or

impacts such as riverine runoff (Larcombe et al., 1996), high
solar irradiance (especially ultraviolet wavelengths) (Glynn,

"It has been predicted that, by itself, a rise in sea level might
benefit many reefs because corals on reef tops would have a
renewed and/or extended opportunity for vertical growth—
unlike the last several thousand years, when they have been
limited by sea level to exclusively horizontal growth
(Wilkinson and Buddemeier, 1994; Wilkinson, 1996). Thus,
the potential effect of sea-level rise over the next 50 years in
tidally limited reef-top coral habitats is an increase in living
coral cover and, in many cases, an increase in topographic
telief. This scenario is quite likely to be played out in sheltered
parts of many reefs, assuming that the majority of these reef-
top corals are not killed by increased temperature or other
causes (such as burial by sediments if high-intensity rainfall
events were to increase). Although the vertical growth of most
shallow corals will be able to keep pace with a rate of sea-level
tise of up to 5 cm per decade, the mechanisms for reef island
growth are not expected to keep pace with sea-level rise, and
therefore many low islands may eventually become uninhabit-
able (Wilkinson, 1996; see also Section 4.3.4).

"Adaptations to climate change may be categorized as either
“autonomous” adaptations—where biota and ecosystems
respond and change of their own accord—or “planned” or
“conscious” adaptations, undertaken by humans. The primary
option for conscious adaptation measures in respect to near-
natural ecosystems is land-use management. This includes
modification of land clearing, forestry practices, fire manage-
ment, rangeland animal stocking rates, pest animal manage-
ment, control of herbaceous and woody weeds, development of
corridors for species migration, resting and rehabilitating
degraded areas, and the consideration of climate change in
management plans for urban, coastal, catchment, and other
zones. Implementation of riparian (riverside) management
practices and selective planting of upslope source areas would
mitigate many of the adverse impacts of land development and
hydrological changes on water quality and habitat values of
streams, rivers, and ultimately lake and estuarine habitats.
Active manipulation of species generally will not be feasible in
the region’s extensive, lightly managed, natural ecosystems,
though in some circumstances—such as for endangered or
commercially important species—relocation to new and more
suitable habitats may be desirable and feasible.

their maximum temperature tolerance and are likely to suffer
increasingly as the temperature increases. The possibility of

increased CO, fertilization, higher temperatures, and changed

CO, concentration and temperature rises (but not necessarily
rainfall changes) and ignoring adaptive measures, it appears
that pasture productivity may generally increase (e.g., Greer et

remain about constant (e.g., Wang ef al., 1992; Rawson, 1995;

available, crop yields may benefit, with the beneficial effects of
higher CO, concentrations outweighing the reductions in yield
expected from shorter grain-filling periods associated with

However, if sufficiently longer-maturing cultivars cease to
become available due to greater warmings, yields may
decrease. This would happen first at low latitudes, and the effect
would increase as further warming occurs later in the next cen-

reduced risk of early- or late-season frost damage will allow
the use of later maturing cultivars with higher yield potential.
Warmer conditions will accelerate crop development, allowing
crops to avoid early- and late-season climatic risks and perhaps
providing better timing of harvesting to meet market needs

remains uncertain (Owensby, 1993). Pasture plants grown
under elevated CO, concentration always seem to have lower
protein (Arp and Berendse, 1993) and higher nonstructural car-
bohydrate contents (Lutze, 1996), which implies an impact on
the nutritional quality of the forage. In high-rainfall temperate
regions, particularly early in the growing season, most forage
is eaten as green sward (or products preserved from green
material), in which case the increased soluble carbohydrate
content would increase the digestibility and nutritional value of
the forage (Smith et a/., 1997). Reductions in feed quality may
occur through reductions in digestibility and increase in lignin
content of tropical grasses grown at higher temperatures
(Wilson, 1982) and increased stem-to-leaf ratios of plants
grown under high CO, levels (e.g., Morison and Gifford,

some times of year—suggesting an increased need for feed

buckling of railway lines and melting or softening of road tar
surfaces—but also would reduce the risks of winter snow and
ice on roads. Any changes in winds at flight levels would affect
aircraft operations and economics. More intense rainfalls
would cause more frequent landslides and blockages to rail and
road routes and might increase flooding impacts on airports,
roads, rail tracks, and bridges. Any increase in storm frequen-

vulnerable to climate change in several ways. Coastal resorts.

This is likely to lead to an increase in deaths, especially in
cities such as Melbourne that are subject to wide variability in
temperature, but insufficient information is available at present
to quantify this impact. There may be fewer deaths in winter
with warmer temperatures. For example, the winter excess in
coronary heart disease mortality in Australia and New Zealand

Ross River virus, and dengue. In southeastern Australia, epi-

heavy rainfall events increased. However, the relationship
between climate, vector distribution, and disease are complex.
For example, although the incidence of infection with Ross

of symptomatic disease may actually fall because individuals
who are infected as children remain asymptomatic and are
immune for life.

increase road accidents. Other waterborne illnesses—such as
viral, bacterial, and protozoal diarrhoea and cyanobacterial
poisoning—would be affected by any changes in water avail-
ability (due to flooding, droughts, and public water shortages).
Some disease vectors also are influenced by changes in water
availability. New Zealand currently is free of human arbovirus
infections (i.e., viruses borne by arthropods—ticks, mites,
etc.), but if temperature and rainfall alter it may become sus-
ceptible to infections that currently are common in Australia
(Weinstein et al., 1995). Vectors for dengue and malaria
already exist in Australia, and southward expansion of the vec-
tor populations with temperature increases would increase the
potential for insect-borne diseases to become more widely
established. These diseases are very sensitive to climate vari-

common in the western Pacific islands during relatively warm

social and economic disadvantage, which itself is a cause for
susceptibility. For example, many Australian Aborigines live in
remote areas, in poor housing, and are particularly susceptible
to infections related to deficiencies in water supply and sewage
disposal (Moss, 1994). Under some scenarios, these conditions
could worsen due to higher temperatures, changes in rainfall,
higher water tables, and rising sea levels. Reduced freshwater

"The health impacts of climate change will include economic
and social costs. These costs are difficult to quantify, but the
evidence suggests that the health impacts for the region are like-
ly to be relatively small compared to impacts from other dis-
eases and sources of mortality. At the same time, it should be
cautioned that there is considerable uncertainty in our current
knowledge of not only the likely direct impacts but also the
complexities of social responses to change and interaction with
other sectors. For example, there could be changes in the inci-
dence of zoonoses (vertebrate animal-mediated diseases) such
as leptospirosis, a concern in New Zealand, as farming systems
and zoonoses transmission alter in response to climate change.
Heat stress impacts will be affected by housing choices and
changing attitudes to air conditioning. More difficult to estimate
precisely—but possibly of greater importance to public health
in the long term—are the indirect effects of climate change,

(experiment F1, Table 1-1). Potential costs were estimated on the basis that the quarantine line would not be economically
sustainable because of the recurrent development of strains of ticks that are resistant to the chemicals used to control
them and the increasing difficulty of eradication under more favorable climatic conditions.

The number of ticks was estimated to increase in the southern part of the existing range—where they are limited by the
shortness of the warm season, which allows reproduction, and by severe winter mortality. Both of these constraints were
reduced by global warming; as a result, most of the estimated increases in costs would be sustained within the current
tick-infested area in Queensland. There was a parallel increase in the potential area affected by ticks in NSW. The final
estimates of potential national costs, in terms of net present value, ranged from A$18 million to A$192 million, but these

"Methods for integrated assessment have been explored at sev-

New Zealand—see Section 4.2.3) emerging from simulations
using slab-ocean GCMs and from the more comprehensive
coupled-ocean models (Whetton et a/., 1996a) has increased
the uncertainty regarding the “correct” scenario to use in
impact analyses (CSIRO, 1996a) and has thrown considerable
doubt on the predictions of many early impact studies (though
they remain valuable as sensitivity studies). As a consequence,
there is a growing recognition that integrated assessments for
Australia and New Zealand need to be carried out within a

with an equilibrium doubling of CO,, the impacts amount to an annual reduction of several percent of GDP in many

ditions and include some account of international trade effects in agriculture but not of interactions between the different
impacts or adaptation responses. It should be noted that these results have been strongly criticized—first on the basis of
inadequate representation of the full range of impacts and second because many researchers hold the view that the
importance of nonmarket goods, especially lives and quality of life, cannot be expressed in monetary terms.

"Updated values of the SAR estimates of the annual impact for Australia and New Zealand combined fall in the range of
-1.2% to -3.8% of GDP, depending on economic model assumptions (Fankhauser and Tol, 1997). The real uncertainty in
these estimates is much greater than the range given. Most of the impact arises from health and environmental effects,
which do not appear in national economic accounts. At face value, these figures indicate substantial negative effects on
Australasia’s economy. Furthermore, they may seriously underestimate the true total impact because they do not include
a number of impacts that are potentially important to Australasia—such as changes in weeds, pests, and diseases; storm
surges; and urban flooding. In addition, damages may increase nonlinearly with increased global warming, so the
impacts and costs could rise faster than the rate of warming. On the other hand, adaptations to climate change, which
will act to reduce total costs, also are not included in the calculations.

"In principle, the total potential economic impact of climate change on the world (or a region or country) can be found by
deriving a comprehensive monetary estimate—where all of the known impacts, positive and negative, are expressed in a
dollar value and combined (IPCC 1996, WG III, Section 6.1.2.). For marketed goods and services (for example,
increased agricultural production, land loss due to sea-level rise, or energy savings in winter), this calculation is more or
less straightforward because the prices are known. In the case of nonmarketed goods and services (for example, wetland
loss or mortality changes), monetary estimates of impacts can be obtained through examining market transactions where
such goods or services are implicitly traded (¢.g., the higher price of a house with a good view) or through interviewing
people for their preferences. That is, human preferences are expressed by people’s willingness to pay to secure a benefit
or their willingness to accept compensation in exchange for a loss. In OECD countries, such valuation techniques are

well established and have been widely applied.

"Crop mixes and production zones will be redistributed,
and the use of water, fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides
will shift with them.

Conflicting demands for water—for instance, between
irrigation and domestic supply in southern Europe—will
need to be taken into account.

Changes in potential production translate in a complex
way to farmer incomes and food prices, depending on
technology, farmer adaptation, world markets, and agri-
cultural policies.

"Climate Change. Climate model projections suggest a
general increase in temperature, greatest in northerly lati-
tudes. Precipitation changes are considerably more uncer-
tain, but one could expect generally wetter conditions in
the north, drier conditions in the south, and increasingly
drier conditions from west to east. Winter precipitation
may be greater than today, while summer precipitation is
likely to decrease.

Sensitive Regions. As water is one of the main integrat-
ing factors for many environmental and economic sys-
tems in Europe, currently sensitive areas in terms of their
hydrology include the Mediterranean region, the Alps,
northern Scandinavia, certain coastal zones, and central
and eastern Europe. A changing climate is likely to
enhance water-related stresses in these already sensitive
regions.
"	List
"Evapotranspiration will increase in a warmer climate, with
potential reductions in water availability; however, the
response of hydrological systems depends on the distribu-
tion of precipitation (highly variable, as suggested above)
and storage capacity.

Many regions in the southern and interior parts of Europe
could experience a general decrease in runoff, though the
change in runoff may range between -5% and +12%.
More droughts could be expected in southern Europe, and
the potential for winter and springtime flooding could be
greater in northern and northwestern Europe. However,
this pattern is not the same for all general circulation mod-
els (GCMs).

Intrusion of saline waters into coastal aquifers and the
expected reduction in precipitation could aggravate the
problem of freshwater supply in some areas.

Snow and ice are likely to decrease in many places, with
consequences for the timing and amount of runoff in river
basins, as well as winter tourism.

Demand for water could increase in summer. Supply could
decrease, though there may be regional differences in
which storage capacity plays an important role.

Pollution is a major stress factor for many European
rivers, and a decrease in discharge would increase pollu-
tant concentrations, leading to reductions in water quality.
"	List
"With the exception of parts of Scandinavia and the
Russian Federation, Europe has few genuine natural
ecosystems, Natural ecosystems generally are confined to
poor soils and are fragmented and disturbed; consequent-
ly, they tend to be more sensitive to climate change than
agriculture, which occupies the most fertile soils.

The reaction of European ecosystems to global change is
difficult to predict because there are a number of interac-
tions and feedback loops between increasing temperatures,
decreasing availability of soil water, and increasing carbon
dioxide (CO,) concentrations.

Increasing CO, concentration increases the productivity of
plants with C3; metabolism under laboratory conditions
(for most agricultural plants, except maize and millet).
However, many other factors come into play under field
conditions, such as water and nutrient stress, increased
respiration losses, and interactions between species.
Therefore, the overall change in productivity can only be
predicted if these interacting environmental conditions are
taken into account. Many studies indicate that CO,
increases alone may have relatively little impact under
field conditions.

The forests in many parts of Europe are affected by high
deposition rates of nitrogen. Their productivity is not
only a function of climatic factors but of the change in
nitrogen deposition, which can both act as a fertilizer
and cause disturbances to many processes within the
ecosystem.

"Sea-level rise will place additional stress on coastal zones
already stressed by other factors (urbanization, coastal
developments, pollution, etc.).

The level of impact will depend on the adaptation capac-
ity (e.g., the ability of systems to move inland) and poli-
cies of individual countries (e.g., trade-offs between lands
that are not considered important and those that need to be
protected).

Sensitive zones include areas already close to or below
mean sea level (such as the Dutch and German North Sea
coastlines, the Po River delta, and the Ukrainian Black Sea
coast), areas with low intertidal variation (such as the
coastal zones of the Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean),
and coastal wetlands.

Changes in the nature and frequency of storm surges, par-
ticularly in the North Sea, are likely to be of considerable
importance for low-lying coastal areas.

Other Infrastructure, Activities, Settlements

Energy. Changing hydrology will impact those energy and
industrial production sectors that depend on water for
cooling. There is a potential for increased energy demand
related to cooling in summer, and decreased energy
demand related to heating in winter. Such changes would
lead to shifts in peak energy demand.

Urbanization. Infrastructure, buildings, and cities
designed for cooler climates will have to be adjusted to
warmer conditions, particularly heat waves, to maintain
current functions.

continents. The most heavily populated area includes a belt
originating in England and continuing eastward through
Belgium and the Netherlands, Germany, the Czech Republic,
Slovakia, Poland, and into the European part of Russia.
Northern Italy also has a high population density. The average
annual growth rate for the European population during the
1980s was only about 0.3%; by comparison, in the same peri-
od, the population of Asia grew by about 1.8% per year and
that of North America by about 0.9% annually. At the same
time, wide variations in growth rate occurred from country to
country in Europe. For instance, during the late 1980s, Albania
had a yearly growth rate close to 1.9% and Spain about 0.5%,
while the population of Great Britain did not change apprecia-
bly, and that of Germany declined slightly (particularly in the
former East Germany). The overall slow rate of population
increase in the latter half of the 20th century has been the result
primarily of a low birth rate.

intracontinental, especially among members of the European
Union, but Europeans also engage in large-scale trade with
nations of other continents. Germany, France, Great Britain,
Italy, and The Netherlands are among the world’s greatest trad-

levels of energy consumption are lower than in North America.
The leading energy sources are coal, lignite, petroleum, natur-

France, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, and Spain all have major
hydroelectric installations, which contribute much of the annu-

Although coal mining is declining in Europe, it remains impor-

in northern Sweden, eastern France, and Ukraine. A wide range
of other minerals—such as bauxite, copper, manganese, nick-

well as in the southern part of European Russia (notably the

densest in the central part of the continent; Fennoscandia, the
former Soviet Union, and southern Europe have fewer trans-
port facilities in relation to their land area. Europeans own
large numbers of private cars, and much freight is transported
by road. Rail networks are well maintained in most European
countries and are important carriers of passengers as well as
freight. High-speed train networks in France, Italy, and
Germany make use of the most advanced technology. Water
transport also plays a major role in the European economy.

activities. To the east, crops become more important. In the
nations of the Balkan peninsula, crops account for 60% of agri-
cultural production; in Ukraine, wheat production overshad-

noted for its great output of wheat, barley, oats, rye, corn, pota-

eastern Europe face major economic difficulties related to the
rapid transition from the planned economies that prevailed into
the early 1990s to the free-market economies of today; the
Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary have been most suc-

republics of the former Yugoslavia and Albania remain in polit-
ical turmoil, which has severely damaged the national
economies of these countries. The emerging republics of the
former Soviet Union—such as the Baltic states, Ukraine,
Belarus, and the Russian Federation—are experiencing eco-

Switzerland and Luxemburg to less than US$1,000 per annum

have a high level of supranational organization—with institu-

Development (OECD), the European Free Trade Association,
and the European Union (EU). With the recent fall of commu-

"months), Indeed, in recent years, there has been increasing
interest in the relative strengths of these systems, as well as their
persistence. This is exemplified particularly by the North
Atlantic Oscillation index (e.g., Hurrell and van Loon, 1997),
which is a measure of the strength of atmospheric flows over
the North Atlantic and their links to temperature and precipita-
tion patterns over Europe. The prevailing westerly winds,
warmed in part by their passage over the North Atlantic ocean
currents (the Gulf Stream), bring precipitation throughout most
of the year. The strength of these winds varies, partly in
response to the North Atlantic Oscillation. In the Mediterranean
area (i.e., Spain, southern France, Italy, southern Croatia,
Montenegro, Macedonia, Albania, and Greece), the summer
months usually are hot and dry; almost all rainfall in this area
occurs in the winter. From central Poland eastward, the moder-
ating effects of the seas are reduced; consequently, drier condi-
tions prevail, accompanied by a greater amplitude of annual
variation of temperatures (i.e., hot summers and cold winters).
Northwestern Europe is characterized by relatively mild win-
ters, with abundant precipitation along the Scottish and
Norwegian coasts and mountains, and much colder winters and
generally drier conditions in Sweden and Finland. In mountain
regions such as the Alps, winters generally are cool, and snow
remains on the ground for several months of the year; summers
typically are cool and moist. The mountains intercept precipita-
tion driven by frontal systems and can trigger convective rain-
fall (summer thunderstorms) in the absence of major synoptic
disturbances.

"Annual precipitation trends in this century are characterized
essentially by enhanced precipitation in the nothern half of
Europe (i.¢., north of the Alps to northern Fennoscandia), with
increases ranging from 10% to close to 50%. The region
stretching from the Mediterranean through central Europe into
European Russia and Ukraine, by contrast, has experienced
decreases in precipitation by as much as 20% in some areas
(see Figure A-1). In time-series analyses of precipitation aver-
aged over the European region (see Figure A-7), it is difficult
to determine a meaningful trend in precipitation, especially
since the 1950s. The interannual variability seems to have
decreased in the latter part of the record: The amplitude of
departures in precipitation from long-term averages is far less

the winter period (see Figure 5-2); much evidence suggests
that minimum temperature increases have been far larger

al., 1994; Brazdil et al., 1996). In other words, the diurnal
temperature range is decreasing, which is consistent with
evidence from other regions of the world (e.g., Karl et al.,

emphasizes greater warming (2°C per century) in the south-
western part of Europe (Iberian Peninsula, south and central
France) than in the British Isles or along the Baltic coastline

continuous throughout the century; at most stations, an
increase to about 1940 was observed, followed by a leveling
off or even a decrease until about 1970, and then a renewed
warming to the present period. These features are most pro-
nounced in middle to high latitudes. Some locations in
southern Europe exhibit different trends—such as in Greece
and parts of eastern Europe, where some stations show a
cooling trend over much of the century (see Figure A-2 in

warming over most of Europe has been exceptionally great,
with increases in yearly means of 0.25-0.5°C with respect to

important European crops except maize (Semenov et al., 1996;

using isolated plants with optimum nutrient supply. Such
experimental conditions are relevant to horticultural and agro-

show decreases in the Mediterranean region and in central and
eastern Europe, though others show increases; in northern
Europe, most models suggest an increase in summer precipita-

future precipitation trends in parts of Europe, compared with

"GCM projections, though undergoing continuous improve-

draw more than very tentative conclusions. Nested regional cli-
mate model (RCM) simulations also are too tenuous to provide
firm conclusions about climatic change in Europe.
Temperature changes in large parts of Europe will be a function
not only of positive radiative forcing resulting from increases
in the atmospheric concentrations of a number of greenhouse
gases but also of the countereffects of aerosols. Although the
magnitude of the aerosol effects is still quite uncertain, the
regional negative forcing of sulfate aerosols in central Europe
could offset almost half the positive radiative forcing of CO,
(Mitchell et al., 1995). The summary of results that follows is
based on GCM simulations without aerosol forcing that were

ence of precipitation on soil moisture regimes. Indirect effects
also may occur as a result of the responses of herbivores and
pests to climate changes, changes in soil fauna, and changes in
the frequency and severity of disturbances such as fire. In addi-
tion, vegetation responds directly and indirectly to atmospher-
ic CO, concentrations. The responses are species-dependent;
no two taxa respond to climatic change in exactly the same
way (e.g., Stirling et al., 1997). The main response of individ-
ual taxa to climatic change consists of changes in distribution;
adaptive evolutionary changes are very rare (Huntley, 1991).
At the ecosystem level, the impact of CO, on ecosystem
processes remains very uncertain. Zaller and Arnone (1997)

"In a warmer climate, the pattern of species response will be
extremely complex within Europe (Grime, 1996) because a vari-
ety of temperature and moisture gradients exist. Although there
is a general temperature gradient from south to north and from
low to high altitudes, east-west gradients in temperature and pre-
cipitation also exist; the latter are associated with increasing con-
tinentality toward central Europe. Further complications arise in
the prediction of species responses to temperature changes
because of the importance of the nature of the change. For exam-
ple, a rise in late-summer temperatures will have different
impacts than a rise in early-spring temperatures or an average
rise in temperatures spread evenly throughout the year (Fitter et
al., 1995). Similarly, the occurrence of late frost may play an
important role in restricting the responsiveness of small-genome
species to mean temperature changes (MacGillivray and Grime,
1995). This factor makes the prediction of species responses dif-
ficult; a general northward shift in species distributions is now
recognized as too simplistic a hypothesis. Successful migration
depends on a number of factors—in particular, the range of tol-
erance of a given plant or tree to heat and moisture stress, envi-
ronmental conditions at the new location, the rate of migration,
the presence of competing species, and natural and human barri-
ers to migration (Thompson, 1994; Malanson and Cairns, 1997).
Anthropogenic barriers are especially important for large por-

adaptable to climate change. The evidence to support this
hypothesis, however, is very limited (see, e.g., Fries et al.,

studies around natural sources of CO, have not revealed any

"Many changes in forests may occur as a consequence of subtle
alterations in the competitive balance between species. For
example, rising temperatures are likely to change the time
interval between budburst and leaf fall, but the effects will dif-
fer among species. Kramer (1995) argues that the duration of
the growing season is likely to decrease with increasing tem-
perature for European larch (Larix decidua Miller) and pedun-
culate oak (Quercus robur L.), whereas it will increase for
beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and small-leaved lime (Tilia corda-
ta Miller). There already is some evidence that a substantial
(25-30%) proportion of the forests in Switzerland is poorly
adapted to the expected natural species distribution under cur-
rent climatic conditions—and that this proportion will increase
with an increase in temperature (Kienast et al., 1996). Similar
patterns are likely elsewhere in Europe.

"In mountain regions, certain species and communities could
disappear altogether because the upward displacement of
species living close to the upper reaches of mountains will be
constrained by the lack of any place in which they can become
established (Kienast, 1991; Kienast et al., 1996). Modeling
studies in Switzerland (Krauchi and Kienast, 1993) suggest
that a temperature increase of 3°C would result in deciduous
broad-leaved trees invading the subalpine belt and coniferous
trees invading the alpine zone. Within the deciduous zone,
colline Carpinion forests would expand at the expense of sub-
montane and low-montane beech forests (Brzeziecki et al.,
1995). The species composition of future forests would
depend on changes in the continentality of each site. Such
results have not yet been confirmed by empirical studies.
Hattenschwiler and K6rner (1995) found no indication of an
upward movement in Scotch pine in the Swiss central Alps in
response to summer temperatures during the period
1982-1991—when temperatures were, on average, 0.8°C
warmer than those of the period 30 years before. They argued
that the primary control on the altitudinal distribution of
Scotch pine and Arolla pine (Pinus cembra L.) was more like-
ly to be interspecific competition than temperature. However,
some studies (e.g., Hofer, 1992; Grabherr et al., 1994) have
noted an upward shift in the distribution of some alpine

"Increased climatic stress is likely to result in increased amounts
of dead plant material within forests. At the same time, poten-
tial increased carbon-to-nitrogen ratios as a result of increased
CO, may reduce decomposition rates; this effect remains
uncertain, however: Some studies suggest no change (e.g.,
Norby et al., 1995), whereas increased temperatures are likely
to increase decomposition rates in areas such as northern
Scandinavia (Johansson, 1994; Johansson et al., 1995). The net
effect of these different trends is largely unknown. Increased
volumes of dead organic matter, combined with drier climatic
conditions, would increase the fire hazard in many forests. The
Mediterranean zone is likely to be particularly affected, but
other areas also are likely to see an increase in the fire hazard.
Boreal forests, which currently are mainly temperature-limited,
could become soil moisture-limited if warmer temperatures in
spring and summer lead to earlier melting of snowpack and
drying of soil in summer. This shift would lead to increased
risk of biomass loss through drought-driven mortality and fire.
Reduced winter snowpacks also may increase the risk of win-
ter damage to trees during periods when air temperatures are
above zero and the ground remains frozen. Cold winters in
boreal zones and some temperate regions have protected
forests from many of the insects and fungi that are common
further south; a warmer climate is likely to change this situa-
tion (Cammell and Knight, 1992; Straw, 1995).

Norway spruce was predicted to decrease in the south but to

Changes in individual species will depend on the nature of the
climate change in a given area. Because the ranges of many
species are determined primarily by soil moisture patterns,
changes in the absolute amounts of precipitation and the sea-
sonal distributions of precipitation will be important in deter-
mining vegetation responses. Some grassland species also may
respond to increasing CO, concentrations—with the greatest
responses among species characteristic of productive, undis-
turbed habitats and the lowest responses among species adapt-
ed to high environmental stress or rates of physical disturbance
(Hunt et al., 1991, 1993). Experiments with alpine grassland

enhanced nitrogen supply; increases in CO, concentrations

"The climatic changes that have been modeled are likely to have
considerable direct and indirect impacts on plantation forests in
Europe. Proe et al. (1996) have suggested, on the basis of an
ecophysiological process model, that the general yield class
(GYC) of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong) Carriére) in
Scotland would increase by 2.8 m3/ha/yr for each 1°C rise in
temperature. This estimate was based on a uniform increase in
temperature throughout the year. If there were greater warming
during winter months, the GYC increase was 2.4 m3/ha/yr. The
reduction is attributable to the negative correlation between
winter temperature and growth rate in this species, which is
believed to be caused by the increased activities of pests in
warmer winters and the winter chilling requirements of the
species. Similar negative relationships between GYC and win-
ter temperature have been identified in Scotland for Douglas fir
(Pseudotsuga menziesii F. Mirb.) and Scotch pine (Pinus
sylvestris L.), but not for Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi (L.)
Carriére) (Tyler et al., 1996). The winter chilling requirement
seems to be a major factor in determining the distribution of
many tree species (Sykes et al., 1996).

"The interactions between a general increase in winter tempera-
ture and the occurrence of frost damage have been studied in
detail. The timing of budburst is triggered by temperature; it is
a function of the chilling requirement and the critical tempera-
ture sum (although precipitation, photoperiod, CO, concentra-
tion, and the nutritional status of the tree also may play roles).
There are differences in the timing of budburst between species,
between genotypes, and between phenotypes. Consequently,
some models have predicted an increase in frost injury, such as
in central and northern Finland (Bach, 1987; Kellomaki et al.,
1995), whereas others—such as that developed by Kramer
(1994) for The Netherlands and Germany—suggest less injury.
In Britain, Murray et al. (1989) have suggested that there may
be no change in frost injury at lowland sites and an increase at
upland sites for some species. There is likely to be considerable
flexibility in budburst within a given population, providing
some capacity for adaptation to climate change (Beuker, 1994).
Because increased CO, concentrations may delay budburst,
there appears to be an antagonistic effect between rising CO,
concentrations and temperatures that may reduce the increase in
frost risk for some species in some areas (Murray et al., 1994).

As a result, hydrology and landscape patterns will be affected,

"Temperature increases in spring and summer will accelerate
the course of crop development more crucially on short-cycle
crops that are sown in spring than on winter crops. This gener-
al rule must be adapted, however, to local conditions (see, e.g.,
Saarikko and Carter, 1996)—who show by simulation that the
sowing-to-leading phase in spring cereals in Finland declines
by about 1 day per 1°C warming, and the heading-to-yellow
ripening shortens by 24 days per 1°C warming). A simulation
exercise on sunflowers shows a reduction of the crop cycle by
10-50 days with UKTR3140 scenario and 10-70 days with
UKTR6675 (see Harrison and Butterfield, 1996 for extensive
results on sunflower development under different GCM-based
scenarios). This quite important change is likely to affect most
of Europe, with a gradient from the southwest (low reduction
in Spain and Italy, where cycles are already short) to the north-
east (Poland and Russia). This pattern can be extrapolated to all
determinate summer crops. Nondeterminate crops would expe-
rience a faster rate of development as well, which would
induce earlier senescence.

"For summer crops, determinate crop yields would be affected
by the shortened crop cycle and reduced time to assimilate sup-
ply and grain-filling periods. On the other hand, improvements
in the rate of dry-matter production can be expected from
enhanced CO, concentrations. This effect has been illustrated
for sunflowers (CLAIRE, 1996), where simulation models sug-
gest a compensation between the negative effects of tempera-
ture and the positive effects of carbon fertilization. Under the
IS92a emission scenario, yield benefits occur in central and
eastern Europe and losses occur in western Europe—but all of
them are small. With 1S92d emissions, the gains are even
smaller, but the losses are amplified (see Table 5-3). The same
pattern can be expected for all determinate summer crops (even
if the fertilizing effect of atmospheric CO} is less beneficial to
C, crops such as maize). Similar results were obtained with
onion, whose simulated yield increased 4-8% with UKTR3140
and GFDL2534 (IS92a emissions) and 15% (resp. 7%) with
UKTR6675 and GFDL5564, IS92a (resp. IS92c)—CO, effects
again counteracting a negative effect of reduced growth period
on yield (see CLAIRE, 1996). For nondeterminate crops, Peiris
et al. (1996) expect potato yields to increase by as much as
35% under northern conditions as a result of the lengthening of
the growing season, regardless of CO, fertilization effects.

"Higher temperatures in summer should not be a real challenge
to summer crops (except spring cereals, if subjected to elevat-
ed temperatures during the grain-filling period) because they
are more resilient than winter crops. Drought could be a major
concern in the future, however, particularly in the
Mediterranean zone and in central Europe. This is a genuinely
complex problem; GCM-based scenarios do not agree on the
magnitude of changes in space of at least one component of the
water budget (precipitation), and changes in another compo-
nent—potential evapotranspiration (PET)—are extremely
dependent on calculation methods. Le Houérou (1995) states
that a 1°C increase in air temperature will induce 37 mm more
PET south of 40°N (ECRASE, 1996)—an enormous 60%
increase in PET in southern European countries. If simulated
changes of -10% to -20% in summer precipitation for western,
southern, and central Europe are reliable, fully irrigated crops
may become even larger competitors to domestic and industri-
al users for water resources stored in aquifers and rivers (a 20%
reduction represents a significant loss in currently moist areas).

early (fall, spring) disease outbursts for annual and perennial

1994). Sophisticated agricultural systems probably can cope
with increasing weeds, pests, and diseases in a sustainable
manner (better-targeted and more efficient chemicals, risk
forecast models, adapted machinery, etc.). The global result
will depend on how widespread such agriculture will be in
Europe around 2050. Whether controls will be possible in
autumn and spring (i.e., whether working days will be avail-
able) also is questionable and must be studied in more detail.
(Some model results are available for Finland.) The risk of
crop damage from pests and diseases increases in all regions
under a warming of climate. Northward shifts in the distribu-
tion of certain pests could be of similar magnitudes and rates
as those estimated for cereal crops. Additional generations of
multivariate species also can be expected. The damage poten-
tial of diseases such as potato late blight could increase at a
similar rate as the potential increase in yields of the crop host.
This analysis implies an increased requirement for pest and

during the summer may decrease the growth capabilities of
grass. Higher CO, tends to abate the negative effects of tem-
perature, as demonstrated experimentally by Soussana et al.
(1994). The interaction between nitrogen level and carbon dis-
tribution in crops nevertheless is a key factor in forecasting the
responses of grasses (Casella et al., 1996). Some recent years
in Europe have illustrated the immediate impact of dry periods
on grassland production because of low rooting depth, shallow
soils, etc., leading to a reduction in yield. Similar events may
become more common in the future. Through simulation
experiments, Rounsevell et al. (1996) show that grassland pro-
duction in England and Wales is resilient to small increases in
temperature and precipitation—and even stimulated at higher
elevations. Experiments in northern and western Europe have
shown positive responses in total biomass production across a
range of grass species to increased temperature (+3°C) and ele-
vated CO, concentrations (Jones et al., 1996; Jones et al.,
1997). The interactive response may be less than additive,
however, indicating a decline in response to elevated CO, as
temperature increases. A significant part of the temperature
response is manifest through an extended growing period. The
response of below-ground growth to elevated CO, appears to
be greater than that of above-ground growth, and there are dif-

although agricultural production in Spain decreased in 1994
(-4.3%) as a result of the drought conditions, the Spanish agrar-

higher temperatures lead to higher potential evaporation and
decreased discharge (which also is a function of precipitation,
storage, and topography). The storage of water in the soil
serves as a buffer; in winter and spring, increasing precipitation
normally generates higher discharge because the buffer is full
and evaporation is low. During the summer, storage is reduced
by evapotranspiration and must be refilled before discharge
begins. Changes in the hydrological cycle therefore are more
variable than changes in other climatic factors. Seasonal-to-
interannual variability in precipitation and temperature also
accounts for some of the variability in hydrological character-

phere in the Alps and the Fennoscandian mountains would
have significant consequences for the flow regimes of rivers
originating in these mountains. Changes in hydrological
regimes would particularly affect populations living down-
stream of the mountains that depend on the water the moun-
tains provide for freshwater supply, industrial and energy
usage, irrigation, and, in some cases, transportation—as on the
Rhine and the Danube, both of which are particularly sensitive
to flow changes. As the extensive flooding in Poland,
Germany, and the Czech Republic in 1997 has demonstrated,
many flood defense systems have a limited capacity, and any
changes in hydrological regimes could have major impacts in
floodplain areas.

"In terms of water management, system yields of river basins are
likely to decrease as a result of changes in flow patterns; these

floods and droughts. There may be a potential for conflict over

river basins that are shared by several countries. The high pop-

"Another unknown factor is the effect of increased plant water-
use efficiency (WUE) resulting from increased CO in the
atmosphere. Under laboratory and greenhouse conditions,
plants seem to use less water for constant yield or exhibit high-
er productivity. In the field, however, predictions of WUE at
the catchment or even ecosystem level are not yet feasible. In
water-limited systems (e.g., in the Mediterranean region), a
higher WUE can increase or maintain productivity—whereas
in the humid areas of northern Europe, it could theoretically
decrease evaporation and therefore increase discharge.
"	Text
"Another consequence of increasing temperatures is a change in
the distribution of water in the landscape. Especially in flat
regions (e.g., lowlands in The Netherlands and northern
Germany), catchment areas depend on groundwater recharge.
Changes in percolation therefore can change the size of catch-
ments (Hoermann et al., 1995). On a local catchment scale,
distribution of water in the landscape can change even if annu-
al discharge remains unchanged: Whereas hilltops are severely
stressed by drought, areas with high groundwater levels may
remain largely unaffected.

"The effects on different regions of Europe can be classified
according to the climatic gradients from north to south and
from west to east (the maritime-to-continental gradient).
According to current and projected distributions of rainfall,
there may be an increase in summer drought. Observed precip-
itation shows a decrease in summer and an increase in winter
and spring. Such a change is likely to affect mainly areas that
already are sensitive to drought: the southern and continental
parts of Europe, especially the Mediterranean region.
Additional consumption of water for irrigation may create
additional depletion of water reservoirs and groundwater.

"GCM-based analyses for the European continent (IPCC 1996,
WG II, Table 10-1) give a range of possible responses of river
runoff in a warmer global climate—from decreases in some
regions (e.g., Hungary, Greece) to increases in other regions
(United Kingdom, Finland, Ukraine); these estimates are a
function of precipitation, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture
projections in the different GCMs. The uncertainties of climate
model results, however, remain very large in terms of hydro-
logical forecasting, particularly at the regional scale. This lim-
itation is particularly critical for water management practices
in the future because water resource impacts occur at the local
scale, not at regional or larger scales.

"The river basin is the natural spatial unit for water resource
management; because neighboring river basins can have quite
different climate change impacts, making quantitative state-

is difficult given that many regions include a wide range of
hydroclimatic regions. The results of catchment-scale simula-
tions with conventional hydrological models driven by GCM
data therefore are highly variable. Arnell and Reynard (1996),
for example, simulated changes of 20% in annual runoff for
21 catchments in Great Britain—with a tendency toward lower
amounts of discharge, especially in sensitive areas and during
the summer months.

"Warmer average and extreme temperatures will enhance the
demand for freshwater, particularly for agriculture and direct
human consumption, although the water-quality requirements
are different for these two types of consumption. Changes in
precipitation patterns, particularly over regions that already are
sensitive (e.g., the Mediterranean basin), may lead to increased
demand for water for irrigation purposes, especially for soils
with low water-storage capacities. If precipitation were to
undergo a decline in the Mediterranean basin (which is not
always the case suggested by GCM simulations), countries such
as Spain, Italy, and Greece would face substantially increased
tisks of summer water shortages. In such a situation, increases
in storage capacity would be needed to maintain existing water
and energy supplies. The Netherlands could face the desiccation
of most of its wetland areas or be forced increasingly to rely on
the Rhine to maintain present water levels. Groundwater
aquifers could be affected by increased saltwater intrusion as
sea level rises. Given a possible 4°C temperature increase and a
rise in the Alpine snow line of 500-700 m in the summer, the
flow of the Rhine could decline by 10% during this season. A
temperature increase of only 0.5°C and a daily rainfall decrease
of a few percent would decrease runoff in Hungary by 25-30%.
Despite projected wetter winters, drier summers and increased
evaporation in southeastern England may reduce yields in
impounding reservoirs by 8-15%. Aquifer yields, which are
very important to the London area, may fall by 8%. Supplies of
water during warmer, possibly drier, summers would need to be
maintained through larger storage or transfers from wetter
regions. Water quality may deteriorate because there would be
less river flow to dilute contaminants.

This increase is two to five times the rate experienced over the

sarily be the same as the global average because of vertical
land movements (glacial isostatic rebound, tectonic activity,
subsidence) and possible changes in ocean water characteris-

water density). Other climatic change in Europe is uncertain.
An increase in precipitation intensity seems likely, increasing
the flood risk in low-lying coastal areas.

"Without adaptation, a rise in sea level would inundate and dis-
place wetlands and lowlands, erode shorelines, exacerbate
coastal storm flooding, increase the salinity of estuaries, threat-

The impacts would vary from place to place and would depend
on coastal type and relative topography. Areas most at risk
would be tidal deltas, low-lying coastal plains, beaches, islands
(including barrier islands), coastal wetlands, and estuaries.
Tidal range also is a key factor: In general, the smaller the tidal
range, the greater the response to a given rise in sea level. This
pattern suggests that the Mediterranean and Baltic coasts, with
their low tidal range, may be more vulnerable to sea-level rise
than the open ocean coasts.

"Examples of susceptible coasts include the Rhone, Po, and
Ebro deltas (Jimenez and Sanchez-Arcilla, 1997; Sanchez-

because of natural and sometimes human factors, and they are
sediment-starved as a result of changes in catchment manage-
ment. For example, the Ebro delta has lost 97% of its sand sup-
ply since the 1950s. Reduction or loss of these areas would
impact important agricultural and natural values. Many of
Europe’s largest cities—such as London, Hamburg, St.
Petersburg, Thessaloniki, and Venice—are built on estuaries
and lagoons (Frasetto, 1991). Such locations are exposed to
storm surges, and climatic change is an important factor to con-
sider for long-term development. In Venice, a 30-cm rise in rel-
ative sea level this century has greatly exacerbated flooding
and damage to this unique medieval city; permanent solutions
to this problem are still being investigated. Beaches tend to
erode given sea-level rise, which destroys a valuable resource
and exposes human activities landward of the beach to
increased wave and flood action. Intense recreational use of
beaches in many coastal areas, particularly around the
Mediterranean, makes this erosion a particular problem; some
response to such changes often is essential. In higher latitudes,
gravel beaches are more common than sand beaches (Carter

would increase the population living below the 1,000-year

However, other coastal settings often are not being managed

"Analysts often employ simplifying assumptions regarding
response strategies. The costs in Table 5-4, for example,
assume that all densely populated areas will be protected. An
alternative assumption is that the costs of protection (includ-

costs of land loss. Fankhauser (1994) analyzed this assump-
tion for countries in the OECD. He concludes that it is optimal
to protect all harbors and cities. Open coasts and beaches need
to be maintained and protected in densely populated areas
(such as The Netherlands) and in areas where beach tourism is
important (such as Greece, Italy, and Spain). On the other
hand, areas with low population density (such as Norway and
Iceland) and poorer areas (such as Turkey) have a lower opti-
mal level of protection. Turner et al. (1995) analyzed protec-
tion in East Anglia, England. At the regional scale, protection
can be justified for the entire coast. When the 113 individual
flood compartments were evaluated, however, the study indi-
cated that it may not be economically justifiable to continue to
protect 20% of compartments, even with modest rates of sea-
level rise. This analysis assumes that there is no interaction
between flood compartments—which may not always be the
case. However, it suggests that a range of responses, rather
than a single response, may be appropriate at regional and
national scales.

Britain, some managed setback schemes have been carried out
on a pilot basis. In these areas—which had previously been
reclaimed for agriculture—the sea defense has been realigned
and the seawall breached to recreate areas of salt marsh and

restoration of natural balance in estuaries and to provide flood

increases in flood magnitudes and frequencies are unlikely to

only through the impact of land subsidence on buildings.
Damage to buildings from windstorms is widely covered by
insurance in Europe. Dorland ef al. (1996) show that an increase
of a few percent in storm intensity (not inconsistent with GCM
results) could double or triple storm damages, most of which
are insured. This effect occasionally could lead to troubles in
the insurance sector—witness the total insured losses of $10 bil-

until the third quarter of this century, the disease was present in
southern Europe. Although malaria was successfully eradicat-
ed from most of Europe during the 1950s and 1960s, there have
been recurrent outbreaks in Turkey and the former Soviet
Union (Bruce-Chwatt and de Zulueta, 1980), and it is present
in parts of North Africa. Different types of malaria are present;
the severity of symptoms is related to the plasmodia involved.
The most dangerous form is Plasmodium falciparum (other
species are P. vivax, P ovalum, and P. malariae). Climate
change would increase the risk of malaria transmission (which
currently is low). However, existing public-health resources—

"No European-equivalent estimates of additional heat-related
deaths attributable to climate change, based on local empiri-
cal studies, are yet available. A clear rise in daily mortality
was associated with the 1995 extreme heat wave in the United
Kingdom; the increase was approximately twice as great
within the urban London population (Rooney et al., 1997).
By simple extrapolation from a U.S. study, Fankhauser
(1995) concluded that about 9,600 additional heat-related
deaths per year may occur in the European Union for a 2.5°C
temperature rise, and about 8,400 additional deaths may
occur in the former Soviet Union. In both cases, full physio-
logical acclimatization is assumed; population size, air con-
ditioning, and medical care are assumed to be unchanged
from present conditions.

"2) Changes in seasonal and daily temperatures and humidity
are likely to affect the concentration of airborne materials that
impinge on respiratory health. The production of photochemi-
cal smog proceeds more rapidly at higher temperatures. The
concentrations and onset and duration of season of allergenic
pollens and spores are related to cumulative temperatures and
rainfall, though in a complex manner (Emberlin, 1994;
Spieksma et al., 1995). Alterations in the concentration of
aeroallergens may affect the seasonality of certain allergic res-
piratory disorders. Relatively little research has been done on
these processes and relationships within Europe or elsewhere,
however. Interactive adverse effects on mortality have been
reported from Athens in response to simultaneous high tem-
peratures and high levels of air pollution (Katsouyanni et al.,
1993).

"1) An increased frequency or severity of heat waves would
cause an increase in heat-related mortality and illness. In con-
trast, less-severe cold weather would reduce the documented
seasonal excess of deaths in winter. Many studies have shown
that instances of heat hyperpyrexia and overall death rates rise
during heat waves, particularly when the temperature rises
above the local population’s physiological threshold and the
temperature increases are accompanied by high humidity.
Several U.S. studies indicate that, on average, approximately
one-third of these deaths would occur 2-3 weeks after the heat
wave in susceptible persons, whereas other deaths apparently
are unexpected. By applying these documented heat wave-
associated risks to transient climate change scenarios associat-
ed with CO,-doubling, U.S. researchers have estimated that the
number of heat-related deaths may increase several-fold in
very large U.S. cities by 2050 (Kalkstein, 1993). In such cities,
this would represent up to several thousand additional deaths
per year.
"	Text
"This heat-related increase in deaths would be partially offset by
reductions in cold-related deaths (predominantly cardiovascu-
lar). A recent study (Martens, 1997) estimated that in areas
with temperate and cold climates—which includes large parts
of the European continent—a globally averaged temperature
increase of approximately 1°C could result in a reduction in
winter cardiovascular mortality, especially in older people.
Another British study (Langford and Bentham, 1995) has fore-
cast that approximately 9,000 fewer winter-related deaths
would occur annually by the year 2050 in England and Wales
under a 2-2.5°C increase in average winter temperature. On
the other hand, Fankhauser (1995) arrives (again by extrapola-
tion from the United States) at about 800 fewer winter deaths
for the entire EU. The EUROWINTER group (1997) assessed
increases in mortality per 1°C decrease in temperature in vari-
ous European regions. This study shows that mortality
increased to a greater extent with a given decline in tempera-
ture in regions with warm winters, in populations with cooler
homes, and among people who wore fewer clothers and were
less active outdoors. Apparently there still is insufficient

the sand fly vectors. Higher temperatures also would acceler-

Localized outbreaks of “airport malaria” may occur (because
of increases in tourism, increased malaria in countries that
Europeans visit, and warmer local conditions in Europe), so it
is important to strengthen current policies. For example, about
2,000 cases of malaria were diagnosed in England in 1990, and
there are 10-12 fatalities each year. A troublesome trend is the
increasing resistance of the plasmodia to prophylactics, which
increases the chances of disease transmission.

"Several existing tick-borne infectious diseases are significant in
Europe (e.g., Lyme disease, which is caused by the bacterium
Borrelia burgdorferi, and tick-borne viral encephalitis). The
tick’s life cycle is sensitive to temperature and humidity, and
tick populations depend on access to intermediate host animal
species (especially rodents and deer). Unpublished data indicate
that an earlier onset of spring and a later arrival of the winter
season are related to increases in the incidence of tick-borne
encephalitis in Sweden (Lindgren and Gustafson, submitted).

"In the foregoing sections, impact categories have been treated
separately. Obviously, however, the impacts of climate change
interact with one another—through the use of resources such as
water and land and through economy, society, and politics. An
integrated assessment tries to take these interactions into
account. In addition, an integrated assessment tries to compare
the diversity of impacts with respect to their seriousness (from
a human viewpoint) and evaluate overall vulnerability to cli-
mate change.

"The actual impact of climate change on human health is mod-
ulated by the susceptibility of the exposed population and the
human ability to adapt. In general, the most vulnerable popula-
tions, communities, or subgroups would be people living in
poverty or with a high prevalence of malnutrition, chronic
exposure to infectious disease agents, and inadequate access to
social and physical infrastructures. Within Europe, in general,
the vulnerability to many health impacts is limited by existing
material resources, public health measures, and systems of
health care. Heat waves, other forms of extreme weather, air-
borne respiratory hazards, and vector-borne infectious diseases
may have an impact, however.

"5) Increases in non-vector-borne infectious diseases also would
occur because of the effect of higher temperatures on microor-
ganism proliferation. Many food-related infections are affected
by ambient temperatures and have their annual peaks during
the summer months (e.g., food poisoning from salmonellosis)
(Bentham and Langford, 1995). Declining water availability
and quality also would pose risks to health. Flooding and
tegional droughts would alter the mix of drinking water
sources in some locations. Outbreaks of waterborne infectious
diseases such as cryptosporidiosis—which have occurred in
both the United Kingdom and the United States in recent
years—may become more likely.

aegypti in its importance as a disease vector of dengue and
dengue hemorrhagic fever. The first sighting of the vector
species in Europe (in 1979) came from Albania. However, it
was only when Ae. albopictus was introduced into Italy in
1990—through the importation of used tires—and subsequent-
ly spread that the species was considered a threat to public
health. By the end of 1995, Ae. albopictus infestations had
been reported in 10 Italian regions and 19 provinces. Other
countries where climatic conditions meet such criteria and that
may be vulnerable to a potential introduction of Ae. albopictus
include Spain, Portugal, Greece, Turkey, France, Albania, and
the former Republic of Yugoslavia (Knudsen et al., 1996).

values fall significantly. This result would create problems for water availability, water quality, and aquatic ecosystems.

"The observed climate of 1937-1992 served as a reference scenario. Six additional scenarios were developed to capture
possible changes in climate under various assumptions about the frequency, length, and type of anomalous weather con-
ditions. A synthetic year was composed from a warm and wet spring, a hot and dry summer, a warm and wet fall, and a
warm and wet winter. The frequency of these extreme years was increased by 20% in Scenario 2; Scenario 3 contained
the same extreme year only. Scenarios 4 and 6 were created by modifying the frequency of extreme conditions by 20%
in monthly patterns and summer weather conditions, respectively. Scenarios 5 and 7 contained only synthetic years

derived from modified monthly and summer patterns, respectively.

"An integrated assessment model combines climate change sce-
narios with models of various impacts of climate change in a
single computer code (i.e., hard-linking of models). One advan-
tage of this approach is that consistency is ensured (e.g., land or
water used for agriculture is not used in the domestic sector). A
disadvantage is that modeling and computational requirements
entail simplifications of the state-of-the-art. Only two integrated
assessment models are even somewhat useful for climate change
impact assessment in Europe; the other twenty-odd models
reviewed in IPCC (1996, WG III, Chapter 10) have other aims
or are based on monetization. The first integrated assessment

dominant vegetation form as a consequence of increasing dryness; it is uncertain, however, that dryness will increase. On
the other hand, two local forest succession models show that the simulated potential natural vegetation of beech will be
replaced almost everywhere by mixed stands of oak, lime, and fir. Currently, forestry in Brandenburg relies mainly on fir
stands; simulation results show that there is little chance for improved conditions at current sites even under optimistic
projections of climates. Reduced water availability would result in substantially reduced yields. Unfavorable secondary
impacts—such as more frequent forest fires and increased pest and insect damages—together with higher management
costs and timber loss are likely to generate significant economic losses.

is, human preferences are expressed by people’s willingness

are well established and widely applied. Numerous theoreti-
cal and empirical problems remain, however. Based on the
SAR (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 6), Fankhauser and Tol

from a doubling of atmospheric concentrations of carbon
dioxide of about -1.6% to -1.4% of the GDP in western
Europe, using a mix of earlier GCM scenarios standardized

between -0.4% and +0.4% (a benefit) of GDP. These figures
compare with an estimated world impact of -1.8% to -1.2%

average, but only one country-specific study has been car-

"Changes in agricultural yield were simulated for wheat, corn, rape, grassland, and beans. Because of the light soils in the

An earlier seed time and the use of other varieties of corn has almost no effect on yields. Because the agriculture of the
region is dominated by dairy production, food for cattle has the highest priority. To minimize the risk of bad harvests,
farmers should irrigate or replace corn with grassland, which uses winter rainfall more efficiently.

"All results are based on a climate data set of 60 years with a maximum increase of 2.7°C; rainfall was assumed to be
unchanged. Potential evapotranspiration (pET) would increase by about 100 mm, but actual evapotranspiration (aET)
would differ only slightly from observed values because soil water storage would become a limiting factor. During sum-
mer, there may be considerably more drought stress. Soil moisture repletion in autumn and winter would take consider-
ably longer: The profile would not be filled until January. As a result, farmers would have to change their land use from
spring cereals to winter crops or install irrigation systems on the light soils.

"Under scenario conditions, rivers and lakes will be more severely affected than terrestrial ecosystems. The structure of
the landscape will be more pronounced between dry uphill patches and downhill regions with access to groundwater. The
soil water storage capacity will become much more limiting and will increase the local risk of bad harvests; adaptation of
land-use practices would be necessary. Despite numerous efforts to predict species composition in terrestrial and aquatic
ecosystems, predictions on a local scale are not possible. Changes should be evaluated by a combination of models and
monitoring programs (predictive monitoring).

"Vegetation studies were conducted for primary production of alder, vegetation structure in grassland, soil respiration,
changes in the length of the growth period in beech forest, and production of beech and Carex acutiformis. Zoological
case studies were carried out for molluscs, birds, mice, several invertebrates, and the food chain of the robin. Particularly
interesting is the decrease in the number of long-distance (trans-Sahara) migratory birds—a phenomenon that also has
been observed in other regions of Germany. One possibie explanation could be that with increasing temperatures, the
nests and territories of these birds already have been occupied by nonmigratory birds and birds with short passage that
can respond more quickly to the changing conditions of rising temperatures.

output from one model as input to another), and discussion.
This approach better reflects the full richness of the literature
and the complexity of the issues (including nonmodeled
parts), but it lacks the solid outcome of a model. This
approach has been used for the United Kingdom (CCIRG,
1991, 1996), Finland (SILMU, 1996), the state of
Brandenburg in Germany (see Box 5-2), the Bornhéved lake
district in Germany (see Box 5-3), and land use in England

scenarios, the UK and Finland studies are least ambitious in
integration yet most comprehensive in areas and topics cov-
ered; relevant findings are discussed elsewhere in this chapter.
The Brandenburg and Bornhéved studies consider only small
areas, focusing on the impact of climate change on ecosys-
tems. The study on England and Wales uses world food prices
(from Rosenzweig and Parry, 1994) and climate change sce-

although the aggregate agricultural output of this region is
unlikely to change drastically, the spatial distribution of activ-

ENSO events associated with massive fluctuations in the
marine ecosystems off the coasts of Ecuador, Peru, and north-
ern Chile (which are among the richest fisheries in the world)
would have adverse socioeconomic consequences on fishing
and fishmeal production. Experimental El Nino forecasts have
been applied, with remarkable success, in Peru and Brazil to
reduce economic disruptions in agriculture. Climate variability
also determines important changes in the distribution and inten-

"Latin America’s geographical location and geomorphology
contribute to its large variety of climates, ranging from hyper-
arid desert climates to humid tropical forest climates. The
regional climate distribution is defined by interactions among
the predominant atmospheric circulation patterns and the
region’s topographical features, radiation budgets, and heat and
water balances—which, in turn, depend on the vast range of
soil/vegetation types of the region. The extensive central por-
tion of Latin America is characterized largely by humid, tropi-
cal conditions; important areas (e.g., in Brazil) are subject to
drought, floods, and freezes. Atmospheric circulation and
ocean currents are causal factors of extensive deserts in north-
ern Mexico, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina.

"Latin American forests—which occupy approximately 22% of
the region and represent about 27% of global forest coverage—
have a strong influence on local and regional climate, play a
significant role in the global carbon budget, contain an impor-
tant share of all plant and animal species of the region, and are
economically very important for national and international
markets. Vulnerability studies indicate that forest ecosystems
in many countries (e.g., Mexico, countries of the Central
American isthmus, Venezuela, Brazil, Bolivia) could be affect-
ed by projected climatic changes. Deforestation in the Amazon
rainforest is likely to have a negative impact on the recycling
of precipitation through evapotranspiration. Rainfall would be
markedly reduced, leading to important runoff losses in areas
within and beyond this basin.

"Latin America includes all continental countries of the
Americas from Mexico to Chile and Argentina, as well as adja-
cent seas. The region is highly heterogeneous in terms of cli-
mate, ecosystems, human population distribution, and cultural
traditions. Most Latin American production activities are based
on the region’s extensive natural ecosystems. Land use is a
major force driving ecosystem change at present; it interacts
with climate in complex ways. This complexity makes the task
of identifying common patterns of vulnerability to climate
change very difficult. Major sectors in which the impacts of
climate change could be important are natural ecosystems
(e.g., forests, rangelands, wetlands), water resources, coastal
zones, agriculture, and human health. The relative importance
attributed to each of these projected impacts varies among
countries.

"Changes in climate over the past century have included a rise
in the mean surface temperature, particularly at middle and
high latitudes, and changes in precipitation rates and intensities
in various countries of the region (e.g., southern Brazil,
Paraguay, Argentina). Climate change could modify present
conditions, with beneficial or adverse impacts—as presently
occurs as a result of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
phenomenon. Natural climate variability at the time scale of
seasons to several years has produced significant effects on
Latin American countries, suggesting that climate change pro-
jections become an important element for national and region-
al planning. However, climate change should be considered not
in isolation but in close interaction with other important factors
for development, such as land-use practices and land-use
change, population growth, economic situations, and commu-
nity behavior.

"Studies of vulnerability to sea-level rise have suggested that

"Approximately 35% of the world’s continental water (freshwa-

in and among countries is highly variable. Freshwater systems
(i.e., rivers, lakes, reservoirs, nontidal wetlands) and their
ecosystems are potentially very sensitive to climate change and
vulnerable to short-term fluctuations in climate, such as those
associated with the ENSO phenomenon.

tribution of precipitation; they are only secondarily affected by
other climate variables (with the exception of high-temperature
persistence in wildfire-prone areas). Temperate grasslands are
vulnerable to drought; therefore, livestock production would
drop drastically if precipitation decreased substantially or if
higher temperatures led to increased evapotranspiration rates. An
increased frequency of extreme events is likely to have larger
impacts than changes in mean temperature or precipitation. The
preservation of large-scale range management units and protect-
ed areas may assist migration and recolonization by native
species in response to changing environmental conditions.

"Agricultural lands (excluding pastures) represent approximate-
ly 19% of the land area of Latin America. Over the past 40
years, the contribution of agriculture to the gross domestic
product (GDP) of Latin American countries has been on the
order of 10%. Agriculture remains a key sector in the regional
economy, however, because it occupies an important segment
(30-40%) of the economically active population. It also is very
important for the food security of the poorest sectors of the pop-
ulation. Studies in Brazil, Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay based
on GCMs and crop models project decreased yields of a num-
ber of crops (e.g., barley, grapes, maize, potatoes, soybeans,
wheat)—even when the direct effects of carbon dioxide (CO})
fertilization and the implementation of moderate adaptation
measures at the farm level are considered. Global warming also
could enhance the negative impacts of animal and plant diseases
and pests, with further negative effects on production.

"In the humid tropics, extreme precipitation events would
increase the number of reservoirs silting up well before their
design lives have been reached. Other areas affected by the
impact of climate change on water resources could be those
that rely on freshwater ecosystems (i.e., lakes and inland wet-
lands and their biota), including commercial and subsistence
fisheries. Climate change will interact strongly with anthro-
pogenic changes in land use, waste disposal, and water extrac-
tion; regional water resources will become increasingly
stressed by higher demands to meet the needs of growing pop-
ulations and economies, as well as by temperature increases.
Conflicts may arise among users and regions—and even
among Latin American countries that share common river
basins. The effects of climate change on agricultural demands
for water, particularly for irrigation, will depend significantly
on changes in agricultural potential, prices of agricultural pro-
duce, and water costs.

"Mountain ranges and plateaus play an important role in deter-
mining Latin America’s climate, hydrological cycle, and biodi-
versity. They are source regions of massive rivers (e.g., the trib-
utary rivers of the Amazonas and Orinoco basins) and represent
important foci of biological diversification and endemism—and
they are highly susceptible to extreme events. The cryosphere in
Latin America is represented by glaciers in the high Andes and
three major ice fields in southern South America. Warming in
high mountain regions could lead to the disappearance of sig-
nificant snow and ice surfaces. In addition, changes in atmos-
pheric circulation resulting from the ENSO phenomenon and
climate change could modify snowfall rates—with a direct
effect on the seasonal renewal of water supply—and surface
and underground runoff in piedmont areas. This could affect
mountain sports and tourist activities, which represent an
important source of income in some economies. Glaciers are
melting at an accelerated rate in the Venezuelan and Peruvian
Andes; however, the largest glaciers in the Patagonian Andes
would continue to exist into the 22nd century.

"The vulnerability of Latin American countries to climate
change strongly depends on the impacts of climate change on
water availability, as shown by studies performed under the
auspices of the U.S. Country Studies Program (USCSP) and
the Global Environment Facility (GEF). Changes in precipita-
tion rates have consequences for hydropower production in
Costa Rica, Panama, and western Argentina. ENSO events dur-
ing recent decades have led to a significant reduction in runoff
and consequently to higher dependence on thermal energy pro-
duction, especially in areas with few energy alternatives.
Alterations in hydrological balance resulting from climate
change could reduce already impaired water supply and distri-
bution systems in major Latin American cities and rural areas.
According to vulnerability studies carried out in Mexico and
Peru, the combined impacts of global warming and population
growth could result in major reductions in water availability in
both countries in coming decades. Monitoring of the hydrolog-
ical cycle, sensitivity studies, development planning, and
improved water management practices are key elements in
preparing for projected water shortages.

brings to the coasts of Ecuador, Peru, and Chile large masses of
phytoplankton that originate in the Antarctic Ocean, supporting
one of the world’s richest fisheries. This process is interrupted
by the western displacement of the Humbolt current and the
irruption (advection) of warmer waters caused by the weaken-

"Prominent among SO-related anomalies in South America is
the well-documented tendency for anomalously-wet conditions
along the otherwise arid coast of northern Peru and southern
Ecuador during El Nilo episodes (Rasmuson and Carpenter,
1982). The relationship between the SO and rainfall anomalies
in northeastern Brazil has long been recognized (Walker, 1928;
Doberitz, 1969; Caviedes, 1973; Hastenrath, 1976; Kousky et
al., 1984). Rainfall anomalies related to the SO in extratropical
South America have been documented primarily for central
Chile (Rubin, 1955). A tendency for precipitation in subtropi-
cal Chile to be exceptionally abundant during El Nifo years
has been noted. This relationship is consistent with the signifi-
cant negative correlation between pressure differences (Tahiti
minus Darwin) and annual precipitation in central Chile
(Pittock, 1980) and snow accumulation in the southern Andes
(Cerveny et al., 1987). Rainfall in the Central America-
Caribbean domain also is related to the SO, as revealed by the
tendency for drought conditions to occur during warm episodes
off the Peruvian coast (Hastenrath, 1976).

(Berlage, 1966; Burgos et al., 1991; Santibanez and Uribe,
1994; Vargas and Bishoff, 1995; IPCC 1996, WG I, Chapter 4).
During ENSO years, precipitation in some areas of northern
South America is lower (Aceituno, 1987), increasing the like-
lihood of drought. ENSO events also can lead to higher pre-
cipitation and air temperature, as has occurred in the coastal
deserts of Peru and Chile (Caviedes, 1973). In addition, these
events are related to massive fluctuations in marine ecosystems
of the southern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, with adverse
socioeconomic consequences for commercial fishing and fish-
meal production in Chile, Peru, Brazil, and Argentina (Pauly
and Tsukayama, 1987; Pauly et al., 1987; Pauley et al., 1989;

America and adjacent oceans (Labraga, 1997; Labraga and

layer equilibrium experiments ranged between 1.5°C and
4.0°C at the time of CO, doubling; transient experiments with
coupled GCMs simulated mean temperature increases of
1.2-1.7°C. According to the results of five coupled GCMs,
temperatures in the semi-arid zone of central Chile and central-
western Argentina during the Southern Hemisphere summer
are simulated to increase by 1-3°C at the time of CO, dou-

projected to decrease by 10-15% per degree of global warm-
ing, according to the same set of experiments. There is con-
sensus among models that the semi-arid subtropical zone will
experience intensified and extended dry conditions. In addi-

"Because of the great climatic diversity of this region and the
present limitations of GCMs in simulating Latin America’s
regional climate, many studies that have estimated vulnerabil-

the local climate founded on sufficient and reliable real data
and correctly evaluated proxy data. A good example of this
approach appears in a study on “Giobal Warming and Climate
Change in Mexico” (Liverman and O’Brien, 1991), in which
the authors note the importance of acknowledging differences
among climate model projections—as well as between model
simulations and observed climates—because these differences
underscore the uncertainties involved in assessing the regional

converted into modern energy carriers, such as gaseous and liq-

reduced evapotranspiration (Salati and Nobre, 1991; Cerri et

the Amazon basin originates from evapotranspiration (Molion,

clearing could reduce the enormous runoff of the Amazon river
system and result in other far-reaching, undesirable impacts
beyond the cleared areas (Gash and Shuttleworth, 1991).
According to projections by Shukla et al. (1990), if tropical

evapotranspiration and precipitation in the Amazon basin.
Furthermore, increases in the length of the dry season would

unsustainable numbers of sheep along with inappropriate man-

composition and even desertification (Soriano and Movia,
1986). This process is causing the loss of approximately 1,000
km? per year (LAC CDE, 1992); overall, 35% of the area’s pas-
tureland has been transformed into desert (Winograd, 1995).
As a result, the number of sheep decreased by 30% between
1960 and 1988—representing a loss of about US$260 million

approximately 70% of xerophytic shrublands have been pro-

and decreases in plant nutritional value. In some regions,
warmer temperatures and increased summer rainfall, with fewer

Elevational shifts in vegetation and altered hydrological pat-

land uses (¢.g., conservation of endangered species versus
expansion of subsistence agriculture) toward the mountain-

America’s mountain areas that have been exploited through
the cultivation of diverse crops, direct negative effects of cli-

However, continued adaptation to varied climates may be
possible only if the remarkable diversity of local genotypes
is conserved. Development planners and decision makers
should be fully aware that the protection of the wide variety
of wild and domesticated genotypes of major crops in the
Andes also will be crucial for the production of new crop
varieties in the face of changing climatic conditions in other
areas of the world. In 1960, for example, the discovery of
two varieties of tomato in Peru provided the industry with

from cold or anoxia, and expanded habitats as a result of ice
retreat. Offsetting negative factors include increased summer
anoxia, increased demand for food to support higher metabo-

reduced thermal habitat for cold-water species. Individual
effects are difficult to integrate. However, warm-water lakes
generally have higher productivity levels than cold-water lakes;
because of the latitudinal distribution of projected warming,
warm-water lakes will be in areas with the least change in tem-

"Living marine resources include fish, crustaceans and shellfish,
marine mammals, and seaweed. In 1990, the world’s fish catch
was 97 million tons (14 Mt from inland sources and 83 Mt
from marine sources) (FAO, 1992a). Latin America, which is
located between two large oceans, has a recognized wealth of
marine biotic resources, sustaining large schools of fish and
enabling the development of some of the most important salt-
water fisheries in the world. The average annual catch by Latin
American countries during the period 1985-87 was about 13
Mt, or about 17% of the world’s catch (WRI, 1992). Although
these figures do not include catches made by other nations ply-
ing the region’s seas, they provide a clear idea of the econom-
ic importance of the oceans in Latin America. Furthermore,
krill—a_ pelagic member of the crustacean suborder
Euphausiacea—is of great importance in the trophic chain of
the oceans (as food for various fish, birds, and whales, partic-
ularly blue whales and finback whales). From January to April,
swarms of krill (Euphausiacea superba) appear in the
Antarctic Ocean and, because of the predominant sea currents,
move northward into the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans sur-
rounding South America. They have a large impact on fisheries
along the eastern and western coasts of the subcontinent. It
should be stressed that, because of their vast numbers and
nutritive qualities, krill have been regarded by ecologists as a
potential food source for humans. During the Southern
Hemisphere summer, the open waters of the Antarctic Ocean
may contain as much as 20 kg/m of these animals.

"Currently, the annual rate of growth in the world marine catch is
declining (FAO, 1992b) as a consequence of uncontrolled growth
in fishing activities and overfishing of important stocks in the
Atlantic Ocean, including the waters off the South American
coasts. A combination of human activities (e.g., overfishing; pol-
lution of estuaries and coastal oceans; and the destruction of habi-

more powerful effect on marine fisheries than declines expected
from climate change (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 8.2.2).

atmospheric and oceanic circulation defines particular weather

currents is more evident during ENSO events, when resulting
climatic variabilities have strong socioeconomic implications
(see Section 6.2.3). The catastrophic effects of storms and
storm surges are well-known, particularly for their role in exac-

"Changes in the extent and duration of sea ice, combined with
changes in the characteristics of sea currents, may affect the
distribution, abundance, and harvesting of krill—an important
link in the ocean fauna in the southern oceans. If there is a
rapid retreat of sea ice in Antarctica or if the sea ice is reduced
in extent, the krill fishery could become more attractive to
nations involved in krill fishing (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section
16.2.2.2). Such a possibility could critically harm fishing activ-
ities in South America.

"Under IPCC scenarios, saltwater fisheries production should
remain about the same—or undergo a significant increase, if
management deficiencies are corrected. These conclusions
depend on the assumption that interannual and decadal natural
climate variability and the structure and strength of winds and
ocean currents will remain about the same. Changes in any of
these variables are expected to have significant effects on the
distribution of major fish stocks, although not on overall pro-
duction. Even without major changes in atmospheric and ocean-
ic circulation, local shifts in centers of production and mixes of
species in marine and fresh waters are expected to occur as
ecosystems are displaced geographically and change internally.

"Global warming may lead to poleward shifts in species ranges
and migration patterns within the seas along the South
American coast; this shift could lead to increased survival of
economically valuable species and increased yields in marine
fisheries. Such cases have been observed as a result of the large
and intense 1983 El Nino event (Wooster and Fluharty, 1985),
which may be considered a test for future climate scenarios.
However, the impacts of El Nino are not the same for different
regions of the Pacific Ocean. In fact, in areas where productiv-
ity depends on upwelling (e.g., the Pacific coast of Peru and
Chile), the El Nifo phenomenon leads to a decrease in ocean
productivity (Jordan Sotelo, 1986; Budyko and Izrael, 1987;
Lapenis et al., 1990; IPCC 1996, WG II, Box 16.6).

"In tropical latitudes, most migratory organisms are expected to
be able to tolerate climate warming, but the fate of sedentary
species will be highly dependent on local climate changes. For
example, corals are sensitive to changes in temperature; coral
bleaching occurred during El Nino events in 1983 and 1987
(Glynn, 1989; Brown and Odgen, 1993), when the ocean tem-
peratures were higher than normal. Therefore, under warmer
environmental conditions resulting from climate change, the
expectation is that corals and other sedentary species would be
affected. Coral mortality is positively correlated with the inten-
sity and length of warming episodes (Glynn, 1989; Glynn and
Cruz, 1990); recent paleoclimatic investigations of ENSO phe-
nomena show that coral records can be read as a proxy for
increased sea-surface temperarures (SSTs), potentially over
several thousand years (Cole ef al., 1992; Shen, 1993).
Researchers recognize, however, that other environmental
stresses—such as pollution, sedimentation, or nutrient influx—
also would affect corals and other sedentary species (Maul,
1993; Milliman, 1993; IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 9.4).

consequence of sea-level rise (Costa et al., 1994). It also is
apparent that mangrove communities starve in microtidal, sed-

represent a mixed, and probably synergistic, series of impacts
on an already overstressed context. There also may be syner-

them. For instance, flooding conditions in the Pampas, in the
province of Buenos Aires, would be exacerbated by any level
of sea-level rise because the effectiveness of the Salado river as
the only drainage system for this flatland would be reduced by
sea-level rise. Some coastal sectors in Central America and on
the Atlantic coast of South America would be subject to inun-
dation risk. Flat areas—such as the Amazon, Orinoco, and
Parana river deltas—and the mouths of other rivers, such as the
Magdalena in Colombia, would be affected by sea-level rise
(IPCC, 1990). Estuaries like the Rio de la Plata also would suf-

freshwater supply. These effects will depend on the amount of
sea-level rise and the characteristics of atmospheric and ocean-

"Latin America has about 23% of the world’s potential arable
land, although—in contrast with other regions—it maintains a
high percentage of natural ecosystems (UNEP, 1992). The total

less than 10% of the total area of the Latin American region (see
Annex D). About 306 million ha (72.7%) of the agricultural
drylands in South America (i.e., irrigated lands, rain-fed crop-
lands, and rangelands) suffer from moderate to extreme deteri-
oration (UNEP, 1992), and about 47% of the soils in grazing
lands have lost their fertility (LAC CDE, 1992). These land
degradation figures include erosion and soil degradation on hill-
sides and in mountain areas, as well as desertification by over-
grazing, salinization, and alkalinization of irrigated soils in
tropical pasture lands. The area of irrigated land has increased
substantially: Data for the periods 1966-68 and 1986-88 show
that irrigated land has increased from 8,674,000 ha to
14,040,000 ha (UNEP, 1992). A preliminary calculation by the

driven by two factors—changes in climate (temperature and precipitation) and CO, enrichment. The interactions of these

perature, which shortens the duration of crop growth stages. New and fluctuating weather patterns could have a strong
negative impact on economic activities in agriculture. The majority of Belizean people who are highly dependent on

(e.g., salinization resulting from increased irrigation, which is
not considered in the models) are likely to severely limit the
capacity for adaptation and hinder the expansion of agricultural
frontiers. Estimated net economic impacts of climate change on

climate change simulation, Kattemberg et al. (IPCC 1996,

cerning extreme events. Studies in temperate and subtropical
countries have shown increases in daily death rates associated
with extreme outdoor temperatures. Mortality increases much
more steeply with rising temperatures than with falling tem-

"Health has been defined by the World Health Organization
(WHO) as “a state of complete physical, mental, and social
well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.”
Different aspects of this well-being are related to weather and
climate; primarily, however, it depends fully on the communi-
ty’s welfare. Because Latin America has a large tropical and
subtropical environment, its inhabitants already are exposed to
a number of infectious diseases and pests typical of these
zones. The most vulnerable communities are those living in
poverty, those with a high prevalence of undernutrition, and
those with chronic exposure to infectious disease agents (IPCC
1996, WG II, Section 18.1.3). As a result, an increasing num-
ber of people who are living under these critical conditions in
Latin America would be affected if, as expected, global warm-

extreme weather events such as storms, floods, and droughts,

social problems that stem from the dislocation of people,
adverse psychological effects, and other stresses (IPCC 1996,

located on hills, as well as human settlements located in flood-

adversely affect human health (Section 6.3.6). These over-
crowded and poorly-serviced peri-urban settlements also pro-

graphical and elevational dispersion of vectors (Burgos et al.,
1994; Curto de Casas et al., 1994), as well as their population
dynamics and behavior. Precipitation is an important factor for
vectors with aquatic stages, such as mosquitoes and blackflies,
because breeding places are increased and maintained by rain-
fall. Winds may contribute to the dispersion of some flying
insects, such as mosquitoes, blackflies, and sandflies (Ando et

achieved importance and could reach critical levels in South
America. Some viruses have had unexpected outbreaks—such
as arenaviruses in Argentina and Bolivia (PAHO, 1996) and
hantaviruses in the south of Argentina; their relationship to cli-
mate change is not yet well understood. Fungi such as
Paracoccidiodes brasiliensis—which require high humidity
and generally are associated with rainfall regimes of
500-2,000 mm/yr and average temperatures of 14-30°C—are
found in some areas of South America (e.g., Brazil, Venezuela,
and northern Argentina) (Restrepo et al., 1972), where this
mycosis is becoming endemic. It may spread if climate change
provides adequate conditions to start the epidemiological
chain. In this connection, increasing surface traffic that has
resulted from commercial activity stemming from the new
regional common market—Mercosur—may call for the devel-
opment of appropriate sanitary barriers (e.g., disinfection of

"Infectious and parasitic diseases are important causes of mor-
bidity and mortality in Latin America, and the main cause of
death in children (PAHO, 1994). Some infectious diseases are
more common in tropical and subtropical areas than in temper-
ate or cold areas. Therefore, global warming would tend to
extend their area of influence or increase the importance of
outbreaks. Some of these diseases are food- or water-related
infections; after they are introduced into a region, they show a
tendency to spread over the whole region. Viral, bacterial, and
protozoan agents of diarrhea can survive in water—especially
in warmer waters—for long periods of time and thus spread at
increased rates in rainfall periods, enhancing their transmissi-
bility among people. An example is cholera, which was intro-
duced into Peru in 1993. It produced an outbreak that spread to
most of the South American subcontinent, including places as
far as Buenos Aires (PAHO, 1994). Cholera’s relation to the
ENSO phenomenon was proposed by Colwell (1996). This dis-
ease and other diarrheas and dysenteries are associated with the
distribution and quality of surface water, as well as with flood-
ing and water shortages. These conditions alter the population
dynamics of organisms, impede personal hygiene, and impair
local sewage systems. Increases in coastal algal blooming also
may amplify the proliferation and transmission of Vibrio

"Chagas’ disease, or American trypanosomiasis, is a parasitic
disease produced by the flagellate Trypanosoma cruzi. This
infection is one of the most important public health scourges in
Latin America. It affects the human digestive and nervous sys-
tems and especially the heart. Its vectors span latitudes from
42°N to 46°S, with an elevational dispersion ranging from sea
level to about 4,100 m above sea level (Bejarano, 1967).
However, the disease’s endemic area is much smaller; it is con-
fined mainly to tropical and subtropical regions, especially in
poverty-stricken areas. Triatoma infestans—the most impor-
tant vector of Tripanosoma cruzi—is found in Argentina,
Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay. Most of
the population of this vector lives within or around human
habitats, particularly in poor rural dwellings that have mud
walls and roofs made of tree branches, straw, or palm leaves.
Colonies also exist outdoors in places with cold winters and
warm summers (Carcavallo and Martinez, 1972). Climate
change may influence the population dynamics of vectors
(Hack, 1955; Burgos et al., 1994), as well as the number of
blood-feedings and, therefore, the possibilities of infective
indirect contacts (Catala, 1991; Catala et al., 1992).

"Dengue and yellow fever involve similar viruses and epidemi-
ology; they are transmitted by the same urban vector, the Aedes
aegypti mosquito. Although this species is recognized as the
main vector, another (Aedes albopictus) has invaded the
American continent, colonizing the United States and Brazil.
In Latin America, dengue currently is more active than yellow
fever. Dengue is a severe, influenza-like virus; it sometimes
takes the form of hemorragic fever, and it is lethal about 15%
of the time. Studies performed in Mexico have shown that an
increase of 3-4°C in mean temperatures may double the trans-
mission rate (Koopman et al., 1991), and transmission is com-
mon in areas with temperatures below 20°C (Halstead, 1990).
Cases of dengue at 1,700 m above sea level—an elevation
never before attained—were found in the state of Guerrero
(Herrera-Basto et al., 1992) and have since been found at even
higher elevations in other regions. Apparently, the thermal
limit of Aedes aegypti could be a midwinter temperature of
10°C (Shope, 1991). Junin et al. (1995) reported re-infestation
of the city of Buenos Aires by this species—after 30 years of
formally declared erradication. Temperature is considered to be
a predictor of dengue outbreaks. Martens et al. (1997) have
identified epidemiological areas too cold for the transmission
of the virus, including those at the current temperature of
Mexico City.

"In Latin America, the region with the largest urbanization rate,
a large spectrum of urban settlements has been established at
different elevations (from sea level to mountain ranges exceed-
ing 3,000 m). These locations have a wide variety of geo-
graphic and topographic characteristics (see Figure 6-1).
Because weather and climate events already are affecting envi-
ronmental conditions, climate change may be expected to have
a host of direct and indirect effects on human settlements, even
where urban migration is not a factor. However, such migra-
tion is significant in some countries of the region. In fact, large
groups of people migrate internally and regionally from rural,
drought-prone areas (Ezcurra, 1990) or poverty stricken com-
munities (Canziani, 1996) to modern, well-developed cities.
Unemployment rates indicate that this tendency will continue,
particularly because cities and urban/industrial/commercial
nuclei in Latin America offer better opportunities for employ-
ment than do those in other regions. Such cities may become
the kernels of Latin American megalopolises, attracting people
from less-developed neighboring countries as well as from
within. Population displacements are likely to have serious

"Agro-industry is of relatively greater significance in Latin
American countries where activities associated with agriculture
constitute the bulk of the economy, than elsewhere. Agro-indus-

in precipitation patterns and the frequency and intensity of
extreme weather events. Globalization undoubtedly will better
define the future activities of some Latin American countries.
The strategy of “dumping” industrialized products—which has
been carried out by more developed countries and some of the
Far East’s emerging economies—suggests that Latin American
countries might well reorient their development toward agro-
industry to take advantage of their natural resources and secure
a place in international markets. The inception of regional mar-
kets would facilitate a combination of agricultural and agro-
industrial production capacities within the region, assuming that
available natural resources are evaluated, through monitoring
and research, in the light of projected climate change. This route
could lead to the region’s sustainable development and the
improvement of its productive capacity to satisfy the demands

"An important domain within these agro-industries is the devel-
opment of energy sources through biomass exploitation (see
Section 6.3.4). In Brazil, the Fuel-Alcohol Program—one of
the largest commercial biomass-to-energy programs—has
facilitated the substitution of ethanol for gasoline in passenger
cars and light vehicles (Goldenberg ef al., 1993).
Technological advances, including more efficient production
and processing of sugarcane, are responsible for the availabili-
ty and low price of ethanol. The transition to ethanol fuel has
reduced Brazil’s dependence on foreign oil (thus lowering its
import-export ratio), created significant employment opportu-
nities, and greatly improved urban air quality. In addition,
because sugarcane-derived ethanol is a renewable resource
(cane is replanted at the same time that it is harvested), the
combustion of ethanol adds virtually no net CO, to the atmos-
phere—and thus helps reduce the threat of global warming.
Hydropower production would be influenced by changes in
precipitation; whether these changes would be beneficial
depends heavily on the relationship between seasonal patterns
of precipitation and electricity demand. In Costa Rica and the
Cuyo region in Argentina, for example, energy production
already is affected by climate variability. Whereas hydroelec-

els to encompass hemispheric peculiarities (as is being done in
Australasia) but also for developing appropriate regional cli-
mate models that should have the capacity, inter alia, to pro-
vide appropriate climate scenarios for running hydrological
models for the region’s river basins.

"This analysis once again underscores the fact that the region
suffers from insufficiently dense and reliable observation net-
works and that other basic information—biological, economic,
and social—necessary to build up complete and coherent
regional scenarios is missing. Last but not least, appropriate
coordination with the Australasian countries, as well as with
the United States and Canada, is becoming more and more crit-
ical because of common factors affecting climate variability
(e.g., the ENSO phenomenon) and climate change over these
regions.

"In most managed ecosystems and human systems, adaptation
to climate change in Latin America is not as much an issue of
scientific knowledge or technical feasibility as of socioeco-
nomic and cultural factors and political decisions. It is
extremely difficult at this stage to analyze the viability of dif-
ferent options because their cost/benefit ratio depends on eco-
logical and social conditions and the integration of local and
external markets. In virtually all cases, political measures (e.g.,
credits, subsidies); educational programs; and interactive com-
munication among experts, policymakers, and stakeholders are
needed—especially within local communities—to implement
viable adaptation options. Table 6-9 presents a very prelimi-
nary summary of possible adaptation options for different sec-
tors within Latin America.
"	Text
"Other characteristics further differentiate the two hemi-
spheres. The geographical features of the Southern
Hemisphere (and Latin America in particular) consist mainly
of a solid continent on the South Pole (the Antarctic); a very
large oceanic mass with a well-known thermal moderating
Capacity; a subcontinent (South America) extending to the
southernmost latitudes; and a vertebral mountain chain (the
Cordillerra de los Andes) running from north to south over the
entire subcontinent—all sandwiched between the two largest
oceans of the world. Another important difference affecting
the middle atmosphere over this region is the seasonal and
regional formation of the Antarctic ozone hole. This remark-
able stratospheric ozone depletion, combined with dynamic
changes in middle atmospheric circulation, has the double
impact of creating a window for infrared radiation—which
globally compensates about 25% of GHG warming effects—
"	Text
"Latin America has the expertise needed for the study of cli-
mate, climate variability, and climate change—as is apparent
from the relatively ample bibliography of research by local
authors. This expertise is important because recent observa-
tions have shown that the Southern Hemisphere, where the
largest portion of the region lies, is warming more than the
Northern Hemisphere. The very heavily-populated land mass-
es in the north produce more atmospheric pollution (in partic-
ular, sulfate aerosols and particulates), which dampens the
heating capacity of solar radiation on the Earth. This situation
is quite different from that in the oceanic Southern
Hemisphere, where the distribution and density of air pollu-
tants are remarkably lower. As a result, the absorption and
reflection of incoming solar radiation do not counteract the
background release of GHGs to the extent that they do in the
north.
"	Text
"In summary, the situation in Latin America calls for specific
research initiatives; comprehensive ecological and
socioeconomic databases; appropriate data validation tech-
niques; proxy data capture, particularly regarding the neigh-
boring Antarctic continent (which began keeping regional
records only after the 1958 geophysical year); and appropri-
ate training of personnel, particularly regarding integrated
assessments and development of appropriate adaptation
option methodologies. More fundamental research on ecosys-
tem functioning, hydrographic systems, and interactions
between land use and technological approaches by different
communities is indispensable for the region to thoroughly
undertake integrated assessments of potential impacts of cli-
mate change and develop appropriate adaptation and mitiga-
tion alternatives. Therefore, combined actions with countries
in neighboring regions, such as those already implemented
through joint activities with the USCSP, and the organization
of activities within the Valdivia Group—which associates
Latin American countries in the temperate Southern
Hemisphere with activities of common interest in Australia,
New Zealand, and South Africa—are in order. The participa-
tion of grassroots organizations and NGOs also is essential
for achieving sustainable development in the region vis-a-vis
climate change.

"Climate trends: Records of annual temperatures during the peri-
od 1900-96 show almost no change for most of the Middle East
region, but a 1-2°C/century increase for central Asia. There was
a 0.7°C increase from 1900 to 1996 for the region as a whole.
There was no discernible trend in annual precipitation during
1900-95 for the region as a whole, nor in most parts of the

"The region has a large area dominated by mountains, such as the
Hindu Kush, Karakoram, and Tien Shan mountains in the east-
ern part of the region. Mountain areas are under pressure from
human use, which is leading to land degradation in some areas.
Some of the mountains have permanent glaciers, which will be
affected by climate change. Glacial melt is projected to increase
under climate change, leading to increased flows in some river
systems for a few decades; this will be followed, however, by
a reduction in flow as the glaciers disappear—creating larger
areas of arid, interior deserts in low- and mid-lying parts of
central Asia.

"Climate scenarios: Climate models project that temperatures in
the region will increase by 1-2°C by 2030-2050, with the
greatest increases in winter in the northeast and in summer in

slightly in the winter throughout the region and in the summer
to remain the same in the northeast and increase in the south-
west (i.e., the southern part of the Arabian peninsula). These
precipitation projections vary from model to model and are
unlikely to be significant. Because of projected increases in
temperatures, higher evaporation is expected. Soil moisture is
projected to decrease in most parts of the region, which may
lead to increased areas of soil degradation.

"woodlands. Vegetation models project little change in most arid
(or desert) vegetation types under climate change projections.
The impacts may be greater in the semi-arid lands of the region
than in the arid lands, especially in composition and distribution
of vegetation types. The projected small increase in precipita-
tion is unlikely to improve land conditions in the next century,
partly because soil conditions take a long time to improve and
partly because human pressure on these systems may contribute
to land degradation. Improved water-use efficiency by some
plants under elevated carbon dioxide (CO;) may lead to some
improvement in plant productivity and changes in ecosystem
composition. Grasslands, livestock, and water resources are
likely io be most vulnerable to climate change in this region
because they are located mostly in marginal areas. Management
options, such as better stock management and more integrated
agroecosystems, could improve land conditions and counteract
pressures arising from climate change.

"Integration: Countries of the FSU are undergoing major eco-

“win-win” opportunities for the conservation of resources, to
offset the impacts of climate change. Opportunities to change
crop types and introduce more efficient irrigation are among
the most promising. Human activity can exacerbate the effect
of climate change in this arid/semi-arid region, leading to long-
term detrimental effects on ecosystems and human health. The
Aral Sea is an illustrative example of the multiplicative effects
of resource overuse, which can lead to local environmental and
even climate change. Extensive redirection of water from feed-
er rivers to irrigated agriculture since 1960 has led to a reduc-
tion in the surface area of the lake, as well as damage to the
surrounding wetlands and the species that depend on them. Air
temperature in the vicinity of the lake has increased. Saline and
polluted dust from the exposed lake bed has been implicated in
significant health problems and increases in infant mortality.

"Food and Fiber: Land degradation problems and limited water
supplies constrain present agricultural productivity and threat-

projections of the impacts of climate change on food and fiber

have suggested some negative impacts on wheat yields. There
are also projected increases (e.g., winter wheat in Kazakstan).
Many of the options available for combating existing problems
will contribute to reducing the anticipated impacts of climate
change. Food and fiber production concentrated on more inten-
sively managed lands could lead to greater reliability in food
production and reduce the detrimental impacts of extreme cli-
matic events, such as drought, on rangeland systems.
Implementation of more flexible risk-management strategies
(e.g., long-term and appropriate stocking rates, responding to
variations in precipitation by changing animal numbers annu-
ally)}—along with the use of a wider variety of domestic ani-

"The region is mostly semi-arid and arid, with significant areas
of extreme aridity (i.e., deserts, as defined in IPCC 1996, WG
Il, Chapter 3). All areas experience wide fluctuations in rainfall,
and their native plants and animals are adapted to coping with
sequences of extreme climatic conditions. In many of these eco-
logical systems, the initial climatic changes are unlikely to cre-
ate conditions significantly outside the present range of varia-
tion (IPCC 1996, WG IL, Chapter 3); thus, impacts from climate
change may not be apparent for several decades.

"Even where wetter conditions prevail, however, any “green-
ing” of the deserts and rangelands often might be counteracted
by pressure from the expanding human population and associ-
ated desertification problems. Climatic conditions and social
pressures vary greatly in a region that ranges from
Mediterranean climate to extreme deserts, with economies as
varied as those of the oil producing states, Israel, and the coun-
tries of the FSU. In the latter group of countries, the impacts of
climate change are likely to be relatively small compared with
the impacts of economic transitions on agricultural systems
and the environment (see Section 7.3.4.1).

"The processes associated with changed climatic and atmos-
pheric conditions are expected to lead to changes in the com-
position of many plant communities—such as the mix between
grasses and shrubs or weeds and non-weeds (IPCC 1996, WG
II, Chapters 2 and 3). There also is evidence that the forage
quality (e.g., the ratio of nitrogen to carbon) and the protein
content of some cereals may decline. Although it has not been
possible to test the effects of high CO, atmospheres on exten-
sive areas of crops and pastures with large grazing animals
(Diaz, 1995), it is possible that they may affect farm manage-
ment systems significantly.

"Models that project changes in global vegetation in response to
a doubled-CO,-driven climate suggest little change in desert
(arid) communities. One study, which used four general circu-
lation model (GCM) climate projections, concluded that
deserts were the most stable of the 16 vegetation types consid-
ered (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 3); it estimated that only
59-66% of all combined vegetation types for the world would
remain in the same category, whereas 82-92% of existing
deserts would retain this classification. The impact of climate
change may be greater in the semi-arid areas of the region than
in the arid areas. Agriculture, natural grasslands, livestock, and
water resources in marginal areas are most likely to be vulner-
able to climate change (Smith et al., 1996).

"Although precipitation is projected by some models to increase
slightly, this increase will have little impact because most of
the region will remain arid. In rangelands or semi-arid lands,
increased precipitation eventually may lead to improved soil
conditions, including larger accumulations of organic matter,
improved soil field capacity, enhanced moisture availability,
and changed runoff patterns (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 3).
This process is slow (taking 400 years or more), however, so
little advantage will accrue to these ecosystems during the next
century. A more important process may be the demonstrated
increase in the water-use efficiency of plants when high levels
of CO, are present in the atmosphere (Bazzaz et al., 1996). In
atmospheres rich in CO,, plants can take up the CO, necessary
for photosynthesis with less water loss from their stomatal
pores. This efficiency gain has been demonstrated to be most
advantageous in plants growing in water-limited circum-
stances—and thus may lead to higher productivity throughout
much of the region. The response of individual species and
communities varies considerably, however. In high-CO, condi-
tions, some species conserve water by using less water to main-
tain previous rates of productivity (i.e., photosynthesis); other
species increase their productivity and maintain relatively high
tates of water use. There is little understanding about how
whole communities of plants respond, and, unfortunately, few
studies have been done within the region. Nevertheless, the net
result of increased water-use efficiency should be increased
plant productivity in arid and semi-arid ecosystems; this effect

"The region is characterized by arid and semi-arid lands, on
which it depends for much of its economic activity (e.g.,
agriculture and livestock grazing in rangelands). These
ecosystems are under extreme pressure from human activi-
ties and current climatic conditions (e.g., high temperatures
and prolonged droughts). Because of the current marginal-
ity of soil-water and nutrient reserves, some ecosystems in
semi-arid regions may be among the first to show the effects
of climate change. However, a number of management
options (e.g. better stock management, more-integrated
agroecosystems) could improve land conditions.

The relatively hospitable mountain regions are under par-
ticular pressure from human settlements and commercial
cultivation, which have led to land degradation and adverse
effects on water supply. Glacial melt is forecast to increase
under climate change, which would lead to increased sum-
mer flows in some river systems for a few decades, followed
by a reduction in flow as the glaciers disappear.

A tenth of the world’s known species of higher plants and
animals occurs in this region. Some countries (particular-
ly Turkey and Tajikistan) are centers of origin for many

As mountain glaciers begin to disappear, the volume of sum-

during dry periods, and thus can enhance recharge to major
aquifers (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 6.3.3.2.3). However, in
semi-arid and arid areas, where groundwater recharge occurs
after flood events, changes in the frequency and magnitude of

nature and severity of the desertification problem, mainly
because of the lack of adequate data. Many large-scale studies
have suggested that the annual rate of expansion of desertified
lands in central Asia ranges from 0.5% to 0.7% of the arid
zone. Approximately 570 million ha in the region are classified
as arid land. Assuming a conservative rate of expansion of
0.5% per annum, 3 million ha of land are becoming desertified
every year. Arid-land desertification could occur faster if
human and livestock populations continue to increase and par-
ticularly if the resilience of arid regions is negatively affected
by climate change. Some recent research, however, has not
supported the expanding-desert hypothesis. During favorable
or “wet” years, there is little evidence to suggest that the deser-
tification front has expanded. The different views regarding the
importance of human abuse versus adverse climatic conditions
in causing desertification and the lack of agreement on the
scale of the problem point to the need for a better understand-
ing of the problem and, in particular, better and more compre-
hensive data on its nature and extent. There is little doubt that
desertification is an important environmental problem that
needs to be addressed urgently—and that climate change will
have an impact on it (IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 4), with

Estimating effects on marketed goods and services (e.g., com-

energy savings in winter) in monetary terms is relatively
straightforward because the prices are known. Estimating dam-

examining market transactions where such goods or services
are implicitly traded (e.g., sites of landscape beauty) or through
interviewing people to determine their preferences (i-e., their
willingness to pay to secure a benefit or willingness to accept
compensation for a loss). In Organisation for Economic

Water resources were overcommitted to agriculture and were

because agricultural products now are being traded on world

use of integrated pest management, more efficient irrigation sys-

"The availability of better information on the potential impacts
of climate change and the interaction of these impacts with
other important factors that influence the health and productiv-

"Within the North American region (defined for the purposes of
this report as the portion of continental North America south of
the Arctic Circle and north of the U.S.-Mexico border), vul-
nerability to climate change varies significantly from sector to
sector and from subregion to subregion. Recognition of this
variability or subregional “texture” is important in understand-
ing the potential effects of climate change on North America
and in formulating viable response strategies.
"	Text
"Virtually all sectors within North America are vulnerable to cli-
mate change to some degree in some subregions. Although
many sectors and regions are sensitive to climate change, the
technological capability to adapt to climate change is readily
available, for the most part. If appropriate adaptation strategies
are identified and implemented in a timely fashion, the overall
vulnerability of the region may be reduced. However, uncer-
tainties exist about the feasibility of implementation and effi-
cacy of technological adaptation.
"	Text
"Comprising most of Canada and the contiguous United States,
this large area is diverse in terms of its geological, ecological,
climatic, and socioeconomic structures. Temperature extremes
range from well below -40°C in northern latitudes during the
winter months to greater than +40°C in southern latitudes during
the summer. The regional atmospheric circulation is governed
mainly by upper-level westerly winds and subtropical weather
systems, with tropical storms occasionally impacting on the Gulf
of Mexico and Atlantic coasts during summer and autumn. The
Great Plains (including the Canadian Prairies) and southeastern
U.S. experience more severe weather—in the form of thunder-
storms, tornadoes, and hail—than any other region of the world.
"	Text
"Our current understanding of the potential impacts of climate
change is limited by critical uncertainties. One important
uncertainty relates to the inadequacy of regional-scale climate
projections relative to the spatial scales of variability in North
American natural and human systems. This uncertainty is com-
pounded further by the uncertainties inherent in ecological,
economic, and social models—which thereby further limit our
ability to identify the full extent of impacts or prescriptive
adaptation measures. Given these uncertainties, particularly the
inability to forecast futures, conclusions about regional
impacts are not yet reliable and are limited to the sensitivity
and vulnerability of physical, biological, and socioeconomic
Systems to climate change and climate variability.
"	Text
"The characteristics of the subregions and sectors of North
America suggest that neither the impacts of climate change nor
the response options will be uniform. This assessment suggests
that there will be differences in the impacts of climate change
across the region and within particular sectors. In fact, simply
considering the relative climate sensitivity of different sectors
or systems within a particular subregion (i.e., climate-sensitive,
climate-insensitive, or climate-limited) would suggest differ-
entiated impacts. This diversity also is reflected in the available
response options. Sectors and subregions will need to adopt
response options to alleviate negative impacts or take advan-
tage of opportunities that not only address the impacts but are
tailored to the needs and characteristics of that subregion.
"	Text
"Within most natural and human systems in North America, cur-
rent climate—including its variability—frequently is a limiting
factor. Climate, however, is only one of many factors that
determine the overall condition of these systems. For example,
projected population changes in North America and associated
changes in land use and air and water quality will continue to
put pressure on natural ecosystems (e.g., rangelands, wetlands,
and coastal ecosystems). Projected changes in climate should
be seen as an additional factor that can influence the health and
existence of these ecosystems. In some cases, changes in cli-
mate will provide adaptive opportunities or could alleviate the
pressure of multiple stresses; in other cases, climate change
could hasten or broaden negative impacts, leading to reduced
function or elimination of ecosystems.
"	Text
"Even when current adaptive capability has been factored in,
long-lived natural forest ecosystems in the east and interior
west; water resources in the southern plains; agriculture in the
southeast and southern plains; human health in areas current-
ly experiencing diminished urban air quality; northern
ecosystems and habitats; estuarine beaches in developed
areas; and low-latitude cold-water fisheries will remain
among the most vulnerable sectors and regions. West coast
coniferous forests; some western rangelands; energy costs for
heating in the northern latitudes; salting and snow clearance
costs; open-water season in northern channels and ports; and
agriculture in the northern latitudes, the interior west, and
west coast may benefit from opportunities associated with
warmer temperatures or potentially from carbon dioxide
(CO;) fertilization.

"The relatively certain northward shift of the southern boundary
of permafrost areas (projected to be about 500 km by the mid-
dle of the 21st century) will impact ecosystems, infrastructure,
and wildlife in the altered areas through terrain slumping,
increased sediment loadings to rivers and lakes, and dramati-
cally altered hydrology; affected peatlands could become
sources rather than sinks for atmospheric carbon. Projections
suggest that peatlands may disappear from south of 60°N in the
Mackenzie Basin; patchy arctic wetlands currently supported
by surface flow also may not persist.

"Forests may die or decline in density in some regions because
of drought, pest infestations, and fire; in other regions, forests
may increase in both area and density. Models suggest that
total potential forest area could increase by as much as
25-44%. For some individual forest types, however, range
expansions could be preceded by decline or dieback over
19-96% of their area while the climate and ecosystems are
adjusting, but before an equilibrium is attained. Even though
total forest area could increase, northward shifts in distribution
could produce losses in forest area in the United States.
"	Text
"Increased temperatures could reduce sub-arctic (i.e., tundra
and taiga/tundra) ecosystems. Loss of migratory wildfowl and
mammal breeding and forage habitats may occur within the
taiga/tundra, which is projected to nearly disappear from
mainland areas. This ecozone currently is the home of the
majority of the Inuit population. It also provides the major
breeding and nesting grounds for a variety of migratory birds
and the major summer range and calving grounds for Canada’s
largest caribou herd, as well as habitat for a number of eco-
logically significant plant and animal species critical to the
subsistence lifestyles of the indigenous peoples. Current bio-
geographic model projections suggest that tundra and
taiga/tundra ecosystems may be reduced by as much as two-
thirds of their present size, reducing the regional storage of
carbon in the higher latitudes of North America—which may
shift the tundra region from a net sink to a net source of CO,
for the tundra region.
"	Text
"Elevated CO, concentrations may alter the nitrogen cycle,
drought survival mechanisms (e.g., the rate of depletion of soil
water by grasses), and fire frequency—potentially decreasing
forage quality and impacting forage production on rangelands.
Increases in CO, and changes in regional climate could exacer-
bate the existing problem of loss of production on western range-
lands related to woody and noxious plant invasions by acceler-
ating the invasion of woody C; plants (many crop and tree
species) into mostly C, (tropical grasses, many weed species )
grasslands. Mechanisms include changes in water-use efficiency
(WUE), the nitrogen cycle (increase in carbon-to-nitrogen ratio
and concentrations of unpalatable and toxic substances), drought
survival mechanisms, and fire frequency. Growth and reproduc-
tion of individual animals could decrease as CO, concentrations
tise, without dietary supplementation. However, the data are
ambiguous, and production may increase in some grassland
ecosystems. Uncertainty exists in our ability to predict ecosys-
tem or individual species responses to elevated CO, and global
warming at either the regional or global scale.

"Geographic ranges of forest ecosystems are expected to shift
northward and upward in altitude, but forests cannot move
across the land surface as rapidly as climate is projected to
change. The faster the rate of climate change, the greater the
probability of ecosystem disruption and species extinction.
Climate-induced dieback could begin within a few decades
from the present and might be enhanced by increases in pest
infestations and fire. Alternatively, forest growth might
increase in the early stages of global warming, followed by
drought-induced forest dieback after higher temperatures have
significantly increased evaporative demand. Migration into
colder areas may be limited by seed dispersal (e.g., barriers
may exist because of urbanization and changing land-use pat-
terns), seedling establishment, and poor soils. As forests
expand or contract in response to climate change, they will
likely either replace or be replaced by savannas, shrublands, or
grasslands. Imbalances between rates of expansion and con-
traction could result in a large pulse of carbon to the atmos-
phere during the transition.

high latitudes. Increases in temperature lead to a rise in evapo-
transpiration—which, unless offset by large increases in pre-
cipitation or decreases in plant water use, results in declines in
runoff, lake levels, and groundwater recharge and levels. The
greatest impact of declines in supply will be in arid and
semi-arid regions and in areas with a high ratio of use relative
to available renewable supply, as well as in basins with multi-
ple competing uses. Alternatively, regions that experience sub-
stantial increases in precipitation are likely to have substantial
increases in runoff and river flows.

"Ice-jam patterns are likely to be altered. In New England, the
Atlantic provinces, the Great Lakes, and central Plains areas, as
well as northern regions susceptible to spring flooding,
changes in late winter-early spring precipitation patterns could
result in diminished frequency of ice jams and flooding.
Damages caused by these events currently are estimated to cost
Canadians CAN$60 million and Americans US$100 million
annually, though northern deltas and wetlands appear to
depend on the resulting periodic recharge. Depending on the
specific pattern of altering climate, mid-latitude areas where
ice jams presently are uncommon-—-such as the prairies; central
Ontario and Quebec; and parts of Maine, New Brunswick,
Newfoundland, and Labrador—may suffer from an increase in
frequency and/or severity of winter breakup and associated
jamming.

"Climate projections suggest increased runoff in winter and
early spring but reduced flows during summer in regions in
which hydrology is dominated by snowmelt. Glaciers are
expected to retreat, and their contributions to summer flows
will decline as peak flows shift to winter or early spring. In
mountainous regions, particularly at mid-elevations, warming
leads to a long-term reduction in peak snow-water equivalent;
the snowpack builds later and melts sooner. Snow- or glacier-
fed river and reservoir systems that supply spring and summer
flow during the critical periods of high agricultural and munic-
ipal demand and low precipitation may tend to release their
water earlier in the year, which would reduce supplies during
summer droughts. Water supplies and water quality, irrigation,
hydroelectric generation, tourism, and fish habitat, as well as
the viability of the livestock industry, may be negatively
impacted. The Great Plains of the United States and prairie
regions of Canada and California are particularly vulnerable.

"Increases in hydrological variability (larger floods and longer
droughts) are likely to result in increased sediment loading and
erosion, degraded shorelines, reductions in water quality,
reduced water supply for dilution of point-source water pollu-
tants and assimilation of waste heat loads, and reduced stabil-
ity of aquatic ecosystems. Projected changes in snowfall and
snowmelt—as well as suggested increases in warm-period
rainfall intensity—could shift the periodicity of the flood
regime in North America, possibly stressing the adequacy of
dams, culverts, levees, storm drains, and other flood prevention
infrastructures. The impacts of flooding are likely to be largest
in arid regions, where riparian vegetation is sparse; in agricul-
tural areas during winter, when soils are more exposed; and in
urban areas with more impervious surfaces. Increases in hydro-
logical variability may reduce productivity and biodiversity in
streams and rivers and have large impacts on water resources
management in North America, with increased expenditures
for flood management. Increases in water temperature and
reduced flows in streams and rivers may result in lower dis-
solved oxygen concentrations, particularly in summer low-
flow periods in low- and mid-latitude areas.

"Climate modifications that lead to changes in daily and inter-
annual variability in temperatures and, in particular, precipi-
tation will impact crop yields. Although changes in average
temperature and precipitation can be expected to impact agri-
culture, few studies have considered the effects of increased
climate variability on crop and livestock production. Increased
variability in daily and interannual temperature and precipita-
tion are likely to be as important or more important than the
effects of mean changes in climate. Droughts, floods, and
increased risks of winter injury will contribute to a greater fre-

likely to encourage adaptive management strategies. Private
forest managers have the financial incentive and the flexibility

They can use several available techniques: short rotations to
reduce the length of time that a tree is influenced by unfavor-

However, the more rapid the rate of climate change, the more
it may strain the ability to create infrastructure for seeding or
planting of trees, or to support the supply of timber if there is
a large amount of salvage. A fast rate of warming also may

readings in excess of 1050 mb. To the west of the Rockies,
warmer maritime airflow off the Pacific Ocean produces
milder winters along the coast; the western cordillera effec-
tively restricts this mild air from reaching and thus modifying
temperatures in the interior. The eastern maritime regions of
the continent enjoy much less warming influence from the
Atlantic Ocean during these cold air outbreaks because the pre-
vailing air flow is off the land (Schneider, 1996). Nevertheless,
in winter the east and west coastal regions of Canada and the
United States usually are warmer than inland regions, with the
Pacific and Gulf coasts and Florida experiencing the shortest
and mildest winters (Schneider, 1996).

"North America possesses a multitude of diverse regional cli-
mates as a consequence of its vastness, its topography, and its
being surrounded by oceans and seas with widely varying ther-
mal characteristics. The North American region as analyzed in
this report (see Figure A-3 in Annex A) extends latitudinally
from approximately the Arctic Circle to the Tropic of Cancer
and longitudinally from the Aleutian Islands in the west to the
Canadian maritime provinces in the east. The regional atmos-
pheric circulation is dominated by disturbances (waves) in the
upper-level westerly winds. The development of these waves
defines the position of the main upper-level jet stream over the
continent and thus the position of the so-called Polar Front at
the surface, which generally separates colder, drier air to the
north from warmer, moister air to the south. In the colder half
of the year, the position of the Polar Front can vary greatly, from
southern Canada to the southern reaches of the United States.
Such large shifts in the Polar Front are associated with long,
high-amplitude waves that often cause one part of the continent
to experience warm, moist, southerly airflow while another part
experiences a blast of dry and cold Arctic air (meridional flow).
These conditions may persist for lengthy periods because of the
typically slow movement of these longer waves. At other times,
however (mainly in the fall and spring), shorter, weaker waves
move more quickly across the continent—producing highly
variable weather with rapidly changing, but not extremely high
or low, temperatures and short wet and dry periods. In the sum-
mer, the Polar Front retreats well into Canada, for the most part,
and two oceanic semipermanent high-pressure systems tend to
dominate the North American weather; as a result, there typi-
cally are fewer and weaker synoptic-scale disturbances in the
westerlies, In summer and autumn, tropical storms of Atlantic,
Caribbean, or Gulf of Mexico origin occasionally impact the
Atlantic and Gulf coasts.

"mean rainfall (mainly convective in nature) typically exceeds

fueled by a strong low-level southerly jet stream bringing
abundant moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. The active con-
vection often begins in the spring and continues through the
summer, causing severe local- to regional-scale flooding. The
convective activity observed over the Midwest, the Great
Plains, and the southeastern United States also is responsible
for the fact that this part of the United States experiences more
severe weather (in the form of thunderstorms, tornadoes, and
hail) than any other part of the world. Although North
American annual precipitation is much more climatologically

of unpalatable and toxic substances, as well as decreases in min-

studies that low soil nitrogen—a common constraint on range-

limit plant growth responses to elevated CO, (Owensby et al.,

nitrogen poor or that increased CO, concentrations slow nitro-

(Diaz et al., 1993; Morgan et al., 1994; Gorissen et al., 1995).

"Since the turn of the century, mesic and arid grasslands in
North America have had increases in C3 woody plants
(Branson, 1985; IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 2). This change
often has been accompanied by changes in runoff, accelerated
Soil erosion, and loss of the grazing resource (Rauzi and Fly,
1968; Spaeth et al., 1996). Increases in CO, and changes in
regional climate could exacerbate the existing problem of loss
of production on western rangelands by accelerating the inva-
sion of woody plants. Mayeux ef al. (1991) discuss evidence
that C, grasslands are being increasingly invaded by C3, woody
plants—a process that may have been abetted by the rise in
CO, and changes in WUE over the past two centuries.

"On grasslands where the effects of increased WUE are not
negated by an increase in leaf temperature and leaf area, rising
CO, concentration should slow the depletion of soil water by
grasses and potentially favor shrubs/woody plants that other-
wise might succumb to water stress (Polley et al., 1997). There
is evidence that rising CO, also could contribute to species
change by altering seedling survival rates during drought.
Polley et al. (1996) found that more than twice as many honey
mesquite tree seedlings survived soil-water depletion at elevat-
ed CO, levels than at ambient CO, levels. In the absence of fire
or browsing, woody plants likewise would be expected to
increase in size and abundance by exploiting the greater avail-
ability of soil water (Polley, 1997). Grass production and tran-
spiration often decline following woody plant invasion
(Vallentyne, 1971; Scifres, 1980; Knoop and Walker, 1985;

"On improved pastures, the alteration of species composition
through reseeding with adapted grass species or the introduction
of legumes to grass-dominated pastures is the most likely
method to reduce the impacts of climate change. This approach
would have the additional benefit of improving forage value for
livestock while possibly reducing the average methane emis-
sion per head of livestock because of improved forage quality
(IPCC 1996, WG II, Chapter 2). For native rangelands, active
interventions to reduce impacts from increases in temperature
or CO, or changes in precipitation frequency and amount are
limited because of the large areal extent of rangelands and the
low economic return per acre of land. Introduction of nonnative
adapted species may be able to compensate for the loss of some
forage production and watershed protection if native species
decrease. However, the application and extent of this technolo-
gy on federal lands may be limited by existing rules, regulation,

the vegetation community in the arid southern region of North

at increased risk of wind and water erosion (Belnap, 1995;

may need to be developed to cope with climate change,
research that deals with annual and interannual fluctuations in

"Members (1995) considered climate change and doubled CO,
from computer simulations of three different biogeographic
models (see Annex C) and three different climate scenarios; a
general result was that grasslands would contract and move
eastward into the broadleaf forest and that shrublands would
decrease within the United States. Potentially large increases
(185%) in subtropical arid shrublands could occur in the south-
west region of North America. Depending on the model and
climate scenario, however, there could be a potential decrease
(-56%) in subtropical arid shrublands (VEMAP Members,
1995). The most recent projections from the MAPSS model
(Annex C) indicate up to a 200% increase in leaf area index in
the desert southwest region of North America and a northern
migration and expansion of arid-land species into the Great
Basin region of North America. Various combinations of vege-

"Asecond promising avenue of adaptation is to provide arid and
semi-arid land managers with more accurate predictions of
regional precipitation on a seasonal to interannual basis. This
information is particularly important prior to droughts or
extremely wet years. Provision of these types of predictions is
becoming more likely because recent research indicates that
improvements in coupled ocean-atmosphere models make it
possible to predict climatic conditions related to the El Nino-
Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon more than a year
before the event (Chen et al., 1995). Predicted precipitation
patterns can be used as inputs to ecological and hydrological
models and thereby could provide the capability to assess the
impacts of changing rainfall on flood frequency, surface
hydrology, soil erosion, and forage and crop production and
allow managers to develop mitigation plans to reduce degrada-
tion to rangeland ecosystems by altering grazing systems and
purchasing supplemental feed before the onset of droughts.

"The distribution of birds in Canada shows strong corre-
lation with habitat distribution, which in turn is influ-
enced by climate as well as human land-use practices.
Thus, changes in climate are expected to have signifi-
cant effects on breeding and winter distributions. A
combination of temperature and moisture considerations
is the best predictor of the beginning of the nesting
period, defining a “climate space” that can be extended
to describe the limits of the breeding range (James and
Shugart, 1974). In winter, the northern boundaries of
many species coincide with January isotherms, reflect-
ing daily energy requirements. For marine birds, shifts
in the distribution of water masses of different tempera-
ture and salinity characteristics—supporting different
species of prey—are expected to generate the most
obvious responses to changing climates (Brown, 1991).

birds, the timing of snowmelt is a critical variable that
drives the success of nesting, as well as its timing

the frequency or extent of extreme events may have a dispro-

Short-term variations in local or regional precipitation—upon
which management planning often is based—are greater than
the predicted change in the mean value of precipitation for
North America (Shuttleworth, 1996). With the addition of cli-
mate change to existing stresses on rangelands, they may
become more sensitive to extreme events such as drought, 100-

arid and semi-arid lands in North America (IPCC 1996, WG II,

"Catastrophic geomorphic processes in mountain terrain are

the decay of mountain permafrost during recent and projected

Water quality would be affected by increased sediment loads.
Fish and wildlife habitat, as well as roads and other structures,

"Three broad forest types are recognized in this assessment of
North American forests: boreal, temperate evergreen, and tem-
perate mixed forests. The boreal forest (Annex C, Figure C-1)
is constrained by cold temperatures to the north that limit tree
height and reproduction (Lenihan and Neilson, 1993; Starfield
and Chapin, 1996). The southern limits of the boreal forest
generally are defined by their juxtaposition with temperate
forests or with interior savanna-woodlands and grasslands.
Boreal tree species generally are not limited from growing fur-
ther south. Rather, temperate hardwoods and conifers are lim-
ited by cold temperatures from spreading further north; where
temperate species can flourish, they outcompete boreal species.
Fire and herbivore browsing also are important constraints on
forest distribution and species composition (Bergeron and
Dansereau, 1993; Landhauser and Wein, 1993; Suffling, 1995;
Starfield and Chapin, 1996). Wildfire and insect outbreaks
limit forest productivity and can produce considerable mortal-
ity: Annual tree mortality losses from insect outbreaks in
Canada are about 1.5 times the losses from wildfire and
amount to about one-third of the annual harvest volume
(Fleming and Volney, 1995). Annual losses from insects and
fire in the United States also are about one-third of the annual
harvest (Powell et al., 1993). Warming-induced changes in the
timing of spring frosts may be important in ending or prolong-
ing outbreaks. Increased drought stress also may enhance
insect outbreaks, and changes in climate could extend the

are unconstrained; that leaf conductance may not be reduced;
and that both responses depend on the experimental conditions,
the length of exposure, and the degree of nutrient or water
stress. These results imply that forests could produce more leaf
area under elevated CO, but may not gain a benefit from
increased WUE. In fact, with increased leaf area, transpiration
should increase on a per-tree basis, and the stand would use
more water (Eamus, 1996a). Elevated temperatures would

nitrogen budget (Komer, 1995). Increased leaf area production is

are critical climate factors, rendering these forests sensitive to
global warming (Franklin et al., 1991). Northwest conifers are
long lived and need only successfully reproduce once during
their life span for population sustainability (Stage and

in some areas; after harvest, some forests may not be able to
regenerate, even if mature trees could still survive the climate.
Winter chilling may be required for adequate seed set or to
confer frost-hardiness in some species (Burton and Cumming,
1995); because of the well-recognized spatial variation in the
genetics of these species, however, such chilling requirements
may not hold everywhere. Fire suppression in interior pine
forests has left them in a sensitive condition with respect to
drought, fire, and pests (Agee, 1990; Sedjo, 1991). Climate

geography models by simulating temporal dynamics of forests
at a point; they therefore are able to simulate forest decline,
dieback, or enhanced growth, as well as changes in species
composition. The different models showed either increases or
decreases in biomass depending on the method used for water

decline and dieback ranged only from 0-19% of the individual
forest areas (Table 8-3) when a direct CO, effect was included.
However, if the direct CO, effect is withheld under the newer

with a range of 12-89% of the forest area—with large range
contractions in all major forest zones. Results without a CO,
effect under the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR) sce-
narios are similar in magnitude to results with a CO, effect
under the FAR scenarios (Annex B). Because the full 2xCO,
effect may be less than fully realized, the potential forest
response is bounded by simulating forests with and without a
CO, effect. It is worth noting that by including sulfate aerosols
in one SAR scenario, warming over the temperate mixed for-

models indicate that forests could shift upward in elevation and
possibly disappear from some zones because of the lack of
winter cooling for forest regeneration, increased sensitivity to
spring frosts, and drought stress (Cumming and Burton, 1996).
Where simulated dieback occurs in any of the forest zones, it
tends to occur within a few decades of initial warming—with,
for example, a 30% reduction in biomass within 50 years in the
Douglas fir zone (Cumming and Burton, 1996).

projected under the FAR 2xCO, GCM scenarios (including a

effect. However, the projected forest-area increases under the
SAR scenarios are reduced to 21-24% when a direct physio-
logical CO, effect is not included. In the long term, more cat-

"Boreal forests displace most of the taiga/tundra region and
increase in area under the SAR scenarios but are projected to
increase or decrease under the FAR scenarios (Table 8-2). It
has been projected that the temperate evergreen forests shift
northward into Canada and Alaska and expand under the cli-
mate projected by the FAR scenarios (Annex C, Figures C-2 to
C-5; Table 8-2). Temperate evergreen forests may expand or
contract in area—due in part to conversion from conifers to
broadleaf deciduous forests and in part to severe forest dieback
under some scenarios (Annex C, Figures C-2 to C-5; Table 8-2;
VEMAP Members, 1995). The temperate mixed forest is pro-
jected to invade the boreal forest to the north and experience
gains in area under all simulations. Smaller gains in area of
both temperate forest types occur under more xeric scenarios;
forest expansions to the north are balanced by forest dieback in
the southern zones. Because dieback in the southern zones
might occur more rapidly than northward advances, there
could be a short-term reduction in the area of important tem-
perate and boreal forests (King and Neilson, 1992; Smith and
Shugart, 1993).

"Thus, two contrasting scenarios of the North American forest
future must be considered: one with considerable forest
dieback, another with much enhanced forest growth. These
contrasting scenarios represent endpoints on a spectrum of pos-
sible responses. In general, however, the enhanced-growth sce-
narios occur under the least amount of simulated global warm-
ing, whereas the severe decline or dieback scenarios occur
under the greatest projected global warming. With the incorpo-
ration of direct CO, effects, small temperature increases can
produce increased growth, but larger temperature increases still
produce declines. Without a direct CO) effect, forest decline
simulations are far more widespread, even under the least
warming scenarios. These results suggest the possibility that
early forest responses to global warming could exhibit
enhanced growth; later stages could produce widespread
decline or dieback. Most combinations of scenarios and CO,
effects produce intermediate scenarios, with a regional mosaic
of forest dieback and enhanced forest growth. When coupled
with economic models, these internally consistent but poten-
tially opposite regional responses provide the basis for region-
al, national, and globally integrated assessments. Also, it is not
clear that greenhouse gases will stabilize at the equivalent of
2xCO, forcing; they could increase to 3xCO, or 4xCO, (IPCC
1996, WG I, Section 2.1.3).

only 3% to slightly over half of the area) that undergo an
increase in forest biomass (Table 8-4). Under newer SAR sce-

become very sensitive to even small variations in drought
stress and are very susceptible to catastrophic fire, even with-
out global warming (Neilson et al., 1992; Stocks, 1993; Stocks

riencing increased frequencies of drought stress; pest infesta-
tions; and catastrophic, stand-replacing fires (Agee, 1990),
This sequence of events is a reasonable analog for what could
happen to forests over much larger areas in the zones project-

leaf area as a consequence of temperature-induced transpira-
tion increases and drought stress (Annex C, Figures C-6 to C-9;

river basins from northwestern Ontario to Alberta for changes
in the timing of peak spring runoff. In the sample, the more

the recent portion of data. These trends generally are consistent
with climate models that produce an enhanced hydrological

the result of water-management or land-use changes that

"Recent investigations have shown how natural modes of vari-
ability at scales from seasons to years (e.g., ENSO, Pacific
Decadal Oscillation) affect hydrological variability in different
regions of North America and thereby have underlined the
importance of increasing our understanding of the roles these
features play in influencing hydrological characteristics. The
ENSO phenomenon, a predictable climate signal, affects pre-
cipitation and streamflow in the northwestern, north-central,
northeastern, and Gulf coast regions of the United States
(Kahya and Dracup, 1993; Dracup and Kahya, 1994). For
example, La Nifia events (the cold phase of the ENSO phe-
nomenon) produce higher than normal precipitation in winter
in the northwestern United States, whereas El Nifio events (the
warm phase of the ENSO phenomenon) cause drier winters in
the Northwest on roughly a bidecadal time scale. Precipitation
over a large region of southern Canada extending from British
Columbia through the prairies and into the Great Lakes shows
a distinct pattern of negative precipitation anomalies during the
first winter following the onset of El Nifo events; positive
anomalies occur in this region with La Nina events. On the
other hand, the northern prairies and southeastern Northwest
Territories show significant positive precipitation anomalies
with El Nifo events (Shabbar et al., 1997). Variability in
ENSO phenomena contributes natural variations in hydrology
at decadal and longer time scales that are problematic for CO,
climate change analysis. Changes in ENSO behavior related to
increasing CO, are highly uncertain but could produce
enhanced variability in precipitation and streamflow for the
regions most sensitive to ENSO fluctuations (IPCC 1996, WG
I, Section 6.4.4).

regions in which changes in precipitation do not offset increas-

effects.) Seasonal changes in runoff also could be substantial.
Most climate change scenarios suggest increased winter precip-
itation over much of North America, which could result in
increased runoff and river flows in winter and spring. Several
climate change scenarios show declines in summer precipita-
tion in some regions (e.g., the southeastern United States; IPCC
1996, WG I, Figure 6.11) or declines in summer soil-moisture
levels (e.g., over much of North America; IPCC 1996, WG I,
Figure 6.12), which could result in significant declines in sum-
mer and autumn runoff in these regions. However, climate
change scenarios showing summer declines in precipitation or
soil-moisture levels in these regions generally are produced
from simulations with doubled CO, forcing alone; when aerosol
forcing is included, summer precipitation and soil-moisture lev-
els increase only slightly. This pattern highlights the large
uncertainty in climate change projections of runoff.

"Damages to structures, hydropower operations, and navigation
and flooding caused by !ate-winter and spring ice-jam events
are estimated to cost CAN$60 million annually in Canada and
US$100 million in the United States. About 35% of flooding in
Canada is caused by ice jams—principally in the Atlantic
Provinces, around the Great Lakes, in British Columbia, and in
northern regions (Beltaos, 1995). Northern deltas and wet-
lands, however, depend upon flooding for periodic recharge
and ecological sustainability (Prowse, 1997). The 2xCO, GCM
simulations (IPCC 1996, WG I, Summary for Policymakers)
suggest milder winters in higher latitudes and a general pattern
of increased precipitation, with high regional variability.
Where warmer winters result in reduced ice thickness, less
severe breakups and reduced ice-jam flooding can be expected.
However, major changes in precipitation patterns also are pre-
dicted. In some regions, there is an increased likelihood of win-
ter or early spring rains. These climatic factors trigger sudden
winter thaws and premature breakups that have the greatest
potential for damage. Thus, although average conditions may
be improved, the severity of extreme events in some regions
appears likely to increase. In the more southern latitudes com-
monly affected by spring ice jams—such as the lower Great
Lakes and central Great Plains areas, parts of New England,
Nova Scotia, and British Columbia—there may be a reduction
in the duration and thickness of the ice cover on rivers, as well
as in the severity of ice jamming. In the north, similar effects
are expected. In the intermediate latitudes—such as the
prairies; much of Ontario and Quebec; and parts of Maine,
New Brunswick, Newfoundland, and Labrador—spring jam-
ming may become more common and/or severe. Such events
are presently rare or completely unknown in some of these
areas (Van Der Vinne et al., 1991; Beltaos, 1995).

uncertain). In areas where climate change scenarios suggest that
precipitation or soil moisture levels could decline, lake levels are
likely to decline or to fluctuate more widely (IPCC 1996, WG II,
Section 10.5.2). Decreases in precipitation and/or soil moisture
are indicated for the southeastern United States and much of the
midcontinental region of North America in several 2xCO, GCM
simulations with only CO, forcing. Water-level declines would
be most severe in lakes and streams in dry evaporative drainage
basins and basins with small catchments. Semipermanent prairie
sloughs are fed by groundwater in addition to precipitation and
Spring snowmelt. Severe droughts deplete groundwater storage
and cause these sloughs to dry out—resulting in turn in a decline
of bird habitats (Poiani and Johnson, 1991, 1993). In the north-

instituted to reduce risk at a lower cost to society, but these
strategies require significant political will. Even with the high
frequency of extreme events that have occurred recently (and
their attendant costs), changes to less-costly and more effective
nonstructural methods of risk reduction are slow in gaining
acceptance. Navigation also might be impaired by changes in
hydrological variability, as illustrated by severe restrictions on
navigation in the Mississippi River during the drought of 1988

could be severely restricted during droughts. It is estimated that
hydropower production might decline 20% during the
peak-load summer months in northern California as a result of
more severe droughts (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 14.3.3).
More severe summer droughts also could increase agricultural

"The Great Lakes of North America are a critically important
resource, and potential climate change effects are of great
concern. Based on 2xCO, scenarios from several GCMs that
indicated seasonal temperature increases of 2.6-9.1°C and
seasonal precipitation changes of -30% to +40% (generally
summer/autumn declines and winter increases), the following
lake level declines could occur: Lake Superior -0.2 to -0.5 m,
Lakes Michigan and Huron -1.0 to -2.5 m, and Lake Erie -0.9
to -1.9 m; the regulation plan for Lake Ontario cannot meet the
minimum downstream flow requirements and maintain lake
levels (Croley, 1990; Hartmann, 1990; Mortsch and Quinn,
1996). Using the Canadian Climate Centre (CCC) GCM II sce-
nario (which generally has drier summer and autumn condi-
tions than other GCMs for this region), the surface area of Lake
St. Clair decreases by 15%; its volume is reduced by 37%; the
water level declines 1.6 m; and the shoreline may be displaced
1-6 km lakeward, exposing lake bottom (Lee et al., 1996).
These Great Lakes water-level changes are based on climate
change scenarios from models that produced global tempera-
ture increases that are at least twice as large and precipitation
changes that generally are greater than the most recent climate
change simulations with aerosols included. Nonetheless,
although highly uncertain at this time, the potential declines in
lake water levels shown in these analyses could have large
effects on wetlands, fish spawning, recreational boating, com-
mercial navigation, and municipal water supplies in the Great
Lakes area. Also of concern is the exposure of toxic sediments
and their remediation with declines in lake levels (Rhodes and

to result in acidification of streams due to oxidation of organ-

"Citrus production, for example, may shift slightly northward as
temperatures rise in southern states. Yields are predicted to
decline in southern Florida and Texas as a consequence of
higher-than-favorable temperatures during the winter
(Rosenzweig et al., 1996). Warmer temperatures experienced
at slightly more northern locations may lessen the chance of
freeze damage, but the overall risk of early- and late-season
frost will remain a major factor in crop loss. It is worth noting
that as a woody perennial, citrus offers little possibility of
short-term adaptation to climate change through management
because the timing of phenological events in citrus is not under
the control of the orchard manager. Other simulation studies
show that corn and soybean yields may decrease across much
of the U.S. corn belt with a 2°C rise in temperature (Phillips et

22% across sites from Maine to Washington as temperatures

will arise as a consequence of climate change, although the
impacts of these changes on agriculture will be modified by
trends in world food production and commodity exports. These
interactions can be modeled to estimate the economic conse-

Adams et al. (1995a,b) used three GCM scenarios to evaluate
the economic consequences to crop production and regional wel-
fare if climate changes of similar magnitude were to occur.
Figure 8-8 illustrates the subregional variability in economic
welfare suggested by climate change, including a CO, fertiliza-

GCM-based analyses to assess a wide range of potential tem-

combinations of alternative temperature and precipitation
changes (0°C, 1.5°C, 2.5°C, and 5°C for temperature and
-10%, 0%, +7%, and +15% for precipitation). In addition, the
analysis considered four alternative levels for atmospheric
CO, concentrations (355, 440, 530, and 600 ppm). This
scheme produced a total of 64 incremental scenarios, which
were evaluated for 1990 and 2060 conditions. These scenarios
represented the data set for estimation of a climate change
response function for 1990 and 2060 conditions of technologi-

uniform scenarios, the two GCM-based analyses used climate
forecasts from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS)

reached a similar conclusion and urged that future research into
agriculture and climatic change be reframed to explicitly con-

Although scientific controversy remains over the nature and
tate of climate change and the importance of climate variabili-
ty, most scenarios suggest gradual changes in mean tempera-
ture and precipitation over decades, providing opportunities for
farms and other parts of the sector to adapt. In addition, the
time scale of 80-100 years makes other profound social
changes inevitable. Income and population growth and techno-
logical innovation will accelerate or decelerate, depending on
global location, at the same time that adaptation to climate is

decisions to follow an adaptive strategy and subsequent adjust-

benefits of about US$80 million under a number of GCM pro-

to test the assumption of costless transitions across these fish-
eries. This analysis assumed that best-use cold-water fishery
losses caused by thermal changes were effectively lost recre-
ational services. Under this assumption, all scenarios resulted in

"Direct physiological effects, including metabolic
processes influenced by temperature, salinity, and oxy-
gen levels—Fish often seek optimal temperature or
salinity regimes or avoid suboptimal conditions. Thus,
ocean and freshwater changes as a result of projected
climate changes can lead to distributional changes. In
suboptimal conditions, performance is reduced, leading
to starvation or increased predation.
Diseases—Certain environmental conditions are
more conducive to diseases than others (e.g., warm
waters can trigger disease outbreaks; likewise, cold
temperatures can limit them).

Food—The environment affects feeding rates and
competition, as well as abundance, quality, size, tim-

"Climate is only one of several factors that regulate fish abun-
dance. Managers attempt to model abundance trends in relation
to fishing effects in order to sustain fisheries. In theory, a suc-
cessful model could account for global warming impacts along
with other impacts without understanding them. For many
species of fish, the natural mortality rate is an inverse function
of age: Longer-lived fish will be affected by natural changes
differently than shorter-lived fish. If the atmosphere-freshwater-
ocean regime is stable for a particular time, it is possible to
estimate the age-specific mortality rates for a species of inter-
est. However, at least some parts of the atmosphere-freshwater-
ocean system are prone to oscillations on a decadal scale,
which may not be cyclical. These natural changes occur glob-
ally; thus, they will have impacts on the freshwater and marine
ecosystems that support North American fish populations.
Under natural conditions, it may be expected that the different
life histories of these fish will result in different times of
adjustment to a new set of environmental conditions.

"In North America, freshwater fish have been grouped into three
broad thermal groups (cold-water, cool-water, and warm-water
guilds) based on differences in the temperature optima of phys-
iological and behavioral processes. In simulations of deep,
thermally stratified lakes in the mid- and high latitudes, includ-
ing the Laurentian Great Lakes, winter survival, growth rates,
and thermal habitat generally increase for fish in all three ther-
mal guilds under the 2xCO, climate (DeStasio et al., 1996;
IPCC 1996, WG II, Sections 10.6.1.2 and 10.6.3.2; Magnuson
and DeStasio, 1996). However, in smaller mid-latitude lakes,
particularly those that do not stratify or are more eutrophic,
warming may reduce habitat for many cool-water and cold-
water fish because deep-water thermal refuges are not present
or become unavailable as a consequence of declines in dis-
solved oxygen concentrations (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section
10.5.4). For example, Stefan et al. (1996) examined the effect
of temperature and dissolved oxygen changes in lakes in
Minnesota; they projected that under a 2xCO, climate (from a
GISS GCM that projected a 3.8°C air temperature increase in
northern Minnesota), cold-water fish species would be elimi-
nated from lakes in southern Minnesota, and cold-water habi-
tat would decline by 40% in lakes in northern Minnesota.

"Changes in the productivity and species composition of food
Tesources also may accompany climatic warming and, in turn,
influence fish productivity. Production rates of plankton and
benthic invertebrates increase logarithmically with tempera-
ture; rates increase generally by a factor of 2-4 with each 10°C
increase in water temperature, up to 30°C or more for many
organisms (Regier et al., 1990; Benke, 1993; IPCC 1996, WG
II, Section 10.6.1.1). Although this effect generally should
increase fish productivity, shifts in species composition of fish
prey with warming might prevent or reduce productivity gains.
Biogeographic distributions of aquatic insects are centered
around species thermal optima, and climate warming may alter
species composition by shifting these thermal optima north-
ward by about 160 km per 1°C increase in temperature
(Sweeney ef al., 1992; IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 10.6.3.1). If
species range shifts lag changes in thermal regimes because of
poor dispersal abilities or a lack of north-south migration
routes (e.g., rivers draining northward or southward) or if
Species adaptation is hindered by limited genetic variability,
climatic warming might result initially in reductions in the pre-
ferred prey organisms of some fish (IPCC 1996, WG II,
Section 10.6.3.3).

"(IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 10.5.4). Changes in lake mixing
properties may have large effects on hypolimnetic dissolved
oxygen concentrations (affecting available fish habitat) and on
epilimnetic primary productivity, although these effects are
likely to depend greatly on the morphometric characteristics
of individual lakes and are difficult to predict (IPCC 1996,
WG II, Section 10.5.4). For example, longer summer stratifi-
cation and higher water temperature result in more severe
hypolimnetic oxygen depletion in lakes in Minnesota under a
2xCO, climate simulation (Stefan et al., 1993). In other lakes,
reduction in the duration or lack of winter ice cover might
reduce the likelihood of winter anoxia (IPCC 1996, WG II,
Section 10.6.1.4). At high latitudes, development of summer
stratification under a warmer climate might increase lake pri-
mary productivity by maintaining algae for longer periods
within the euphotic zone. Climate changes that result in
decline in runoff also may have substantial effects on the mix-
ing properties of smaller lakes that are heavily influenced by
fluxes of chemicals from their catchments. For example, the
surface mixed layer of boreal lakes at the Experimental Lakes
Area in northwest Ontario has deepened over the past 20 years
as a result of a long-term drought that reduced inputs of DOC
from the catchment and thus increased water clarity (IPCC

"In many areas, increases in flow variability are likely to pro-
duce larger effects on biota than changes in mean flows (IPCC
1996, WG II, Section 10.6.2.1), which could result in some
changes in ecosystem productivity and organism abundance
(including positive and negative effects). In arid-land streams,
more intense storms and longer periods of drought may pro-
duce severe streambank erosion, lower biomass and productiy-
ity, and a decline in biological interactions (IPCC 1996, WG II,
Box 10-3). In humid regions, more intense or clustered storms
could reduce the abundance of many stream organisms via
scouring of streambeds, although greater frequency of flood-
plain flooding also might increase the productivity of many
river and stream organisms. Longer periods of drought in
humid regions, particularly in summer, could increase the
probability that streams will cease flowing and become dry;
reductions in annual runoff also could increase the probability
that streams will dry. In a regional analysis of U.S. streams,
Poff (1992) projected that nearly one-half of perennial runoff
streams in the eastern United States may become intermittent
with only a 10% decline in annual runoff. Even if streams do
not become intermittent, longer droughts and lower summer

of fish or shellfish are suitable, as well as the expansion or con-
traction of suitable aquaculture sites. General warming may allow
aquaculture sites to expand into regions previously unavailable
because water temperatures were too cold or there was a presence
of sea ice. Growth rates of fish or shellfish and their food require-
ments are temperature dependent. Aquaculturists also are inter-
ested in projections of wind mixing, which contributes to flush-
ing (i.e., the exchange of water between the aquaculture site and
surrounding waters). Low flushing can lead to decreased oxygen;
greater potential for the spread of diseases; and, in the case of fil-
ter feeders such as mussels, reduced food availability.

"In the south, warmer river water and reduced flows in late sum-
mer may increase mortalities and reduce spawning success.
Warmer waters in the winter will accelerate incubation and
hatching and cause alevins to enter lakes earlier. Henderson et
al. (1992) concluded that warming of sockeye rearing lakes
would lower plankton production and reduce the size of smolts
going to sea. These smaller smolts also may encounter reduced
food when they enter the ocean, and the resulting slower
growth may expose juveniles to predation longer and increase
mortality in the early marine period. Welch et al. (1995) pro-
posed that global warming would increase winter temperatures
sufficiently that sockeye juveniles would migrate out of the
northern Pacific into the Bering Sea, effectively reducing the
winter feeding area. It is known that there are large interannu-
al fluctuations in survival (Burgner, 1991) and large, natural,
decadal shifts in marine survival (Hare and Francis, 1995;
Adkison et al., 1996; Beamish et al., 1997). The mechanisms
involved are not understood, but the shifts in abundance clear-
ly show that changes in the ocean environment have profound
impacts on the productivity of the stocks.

provide important habitat and nourishment for a large number

(Kaye and Barghoorn, 1964). As a result, the area of dry land
just above wetlands is less than the area of wetlands. If sea level

seals and sea lions) have life histories that tie them to specific
geographic features (e.g., pupping beaches or icefields).
Although there is some flexibility in their need for specific

"The implications of rising sea level are well understood, in part
because sea level has been rising relative to the land along
most of the coast of North America (and falling in a few areas)
for thousands of years. For the most part, the relative rise and
fall of sea level has been caused by adjustments of the earth’s
crust to the glacial mass that was removed from the land sur-
faces after the end of the last ice age (Grant, 1975). Change in
the volume of water in oceans was also of importance. Water
locked up in ice caps during ice ages lowered the volume of
water in oceans, thus lowering sea level. The changes dis-
cussed here have occurred over geologic time (Holocene
Epoch—last 10,000 years). The land is rising (i.e., relative sea
level is falling) in the northern areas that had been covered by
the ice sheet; land is subsiding in nearby areas that were not
covered by the glaciers, such as the Canadian maritime
provinces and U.S. middle Atlantic states.

beaches usually are less than 5 m wide (Nordstrum, 1992),
even a S-cm rise in sea level can eliminate these systems in
areas where adjacent land is protected with structures.
Moreover, the environmental regulations that protect wetlands

wetlands to rising sea level. In many areas, development will
prevent the wetland creation that otherwise would result from
the gradual inundation of areas that are barely above today’s

Mississippi delta otherwise could keep pace with rising relative

wetlands, even if no additional bulkheads or dikes are erected to
prevent new wetland creation. Table 8-6 presents estimated
losses in U.S. wetlands by region. Similar comprehensive
assessments are unavailable for Canada. Nevertheless, regional
studies suggest that the most vulnerable area is likely to be the
salt marsh coast of the Bay of Fundy. Because 85% of these
wetlands are enclosed by a system of dikes, the risk is not so
much the direct submergence by higher water levels but rather
the possibility that unless the dikes are fortified, an increased
storm surge could overtop and breach the dikes. Many of the
wetlands around San Francisco are similarly vulnerable.

coastal areas to flooding both because higher sea level raises
the flood level from a storm of a given severity and because

"Figure 8-9: Responses to sea-level rise on developed barrier islands.
Lightly developed islands may have no practical choice other than the
“no protection” option, which would result in ocean-side erosion and in
some cases bayside inundation. Under the “engineered retreat” option,
a community might tolerate ocean-side erosion but move threatened
structures to newly created bayside lands, imitating the natural over-
wash process that occurs with narrow undeveloped islands. A more
common response is likely to be to raise entire islands as well as their
beaches; although the sand costs are much higher than with an engi-
neered retreat, existing land uses can be preserved. Finally, wide urban-
ized islands may choose to erect seawalls and levees (dikes); the loss
of beach access and waterfront views, however, make this option less
feasible for recreational barrier island resorts.

1980 heat wave that resulted in 1,700 heat-related deaths, heat
waves in 1983 and 1988 in the United States killed 566 and
454 people, respectively (CDC, 1995). More recently, in July
1995, a heat wave caused as many as 765 heat-related deaths
in the Chicago area alone (Phelps, 1996). Tavares (1996)

may reduce the predicted heat-related morbidity and mortality.
Kalkstein et al. (1993) found that people in Montreal and
Toronto might acclimatize somewhat to global warming condi-

potential acclimatization. It is important to note that acclimati-

"Death rates in temperate and subtropical zones appear to be
higher in winter than in summer (Kilbourne, 1992).
Comparative analyses of the causes of differences between
summer versus winter weather-related mortalities are lacking,
however. The United States averaged 367 deaths per year due
to cold in the period 1979-94 (Parrish, 1997), whereas the
annual average number of Canadians dying of excessive cold
is 110 (Phillips, 1990). It has been suggested that winter mor-
tality rates, which appear to be more related to infectious dis-
eases than to extremely cold temperatures, will be little impact-

in heat-related mortality, therefore, are unlikely to be of simi-

Increased building-shell efficiency and changes to building

are not implemented without costs (Loveland and Brown,
1990). Reducing the size of space-heating capacity in
response to warmer climate would be a logical adaptive
response in more temperate and polar countries and may free
up investment funds for other purposes, even within the ener-

adverse impacts on human health. These impacts would arise
by direct pathways (e.g., exposure to thermal stress and
extreme weather events) and indirect pathways (increases in
some air pollutants, pollens, and mold spores; malnutrition;
increases in the potential transmission of vector-borne and
waterborne diseases; and general public health infrastructural
damage) (IPCC 1996, WG II Sections 18.2 and 18.3, and
Figure 18-1). Climate change also could jeopardize access to
traditional foods garnered from land and water (such as game,
wild birds, fish, and berries), leading to diet-related problems
such as obesity, cardiovascular disorders, and diabetes among
northern populations of indigenous peoples as they make new
food choices (Government of Canada, 1996).

"Temperate regions such as North America are expected to
warm disproportionately more than tropical and subtropical
zones (IPCC 1996, WG I). The frequency of very hot days in
temperate climates is expected to approximately double for

(CDC, 1989; Climate Change Impacts Review Group, 1991).
Heat waves cause excess deaths (Kilbourne, 1992), many of
which are caused by increased demand on the cardiovascular
system required for physiological cooling. Heat also aggra-

particularly the elderly, the young, and the chronically ill

example, mortality during oppressively hot weather is asso-

implications of climate change on air quality or population
exposures to high concentrations of ground-level ozone. This
limitation is related to difficulty in devising a defensible sce-

"Air conditioning and adequate warning systems also may
reduce heat-related morbidity and mortality in a warmer North

reduce heat-related deaths by 25% (Phelps, 1996). A warning
system such as the Philadelphia Hot Weather-Health
Watch/Warning System (PWWS) that alerts the public when
oppressive air masses (e.g., extended periods of extreme high
temperatures, high humidity, moderate to strong southwesterly
winds, and high pressure) may occur might further reduce heat-
related mortality (Kalkstein and Smoyer, 1993), The PWWS is
a three-tiered system that produces a health watch, health alert,

past 10-20 years—teaching a peak in 1988, when 112 million
people lived in areas with higher than acceptable concentrations.
In addition, recent studies (U.S. EPA, 1996) provide evidence of
a positive correlation between ground-level ozone and respirato-

States. Such hospital admissions in the province of Ontario
strongly relate to ambient levels of sulfur dioxide and ozone and
to temperature (Canadian Public Health Association, 1992).

the large increase in ozone concentrations at ground level in
1988 in the United States and in parts of southern Canada can
be attributed, in part, to meteorological conditions; 1988 was
the third-hottest summer in the past 100 years. In general, the
aforementioned studies suggest a nonlinear relationship
between temperature and ozone concentrations at ground level:
Below temperatures of 22-26°C (70-80°F), there is no rela-
tionship between ozone concentrations and temperature; above
32°C (90°F), there is a strong positive relationship.

adverse health effects associated with social and environmental

exceptionally hot and humid weather, which reduced the devel-

currently are the leading cause of weather-related mortality. In
addition to causing deaths by drowning, flooding can lead to
widespread destruction of food supplies and outbreaks of dis-

also may result in the release of dangerous chemicals from
storage sites and waste disposal sites into floodwaters.
Increased runoff from agricultural lands during periods of

duration, and rate of change of temperature and moisture
regimes (Mount et al., 1993; Glass et al., 1994). The relation-
ships between vector life-stage parameters and climatic condi-

the distribution of these diseases in both the United States and

"Zooplankton, which feed on algae, can serve as reservoirs for
Vibrio cholerae and other enteric pathogens, particularly gram-
negative rods. Quiescent forms of V. cholerae have been found
to persist within algae; these quiescent forms can revert to a cul-
turable (and likely infectious) state when nutrients, pH, and
temperature permit (Huq et al., 1990). V. cholerae occur in the
Gulf of Mexico and along the east coast of North America. With
warmer sea surface temperatures, coastal algal blooms therefore
could facilitate cholera proliferation and transmission.

"It is also recognized—but poorly understood because of limited
research—that climate change may have some benefits (e.g,, it
may reduce stress or provide opportunities) for certain areas or
sectors within North America (e.g., expanded agriculture,
reduced heating costs) or have a neutral effect on climate-insen-
sitive sectors. If one examines any one particular climate impact,
it is likely that there will be “winners” and “losers” either across
subregions or within a subregion (e.g., across demographic
groups). Nevertheless, the weight of evidence suggests that
when all potential impacts are considered collectively, every
subregion will incur some negative impacts of climate change.
"	Text
"All of the potential impacts of climate change exhibit a region-
al texture. Variations in the regional distribution of impacts
need to be clearly articulated for policymakers. Failure to do so
can lead to misleading impressions about the potential changes
in social welfare as a result of climate change and alternative
policy responses. A simple look at aggregate impacts on U.S.
agriculture, for example, might suggest that climate change is
not likely to harm agriculture enough to significantly affect the
overall U.S. economy; policymakers might be left with the
erroneous impression that no policy-relevant problems exist.
Distributional differences emerge, however, upon examination
of the regional texture of agricultural impacts.
"	Text
"Different adaptation strategies and options will be necessary to
deal with these regional and sectoral differences. In areas
where production significantly increases—such as the northern
edge of agricultural production in North America—additional
adaptation may be necessary in the development of infrastruc-
ture to support expanded population and transportation require-
ments associated with growth. The texture of the distribution of
sectors and their biological, physical, and social components
across the North American landscape cannot adequately be
captured at a fine enough scale to be relevant to long-range
planning at the present time; these are essential elements of
future assessment needs.

"Marine: Warm water favors the growth of toxic organisms such
as red tides, which cause paralytic shellfish poisoning, diarrhe-
ic shellfish poisoning, and amnesic shellfish poisoning. For
example, one species of toxic algae previously confined to the
Gulf of Mexico (Gymnodinium breve) extended northward in
1987 after a “parcel of warm Gulf Stream water” reached far up
the east coast, resulting in human neurologic shellfish poison-
ings and substantial fish kills (Tester, 1991). Domoic acid, a
toxin produced by Nitzchia pungens diatom that causes amnesic
shellfish poisioning, appeared on Prince Edward Island for the
first time in 1987. The outbreak coincided with an El Nino year,
when warm eddies of the Gulf Stream neared the shore and
heavy rains increased nutrient-rich runoff (Hallegraeff, 1993).

Available water supplies will be directly affected by climate
change, but they also are affected by changes in demand from
the many sectors that rely upon the water. Water is a scarce
resource used in the agriculture, forest, and energy sectors. It is
used in urban areas and in recreational activities. It also is
essential for the survival of wetlands, nonforest ecosystems,
wildlife, and other ecological systems.

tices. These costs must be carefully weighed when considering
the tradeoffs among adapting to the change, reducing the cause of
the change, and living with the residual impacts. Second, the eco-
nomic and social costs of adaptation will increase the more rapid-
ly climate change occurs. Third, although many opportunities
exist for technological and behavioral adaptation, uncertainties
exist about potential barriers and limitations to their implementa-
tion. Fourth, uncertainties exist about the efficacy and possible
secondary effects of particular adaptive strategies.
"	Text
"Most existing studies of potential impacts have focused on the
more narrow direct pathway between climate change and cli-
mate-sensitive systems and sectors. These effects include direct
climate impacts on human health (e.g., heat stress), environ-
mental processes (¢.g., impacts of runoff and streamflow on the
hydrological cycle, coastal damages caused by sea-level rise,
changes in biodiversity), market activities that are linked to the
environment (e.g., agriculture, commercial timber, waterborne
transport), and human behavior (e.g., changes in air condition-
ing use as a result of changes in the frequency of very hot days).
"	Text
"Assessments of the potential impacts of climate change and vari-
ability on any of these systems and sectors must account for the
inherent competition for water supplies and the need for water of
varying qualities in various activities. For example, in an assess-
ment of the potential impacts of climate change on agriculture,
an assumption that farmers will be able to adapt to changing cli-
matic conditions through a reliance on irrigation is valid only to
the extent that water is available under future climate scenarios.
In many cases, the scarcity of available water supplies will
increase because of the direct effects of climate change on water,
as well as increased demands for available water supplies.

"In evaluating the implications of climate change impacts on
North America, one must consider that although there are
regional differences in response by sector and by subregion,
the scale of anticipated changes is such that there may be
adjustments taking place in every sector and subregion simul-
taneously. Any one of the impacts (whether beneficial or detri-
mental) that has been discussed for North America may appear
well within the capability of existing structures and policies to
adapt. However, the fact that they are occurring simultaneous-
ly may pose a significant challenge to resource managers and
policymakers. The systemic nature of impacts and issues rais-
es important questions about society’s ability to manage the
aggregate/cumulative risks posed by climate change.

"Acomplete assessment of the effects of climate change on North
America must include a consideration of the potential interac-
tions and feedbacks between sectors and subregions. Changes in
the climate system can affect natural and human systems in a
chain of consequences (see Figure 8-12). Some of these conse-
quences are the results of direct effects of climate change and
variability on physical, biological, and socioeconomic systems;
some result from indirect links between climate-sensitive sys-
tems and related social and economic activities; some result
from feedbacks between human activities that affect the climate
system, which in turn can lead to further impacts (e.g., human
activities affecting the climate system—which, in turn, can lead
to further impacts on human health, the environment, and

Canada (supported by Environment Canada and other sponsors) to assess the potential impacts of climate change scenar-

goal programming and an analytic hierarchy process. MBIS researchers identified six main policy issues related to cli-
mate change as another form of “vertical integration”: interjurisdictional water management, sustainability of native
lifestyles, economic development opportunities, buildings, transportation and infrastructure, and sustainability of ecosys-
tems (Cohen, 1997a). Integration also was attempted through information exchange (scenarios and data) while study
components were in progress and a series of workshops that provided opportunities for scientists and stakeholders to
express their views on how climate change might affect the region and to react to research results (Cohen, 1997a,b).

some parts of the region, especially at the southern boundaries
of fish species’ habitat regions. The loss of fishing opportuni-

"As this chain of consequences illustrates, the task of assessing
various impacts and the feedbacks among them is enormously
complex and requires a number of simplifying assumptions.
Although there are complex macroeconomic models to assess the
costs and consequences of various mitigation policies, the state of
the art in impact work at present limits the insights that can be
gained from this kind of “top-down” modeling. The dominant
approach has been “bottom-up”—aggregating direct and indirect
impacts into a single overall estimate, without much attention to
feedbacks among various sectors. Nevertheless, the complex,
integrated nature of the climate change problem suggests the
need for integrated assessments that incorporate many aspects of
the region. Sectoral assessments alone would not be sufficient.

"The Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Basin (GLSLB) Project on “adapting to the impacts of climate change and variability” is
a binational project initiated in 1992 by Environment Canada to improve our understanding of the complex interactions
among climate, environment, and society so that regional adaptation strategies could be developed in response to poten-
tial climate change and variability (Mortsch and Mills, 1996). The GLSLB Project identified four climate-sensitive
theme areas upon which to focus the research: water use and management, land use and management, ecosystem health,
and human health. Another prime focus of the GLSLB Project is adaptation, which provides the conceptual framework
for integrating research efforts. GLSLB Project studies contain common components that will facilitate the integration of
research findings, including study objectives; policy issue foci; a multidisciplinary approach; scenarios tested; impact
and adaptation assessment methods; the concept of adaptation; and scales of time, space, and human activity (Mortsch
and Mills, 1996). A number of more pragmatic integration concepts also have been incorporated into the GLSLB Project,
including the use of “end-to-end studies” assessing biophysical and socioeconomic impacts and developing and evaluat-
ing potential adaptation strategies, economic modeling (LINK model), the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS),
and common communication goals (Mortsch and Mills, 1996).

"Caribbean islands experienced an increase in mean annual
temperature of more than 0.5°C during the period 1900-1995.
During the same period, mean annual total rainfall decreased
by about 250 mm, though throughout the rainfall record has
been characterized by large variability. In the Pacific islands,
the increase in average annual temperature has been less than
0.5°C since 1900. Rainfall records for the Pacific (1900-1995)
reveal no clear trend; they show decadal fluctuations of +200
mm for mean annual rainfall and 50-100 mm for seasonal
rainfall.
"	Text
"The ocean exerts a strong influence on small islands. Island
climate is moderated by the maritime influence—which,
given the islands’ mainly tropical location, results in uni-
formly high temperatures (20°C and above) throughout the
year. However, other climate variables often exhibit distinct
seasonal patterns—particularly rainfall distribution, which
results in wet and dry seasons. Some small island states are
subject to tropical cyclones (i.e., hurricanes or typhoons);
those that are outside the main storm tracks also are affected
by high seas and swells associated with such events. In the
Pacific, large interannual rainfall variations resulting from
the El Nifo-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon are an
important climate characteristic; ENSO effects also are felt
on islands in the Caribbean Sea and Indian Ocean.
"	Text
"All of the small island states considered in this report are
located within the tropics, with the exception of Malta and
Cyprus in the Mediterranean. About one-third of the states
comprise a single main island; the others are made up of
several or many islands. Although some states are experi-
encing relative declines in sea level, others—primarily low-
lying island states and atolls—are especially vulnerable to
climate change and associated sea-level rise because, in
many cases (e.g., The Bahamas, Kiribati, Maldives,
Marshall Islands), much of the land area is only 3-4 m
above the present mean sea level. Islands at higher eleva-
tions also are vulnerable—particularly in coastal zones,
where settlements, economic infrastructure, and vital ser-
vices tend to be concentrated.
"	Text
"Economic activities in small island states frequently are domi-
nated by agriculture (e.g., sugar and bananas for export; sub-
sistence farming for local consumption) and by tourism, both
of which are sensitive to external forces and are strongly influ-
enced by climatic factors. Fisheries, although largely artisanal,
also support an important economic activity. Although total
population numbers are low, settlements commonly are con-
centrated in the capital city or on the capital island, where pop-
ulation densities often are very high. Human demands on
coastal and marine resources are continuing to increase; the
potential impacts of climate change, added to these pressures,
almost certainly will result in the degradation or loss of some
natural ecosystems that are important to the economies of
Small island states.
"	Text
"At this stage, there is much uncertainty in climate model
projections with respect to possible changes in the distribu-
tion, frequency, and intensity of tropical cyclones and
ENSO events. The most significant climate-related projec-
tion for small islands is sea-level rise. Current estimates of
future global sea-level rise of 5 mm/yr (with a range of 2-9
mm/yr) represent a rate that is 2 to 4 times higher than what
has been experienced globally over the past 100 years.
Considerable local and regional variations in the rate, mag-
nitude, and direction of sea-level change can be expected as
a result of thermal expansion, tectonic movements, and
changes in ocean circulation. However, although the level
of vulnerability will vary from island to island, it is expect-
ed that practically all small island states will be adversely
affected by sea-level rise.
"	Text
"Because simulations using ocean-atmosphere general circula-
tion models (GCMs) are not presently conducted at fine hori-
zontal resolution, the ability to generate climate change sce-
narios for the small island states is somewhat limited.
However, because of the strong influence of the surrounding
oceans on the climate of these islands and because the oceans
are projected to warm in the future [1-2°C for the Caribbean
Sea and the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, with a dou-
bling of carbon dioxide (CO,)], small islands also are expect-
ed to experience moderate warming in the future. Mean rain-
fall intensity also is projected to increase by about 20-30%
over the tropical oceans (the main locations of the small island
states) with doubled CO}. On the other hand, simulations con-
ducted with combined greenhouse gas (GHG) and aerosol
forcings project a decrease in mean summer precipitation over
the Mediterranean Sea region (the location of Malta and
Cyprus).

"Some ecosystems already are seriously affected by anthro-
pogenic stresses—which, in some islands, may pose as great a
threat as climate change itself. Where this situation exists, the
natural capacity of ecosystems to adapt to the effects of climate
change will be substantially reduced.
"	Text
"In many small island states, the largest settlements, much crit-
ical infrastructure, and major economic activities and services
are located close to present sea level and therefore will be at
tisk from sea-level rise. Vulnerability assessment studies have
shown that the costs of shoreline and other infrastructure pro-
tection could be burdensome for some islands.
"	Text
"The natural capacity of mangroves to adapt and migrate land-
ward in response to projected sea-level rise is expected to be
reduced by associated land loss, land-use practices, and the
presence of infrastructure in the coastal zone. Survival of man-
groves appears likely where the rate of sedimentation approxi-
mates the local rise in sea level, but landward migration com-
monly is inhibited by topography and infrastructure, which
will constrict the mangrove belt.
"	Text
"Many islands are likely to experience increased coastal ero-
sion and land loss as a consequence of sea-level rise. Beaches
are expected to be affected by a reduced supply of sediment
from adjacent reefs; on high islands, however, increased sedi-
ment yields from stream catchments may compensate for this
effect, at least in the short term. In addition, increased sea
flooding and inundation (as have been projected for the
Marshall Islands and Kiribati) are expected in most low-lying
islands and atolls.
"	Text
"Numerous adaptation measures for responding to climate
change and sea-level rise theoretically are available to small
island states; given their small size and limited human and
financial resources, however, the costs of adaptation often are
prohibitive. Shore protection, for instance, is very expensive—
and in the past, the design of structures has not always been
appropriate for the coastal environments of tropical small
islands. The use of more flexible, easily replaceable, tradition-
al shore protection measures could be explored, particularly in
island states of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Moreover, in
planning for adaptation, efforts should be made to maximize
the use of traditional knowledge and skills because island peo-
ples have had to cope with a variety of environmental stresses
in the past.
"	Text
"The impact of a climate change-related increase in air tem-
perature on small island states has not been investigated in
any detail. A rise in temperature (of the magnitude projected)
is not anticipated to have widespread adverse consequences,
though some critical ecosystems (e.g., coral reefs) are highly
sensitive to temperature changes. Although reefs have the
potential to keep up or catch up with the projected rate of sea-
level rise, in many parts of the tropics (e.g., the Caribbean
Sea, the Pacific Ocean) some species of corals live near their
limits of tolerance to temperature (about 25-29°C). Thus,
even relatively small projected increases in sea-surface tem-
perature could have an adverse impact on the viability of
some of these organisms. An increase in the incidence of
bleaching—associated with the elevation of water tempera-
tures above seasonal maxima—similarly would pose a threat
to coral reef ecosystems.
"	Text
"Proper evaluation of the overall risk of island states to project-
ed climate change effects requires adoption of a fully integrated
approach to vulnerability assessments. The sensitivity of small
islands to climate change cannot be attributed to any single fac-
tor (e.g., size or elevation); the cumulative and synergistic result
of these and related biophysical attributes, combined with their
economic and sociocultural character, ultimately determines the
vulnerability of these islands. Moreover, some islands are prone
to periodic non-climate-related hazards (e.g., earthquakes, vol-
canic eruptions, tsunamis); the degree of vulnerability of such
islands to climate change therefore should not be evaluated in
isolation from these threats. In addition, vulnerability assess-
ments for small island states should take into consideration the
value of nonmarketed goods and services (e.g., subsistence
assets, community structure, traditional skills and knowledge),
which also may be at risk. In some island societies, these assets
are just as important as marketed goods and services.
"	Text
"Tourism is the dominant economic sector in many small island
states in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific and Indian Oceans,
This sector is the single largest contributor to gross national
product (GNP) in many countries. In 1995, for example,
tourism accounted for 69%, 53%, and 50% of GNP in Antigua,
the Bahamas, and the Maldives, respectively. The tourism sec-
tor also earns considerable foreign exchange for a number of
small island states, many of which depend heavily on import-
ed food, fuel, and a range of other goods and services. For
example, in 1995, the tourist industry in the Maldives earned
US$181 million in foreign exchange—amounting to more than
70% of the country’s total foreign exchange earnings for that
year. In the Bahamas, the industry earned US$1.3 billion in for-
eign exchange in 1995, which was equivalent to more than
50% of government revenues for the year. Climate change and
sea-level rise would affect tourism directly and indirectly. The
loss of beaches to erosion and inundation, increasing stress on
coastal ecosystems, damage to infrastructure, and an overall
loss of amenities would jeopardize the viability of the tourist
industry in many small islands.

"Uncertainties in climate change projections are likely to be a
disincentive for implementing various adaptive measures,
especially because some options may be costly or require
changes in societal norms and behavior. For example, efforts to

"On low-lying islands and atolls where sea-level rise is project-
ed to be a threat, retreat away from the coast rarely is an option,
given the limited physical size of many islands. As a result,
migration and resettlement outside national boundaries may
have to be considered in extreme cases.
"	Text
"enhance the health and resilience of natural ecosystems—
including coral reefs, mangroves, and beaches—by reducing
activities that increase their vulnerability would be a vital
adaptation strategy, but there would be monetary and social
costs associated with their implementation. However, policies
that seek to incorporate sound principles of integrated coastal
management would be beneficial to the small island states in
the long term—even in the absence of projected climate
change and sea-level rise.

"Although these islands are by no means homogeneous politi-
cally, socially, or culturally—or in terms of physical size or
stage of economic development—many tend to share a number

land areas and high population densities, and large exclusive
economic zones (EEZs) (for mid-Pacific states, these zones are
1,000 times larger than the land area); they are located predom-

"To the extent that island species are restricted in range and dis-
tribution, they are potentially more endangered and prone to
extinction than the flora and fauna of continental land masses.
Communities of terrestrial fauna on small islands are poorly

fauna are dominated mainly by migratory sea birds, with a rel-
atively small number of indigenous species (Table D-7), repre-

most islands generally are moderated by the maritime influence,
with lower maximum and higher minimum temperatures than
continental land masses at the same latitude. Most islands also
have distinct seasonal patterns of rainfall and temperature.
Although many islands are located outside the normal tropical
storm tracks, some states in the Pacific and Indian Oceans and
the Caribbean Sea periodically are subject to the devastating
inflences of tropical cyclones (i.e., hurricanes and typhoons).

"The economies of small island states are sensitive to external
market forces over which they have little control. The
economies generally are dominated by agriculture, fisheries,
tourism, and international transport activities (air and sea). On
some islands, remittances from expatriate nationals are an
important component of family income. In the case of Tuvalu,
remittances mainly from workers in the phosphate mines in
Nauru, seamen, and contract workers in New Zealand exceed
by far export earnings (SPREP, 1996). Primary production also
is an important source of export earnings for many islands;

"The ecology of small islands generally is characterized by a
limited range of terrestrial and coastal ecosystems, surrounded
by a vast expanse of ocean. Vegetation usually consists of
groups of easily dispersed species, which have a tendency to be
restricted in their distribution. Forests (including strands and
mangroves), coral reefs, and sea grass communities provide a
range of food and other resources. Biodiversity is highly vari-
able and depends on a combination of physical and other fac-
tors (e.g., location, area, geology). For example, because of the
coralline nature of most low-lying atolls, soils usually are poor-
ly developed, exhibit immature profiles, are highly alkaline
and usually deficient in nutrients, and have low water-retention
capacity.

"Small island states may comprise a single island (e.g,,
Barbados, Malta, and Nauru); a few islands, such as Tuvalu (9
islands), Vanuatu (12), and Cape Verde (15); or numerous
islands—for instance, the Seychelles (115), Tonga (180), and
the Maldives (1,200). Physiographically and geologically,
island states may comprise low oceanic islands, including
atolls and reef islands; high volcanic or limestone islands; or
continental islands (Nunn, 1994). In the first group of islands,
species diversity and endemism often are low. In the second
group, species diversity may be high or low, but endemism
usually is high. Continental islands—particularly those located
on the broad shelves of neighboring land masses—tend to have
high species diversity and low endemism, which are functions
of their continental proximity.

"The majority of the world’s small island states are concentrat-
ed in four tropical regions: the tropical Pacific Ocean, Indian
Ocean, and Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean off the coast
of west Africa. A few small islands are found outside these
areas—for example, Malta and Cyprus, which are located in
the Mediterranean Sea. This chapter principally addresses
independent small island states; it does not focus on islands
that are more appropriately considered to be part of another
region (e.g., Singapore in Tropical Asia, Bahrain in the Middle
East); the many islands that constitute part of a larger country
(e.g., the thousands of small islands of Indonesia); or those that
are administered by a metropolitan country, such as the United
Kingdom, the United States, France, or The Netherlands.
Nevertheless, many of the climate change projections and
impacts detailed in this chapter apply equally to these other
types of islands.

temporally and spatially, over the past 100 years, and long-term

since 1975; conditions have been drier in Fiji, Tonga, and Western

the ENSO phenomenon (Salinger et a/., 1995), although the pre-

cipitation in terms of absolute amounts as well as spatial and
temporal distribution. Similarly, island systems would be
extremely vulnerable to any changes in the frequency or inten-
sity of extreme events (e.g., droughts, floods, hurricanes, and
storm surges). Indeed, vulnerability to these and other natural
hazards—including some that may not be influenced by climate
change (e.g., tsunamis, voleanoes)—contributes to the cumula-

"Further details of climate trends for the southwest Pacific region
have been reported by Hay et al. (1993a,b) and Salinger et al.
(1995); several subregions with coherent trends and variability
were identified. These studies indicate that the region as a
whole has warmed at a rate of about 0.2°C per decade and that
the 1981-1990 decade was the warmest on record. Within the
region, there has been a steady increase in temperature to the
south of the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ)—an area
that includes Fiji and Tonga—since the 1880s. A rapid increase
has occurred north of the SPCZ since the 1970s, after an earli-

"Some low-lying small island states—such as the atoll nations of
the Pacific and Indian Oceans—are among the most vulnerable
to climate change, seasonal-to-interannual climate variability,
and sea-level rise. Much of their critical infrastructure and many
socioeconomic activities tend to be located along the coastline,
in many cases at or close to present sea level (Nurse, 1992;
Pernetta, 1992; Hay and Kaluwin, 1993). Coastal erosion, saline
intrusion, sea flooding, and land-based pollution already are seri-
ous problems that many of these countries face. Supplies of
high-quality potable water often are inadequate, and water sup-
ply systems tend to lack adequate storage capacity. Moreover,
valuable coastal ecological systems currently are stressed by
human activities in the coastal zone and inland, reducing their
capacity to adapt to the effects of climate change and sea-level
tise. Pressures on these resources continue to increase in most
small islands, partly as a consequence of high population growth
rates, increasing urbanization, tourism development, and greater
demand for material goods and services.

presented in Annex A of this report. Figure 9-2a shows that, for
the Caribbean islands, average annual temperatures have
increased by more than 0.5°C over the period 1900-1995; the
seasonal data are consistent with this overall trend. In the spe-
cific case of Cuba, for which a study of observed temperature
trends has been undertaken, Centella ef al. (1996) found that
mean air temperature has risen by 0.6°C during the past 45
years. Rainfall data for the same period show much greater sea-
sonal, interannual, and decadal-scale variability, although a
declining trend in average annual rainfall—on the order of 250
mm—is evident (see Figure 9-2b). Average annual temperature
also has increased since 1900 in the Pacific islands; the magni-
tude of the increase in this area, however, is less than 0.5°C, and
seasonal trends are not coherent, nor do they track the annual
average. Similarly, the rainfall data show considerable decadal-

future projections of climate change for small islands.
Nonetheless, because the climate of these islands is influenced
by the surrounding oceans, and the oceans are expected to

the small island states also are likely to experience moderate
warming. Pittock et al. (1995) have made some progress

different rates of warming, the efficiency of ocean circulation, and

"An annual mean rise in tropical sea-surface temperature of about
1,0°C is projected by AOGCMs (with a doubling of CO,), with
no appreciable differences between the two seasons. This pro-
jection is in agreement with the analysis of Wigley and Santer
(1993)—who were confident that, although the magnitude of the
warming in the Caribbean is uncertain, the sign of the projection
is correct. The models also suggest some differential mean
warming of the eastern and western Pacific Ocean. Small reduc-

"For the IS92a emission scenario, it is estimated that sea level
would rise, on average, about 5 mm/yr, within a range of
uncertainty of 2-9 mm/yr (IPCC 1996, WG I, Section

vary significantly from this global projection, as a result of
factors such as vertical land movements (Aubrey and Emery,
1993; Hendry, 1993; Maul, 1996) and dynamic effects due to
ocean circulation, wind and pressure patterns, and ocean-

"Mean rainfall intensity is projected to increase by approxi-
mately 20-30% over the tropical oceans (the main locations of
the small island states) at the time of doubling of CO).
However, simulation experiments with combined GHG and
aerosol forcings suggest that mean precipitation might
decrease during summer over the Mediterranean Sea region,
leading to a higher probability of dry soils in islands located in
this region (i.e., Cyprus and Malta). Relatively greater increas-
es in mean rainfall are projected for the central equatorial
Pacific Ocean region (see IPCC 1996, WG I, Section 6.2).

"Various studies have attempted to assess possible climate
change-related changes in extreme events, but few assessments
have focused specifically on small island states. Several mod-
els, for instance, project an increase in precipitation intensity,
tunoff, and possible flooding for latitudes within which many
of the islands are located. In a few cases, the possibility of
change in the occurrence of droughts also has been projected.
Given the constraints of scaling and resolution in the models
with respect to small islands (see Section 9.2.3.1.) and the cur-
Tent status of inter-model agreement, however, such projec-

"Gray (1993) reports that, based on historical data for the
Caribbean Sea, increases in sea-surface temperature of 1.5°C
have been associated with an increase in hurricane frequency.
Although there is some uncertainty in the data base, projected
increases of this magnitude represent approximately 40% more
hurricane activity than normal. More recently, Holland (1997)
projects that the intensity of tropical cyclones could increase
by 10-20% under 2xCO, conditions. In contrast, observed data
suggest that, in the vicinity of longitudes 105-160°E (in the
region of Australia), the total number of tropical cyclones
between 1969-70 and 1995-96 has decreased, although there
were slight increases in the number of strong systems and the
duration of the cyclones (Nicholls et al., 1997).

"Although these projections are lower than the IPCC (1990)
estimates, it should be emphasized that the current best esti-
mates for sea-level rise represent a rate approximately two to
four times higher than the rate experienced in the past 100
years (i.e., 1.0-2.5 mm/yr). Model runs also show that sea level
would continue to rise beyond the year 2100 (because of lags
in the climate response), even with assumed stabilization of
global GHG emissions (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 9.3.1.1).
Recent estimates by Pittock et al. (1995) indicate a sea-level

"Given current projected rates of increase, sea-level rise per se
is not expected to have widespread adverse effects on coral
reefs. Indeed, some researchers argue that a rising sea level
actually may be beneficial because the new conditions would
be favorable for inducing vertical growth; in contrast, reef
growth has been largely horizontal in the recent past, as a con-
sequence of lower sea levels (Wilkinson and Buddemeier,
1994). Edwards (1995) further suggests that even slowly
accreting reef flats should be able to cope with projected sea-
level rise, in the absence of other negative forces (e.g., elevat-

"Coral reefs represent one of the most important resources of
tropical islands. They perform valuable functions, including
supplying sand to beaches and playing a critical role in the for-

and nursery grounds for numerous species of reef fish. Reefs
also function as protective barriers for beaches and coasts by
reducing incident wave energy through the processes of wave
reflection, dissipation, and shoaling; they also are significant

"Research Institute, 1990). In some islands, some species of
corals currently live at or near their threshold of temperature
tolerance (Goreau, 1992). Corals respond to the combined
effects of irradiance and water temperature elevation by paling
in color, or bleaching. However, corals generally do not bleach
simply as a result of rapid fluctuation in water temperature but
rather as a result of departures in temperature above their sea-
sonal maximums. If the temperature elevation is substantial
over an extended period (e.g., 3-4°C for >6 months), signifi-
cant coral mortality is likely (Brown and Suharsono, 1990). On
the other hand, if the temperature increase is relatively small
(e.g., 1-2°C) for a short period, bleached corals may recover,
though with reduced growth and impaired reproductive capa-
bilities (Goreau, 1992; Brown and Ogden, 1993), A compre-
hensive review of the causes and consequences of coral bleach-

"The capacity of mangrove forests to cope with sea-level rise is
higher where the rate of sedimentation approximates or
exceeds the rate of local sea-level rise. Indeed, Hendry and
Digerfeldt (1989) have shown that mangrove communities in
western Jamaica were able to keep pace with mid-Holocene
sea-level rise (ca. 3.8 mm/yr). However, the adaptive capacity
of mangroves and other coastal wetlands to sea-level rise (usu-
ally by landward migration) is now severely limited in many
localities by increasing human activities. It has been suggested,
for instance, that a 1-m rise in sea level in Cuba will drastical-
ly affect the viability of 333,000 ha of these wetland commu-
nities (approximately 93% of Cuba’s mangroves) (Perez et al.,
1996). Additionally, adaptive capacity will vary among
species; some species of mangroves appear to be more robust
and resilient than others to the effects of climate change and
sea-level rise (Ellison and Stoddart, 1991; Aksornkaoe and
Paphavasit, 1993).

"On the other hand, Snedaker (1993) argues that mangroves in
the Caribbean are more likely to be affected by changes in pre-

the Caribbean would reduce mangroves’ productive potential
and increase their exposure to full-strength seawater. Thus,
peat substrates would subside as a result of anaerobic decom-
position by sulfate-reducing microorganisms, leading to the
elimination of mangroves in affected areas (Snedaker, 1993).

importance as sources of timber, fuel, and many nonwood
products. Furthermore, forests provide a broad range of other
economic and social goods, even though their true value may
be difficult to quantify. For example, they provide a basis for

"It is possible that tropical forests will be affected more by
anthropogenic forces than by climate change per se, as long as
deforestation continues at its current rate (IPCC 1996, WG II,
Box 1-5). Tropical forests are likely to be affected more by
changes in soil water availability (caused by the combined
effects of changes in temperature and rainfall) than by changes
in temperature alone. Forests are particularly vulnerable to
extremes of water availability (drought or flooding) and will
decline rapidly if conditions move toward one of these
extremes. Increasing temperature and extreme events also may
increase the incidence of pests and pathogens, as well as the

growth rates. Few studies have been conducted specifically on
the effects of climate change on agriculture in small islands
(IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 13.6.4). However, those investiga-

intrusions caused by overpumping and excess evapotranspira-
tion (Cant, 1996). Sea-level rise may precipitate the intrusion
of saltwater into the freshwater lens, reducing the quality and
quantity of potable water, if the recharge rate or the width of
the island is reduced. In contrast, if recharge and island-width
remain constant or expand with rising sea level, the freshwater
lens may increase in size (Buddemeier and Oberdorfer, 1990).

capacity of species and ecosystems, such as mangroves, to shift
their ranges and locations in response to climate change will be
hindered by land-use practices that have fragmented existing

"In many small island states (such as the islands of the eastern
Caribbean), the annual rainfall regime often is characterized
by pronounced wet and dry seasons. In some countries (e.g.,
Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Grenada), as much as 65%
of the annual rainfall may occur during the wet season (June
to December); this rainfall is associated largely with the
northerly migration of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone
(ITCZ) and the passage of major weather systems such as
easterly waves, tropical depressions, storms, and hurricanes
(Nurse, 1985; Gray, 1993), Therefore, to the extent that the
availability of water resources in these islands is dependent
on heavy rainfall events, changes in the occurrence of these
phenomena inevitably will impact water supplies. In the
south Pacific, the SPCZ plays a similar role (Salinger et al.,
1995).

regions of the Southern Hemisphere, the ENSO phenomenon is
a major factor in year-to-year climate variability, with a marked
effect on rainfall patterns (Pittock, 1984; Philander, 1990;
Whetton et al., 1996). Similarly, floods experienced in the Gulf
states, Cuba, and other parts of the Americas in the early 1980s
and hurricanes in Tahiti and Hawaii during the same period have
been linked to a major ENSO event in 1982-83 (Shea, 1994),
Possible climate changes associated with ENSO events could
have serious consequences for water supplies and agriculture in
many nations. As with sea-level rise, atoll communities depen-

extension of the dry season by 45 days would lead to a decrease
in maize yields of 30-50%. Similarly, yields from sugarcane

tively. On the other hand, Singh et a/. (1990) found that signif-
icantly increased rainfall (>50%) during the wet season on the

the effects of sea-level rise will exacerbate water scarcity. The
crop expected to be most seriously affected is pulaka (giant
taro). Reduced yields from pulaka pits are “likely to have sig-
nificant cultural ramifications, given the central role of this crop
in Tuvaluan society” (SPREP, 1996, Section 6.4.1). The culti-

Pandanus and Cocos nucifera and anchored in holes 60

account for approximately 1% of the global economy, many
coastal and island states are far more dependent on the sector
than this statistic would suggest (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section

shelves and banks of the Caribbean islands (excluding the U.S.
Virgin Islands) has a retail value in restaurants of approxi-

effects that alter the rainfall regime, increase evaporation, or
reduce soil moisture would affect agricultural production—
possibly with adverse consequences for food security and
nutrition in many countries. Crop yields in small island states
in the Pacific are projected to decrease as a consequence of
reduced solar radiation (resulting from increased cloudiness),
higher temperatures (causing shorter growth duration and
increased sterility in some cultivars), and changes in water
availability (because of changes in the frequency of droughts
and floods, as well as changes in their spatial and temporal dis-
tribution) (Singh e¢ al., 1990). Seawater intrusion also would
degrade the fertility of coastal soils and consequently con-
tribute to a reduction in yields (IPCC 1996, WGIL, Sections

McLean and d’Aubert, 1993; McLean and Woodroffe, 1993).
For example, the extent to which relative sea-level rise will
affect coastal recession rates will depend on many factors,
including (though not limited to) the rate of sediment supply
relative to submergence; the width of existing fringing reefs;
the rate of reef growth; whether islands are anchored to emer-

"There is some evidence that clam and sea-turtle fisheries could
be sensitive to sea temperature changes. Clams, like corals,
are known to suffer from bleaching with the expulsion of sym-
biotic algae, as a result of excesses in temperature or radiation
(Gomez and Belda, 1988; Lucas er a/., 1988). Bleaching
would cause “loss of productivity or devastation in stocks of
growout clams on the reef-flats” (Wilkinson and Buddemeier,
1994). One possible option to minimize this possibility in
locations where commercial clam mariculture is practiced
(e.g., the Solomon Islands, Palau, Samoa) in deeper water,
where light and temperature fluctuations would be reduced.
This measure, however, will result in lower growth rates and
reduced returns to the grower (Lucas et al., 1988; Wilkinson
and Buddemeier, 1994). In the case of sea turtles, most species
nest during the summer, when temperatures are close to the
organisms’ upper thermal limit. It is uncertain whether turtles
will be able to adapt to warmer temperatures by nesting in the
cooler months (Limpus, 1993). If such adaptation is not pos-
sible, increased temperatures are likely to result in a higher
ratio of females to males because the sex ratio of sea turtles is
directly determined by temperature (Wilkinson and
Buddemeier, 1994).

could become more frequent, resulting in the proliferation and
increased transmission of cholera. Recent research has shown
a clear relationship between increased incidence of cholera
outbreaks and sea warming, owing to the ability of zooplank-
ton to function as a reservoir for a dormant state of the
pathogen (Colwell, 1996). In general, biotoxins such as
ciguatera are known to be temperature sensitive; therefore,
they could become more abundant with ocean warming,
Tesulting in a higher incidence of seafood contamination and
biotoxin poisoning. Microbiological contamination already is
a problem in the coastal areas of many small islands, where

"Among the strategies that could be adopted to ameliorate
some of the negative effects of climate change on the health
sector are the mounting of an effective public education pro-
gram aimed at improving personal behavior and hygiene;
upgrading, extension, and maintenance of existing health-
care facilities and services; implementation and mainte-
nance of appropriate, cost-efficient sewage and solid-waste
management systems; adoption of appropriate disaster pre-
paredness and management plans; and wider application of
available protective technologies, such as water purification
and sewage treatment (McMichael et al., 1996). In addition,
Health Early Warning Systems (HEWS)—which incorpo-
rate seasonal and interannual climate forecast information—
could be used to detect ecological conditions conducive to
outbreaks of climate-sensitive diseases such as cholera,
malaria, and dengue. Lessening the vulnerability of small
islands to such health threats through these types of
improved planning measures and implementation of timely
strategies would reduce human suffering and economic
losses.

"In many small island states, a number of factors, including iso-
lation and close traditional ties to the land and sea, have con-
tributed to the development of a unique set of cultural traits on
different islands or groups of islands. In Tuvalu, for instance—
as in other small Pacific atoll states—attachment to land and sea
is a critical component of local cosmology (SPREP, 1996). Any
force that poses a threat to this attachment would be culturally
and socially disruptive in these traditional societies.
"	Text
"Ethnic, linguistic, social, and religious differences among and
between the peoples of Polynesia, Melanesia, and Micronesia
in the South Pacific illustrate the cultural diversity of the island
states. The unique cultures that have developed over millenia
on the resource-rich and diverse high-volcanic and limestone
islands in the region, such as Vanuatu, Fiji, and Samoa, are
unlikely to be seriously threatened by climate change. On the
other hand, resource-poor, low-reef islands and atolls, which
have developed equally distinctive traditional identities over
centuries—such as the Tuvaluan, Kiribati, Marshallese, and
Maldivian cultures—are more at risk. The fragility of these low
islands and their sensitivity to sea-level change and storms sug-
gest that the future existence of such islands and their cultural
diversity could be seriously threatened (Roy and Connell,
1991).
"	Text
"It must be emphasized, however, that the sensitivity of
small islands to the projected effects of climate change can-
not be attributed to any single factor (e.g., size, elevation,
remoteness, or any other) or to a select group of factors.
Rather, the level of vulnerability of these islands is deter-
mined by the cumulative and synergistic result of these and
related biophysical attributes (including the degree of nat-
ural adaptive capacity), combined with the islands’ eco-
nomic and sociocultural characters (including current and
future levels of anthropogenic stress) (see, e.g., SPREP,
1996). Moreover, because many small islands already are
prone to other hazards (e.g., tropical cyclones and storm
surges) that invariably have adverse effects, climate change
impacts on longer time scales could render these countries
extremely vulnerable.
"	Text
"Moreover, for small islands with limited resources, it is
absolutely essential for integrated assessment models to
include the value of nonmarketed goods and services that also
will be at risk. Commodities such as cultural and subsistence
assets (¢.g., community structures), recreational values, tradi-
tional skills and knowledge, and natural values (e.g., the
capacity of mangroves to filter nitrate and phosphate and thus
reduce nutrient loading to the marine zone) are just as impor-
tant to some small islands as marketed goods and services.
Such nonmarketed goods and services often are not incorpo-
rated into integrated assessment models. From the perspective
of small island states, the integration of these assets is an
important and necessary challenge facing the modeling com-
munity. Some recent attempts to develop an appropriate
methodology for vulnerability assessment, incorporating these
factors, have been made by Yamada et al. (1995) for south-
west Pacific islands.
"	Text
"The Caribbean countries are a case in point. Some face an
annual threat from hurricanes (cyclones); others, such as St.
Vincent and Montserrat, are prone to disruptive volcanic activ-
ity; and still others are affected by periodic earthquakes and
tsunamis (Maul, 1996). Most have extensive, vulnerable, low-
lying coastal plains; some (e.g., Barbados, Antigua, St. Kitts,
Bahamas) are heavily dependent on groundwater supplies; and
for many, tourism is the most vital economic sector. A higher
incidence of flooding and inundation, beach and coastal land
loss, reef damage, salinization of the freshwater lens, and dis-
tuption of tourism and infrastructure would create economic
and social crises in a number of these islands. Thus, many
Caribbean countries must be classified as vulnerable to the
effects of climate change and sea-level rise—not simply
because of their size or elevation alone but because of strong
linkages between these and other physical characteristics, nat-
ural resources, and socioeconomic structures.
"	Text
"Because of their strong dependence on economic sectors that
are highly sensitive to climate change effects (e.g., coastal
tourism and agriculture), small island states clearly are a vul-
nerable group of countries (IPCC 1996, WG III, Sections
6.5.10, 6.5.11). Briguglio (1993) developed a mean “vulnera-
bility index” for different categories of nations, based on three
selected variables: export dependence, insularity and remote-
ness, and proneness to natural disasters. Although there may
be some limitations associated with this index (e.g., the
restricted criteria), it supports the widely held view that small
island states will be more vulnerable than any other group of
countries to projected climate change impacts. On a scale
from 0 (lowest vulnerability) to 1 (highest vulnerability), a
score of 0.590 (the highest index) was derived for the small
island group. A lower index, 0.539, was calculated for other
developing countries; the index for all developing countries as
a group was 0.417. Indeed, based on Briguglio’s index, 9 of
the 10 most vulnerable countries are small islands. Thus,
though the index has its limitations, it draws attention to the
high vulnerability of small island states in relation to all other
regional groups.
"	Text
"Clearly, it would be inappropriate to assess the sensitivity of
small islands to climate change impacts in isolation from other
factors that contribute to their overall vulnerability.
Constraining factors such as size, elevation, limited resources
(natural, financial, and technological), proneness to natural
hazards, dependence on external markets, and generally high
population growth rates enhance the vulnerability of these
island states (Alm et al., 1993). Only when the effects of such
factors are evaluated in combination with the threat of climate
change impacts can a meaningful vulnerability index for small
island states be developed and appropriate adaptation options
pursued (see Box 9-6).

"Temperate Asia is composed of three regions: monsoon Asia,
excluding its tropical subregion; the inner arid/semi-arid
regions; and Siberia. The region includes countries in Asia
between 18°N and the Arctic Circle, including the Japanese
islands, the Korean peninsula, Mongolia, most parts of China,

about 8,000 km, and its north-south extent is about 5,000 km.
The largest plateau in the world—the Qing-Zang plateau
(Tibetan plateau), with an average elevation of more than 4,000
m—is located in southwest China. Inner Siberia, with a mean

"Over the past century, the average annual temperature in
Temperate Asia has increased by more than 1°C. This increase
has been most evident since the 1970s; seasonally, the warming
is evident mainly in winter. Subregionally, over the past 100
years, there has been a 2-4°C temperature increase in eastern and
northeastern Temperate Asia and a 1-2°C temperature decrease
in some parts of southeasten China, except for the coastal area.
These trends also are reflected in corresponding seasonal temper-
ature distributions, except that summer temperatures in central
Siberia actually are decreasing. In terms of precipitation, large
decadal variability seems to have masked a smaller positive trend
in annual precipitation. Over the past 100 years, there has been a
20-50% increase in east Siberia; a 10-20% increase across the
Korean peninsula, northeast China, the Huaihe River Basin, and
the Yellow River Basin; and a 10-20% decrease in Japan and the
southern half of east China, including Taiwan. The increasing
trend in annual precipitation in northeast China is evident mainly
in spring and summer rainfall; in south China, annual winter pre-
cipitation shows a slight positive trend, in contrast to a negative
trend in total annual precipitation.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Introduction conditions prevail over most of the monsoon-affected area
"	Figure
"Hydrologically, model results suggest that the areas most
vulnerable to climate change would be in the northern part
of China. Projected changes in runoff are due mainly to
changes in precipitation in spring, summer, and autumn
because of the strong influence of the monsoon climate.
The most critical uncertainty is the lack of credible projec-
tions of the effect of climate change on either the Asian
monsoon or the ENSO phenomenon, both of which strong-
ly influence river runoff. In moderately and extremely dry
years, the projected potential water deficiency caused by
climate change—although less than that caused by popula-
tion growth and economic development—may exacerbate
seriously the existing water shortage.

"In equilibrium and transient-response numerical experiments
with GCMs, precipitation is projected to marginally increase
(<0.5 mm/day) at the time of CO, doubling during the winter
(DJF) throughout the region. In the summer (JJA), the spatial
pattern of projected changes in precipitation is not uniform
over the region. Model projections suggest that precipitation
will increase slightly (0.5—1.0 mm/day) in the northern part of
the region (Siberia), and by more than 1 mm/day over the
Korean peninsula, the Japanese islands, and the southwestern
part of China. In contrast, precipitation may decline in the
northern, western, and southern parts of China. The projected
decline in rainfall over most of China is substantial in numeri-
cal experiments that include the effects of sulfate aerosols.

Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya are all located in the coastal
zone; together, they account for more than 50% of Japan’s
industrial production. In these metropolitan areas, already
about 860 km? of coastal land—an area supporting 2 mil-
lion people and with physical assets worth $450 billion—
are below mean high-water level. With a 1-m rise in mean
sea level, the area below mean high-water level would
expand by a factor of 2.7, embracing 4.1 million people
and assets worth more than $900 billion. The same sea-
level rise would expand the flood-prone area from 6,270
km? to 8,900 km?. The cost of adjusting existing protec-
tion measures has been estimated at about $80 billion.

One of the potential threats that sea-level rise poses is exac-
erbated beach erosion. Sandy beaches occupy 20-25% of the
total length of the Japanese coast. About 120 km? of these
beaches have been eroded over the past 70 years. An addi-

Summary Points

For boreal forests, which are concentrated mainly in the
Russian Federation, models suggest large shifts in distrib-
ution (e.g., area reductions of up to 50%) and productivi-
ty. In the boreal region, grasslands and shrublands may
expand significantly, whereas the tundra zone may
decrease by up to 50%, according to model predictions.
Climatic warming would increase the release of methane
from deep peat deposits—particularly from tundra soils,
since they would become wetter. The release of CO, is
expected to increase, though not by more than 25% of its
present level.

It is likely that by 2050, up to a quarter of the existing
mountain glacier mass would disappear. For areas with
very large glaciers, the extra runoff may persist for a cen-
tury or more. By 2050, the volume of runoff from glaciers
in central Asia is projected to increase threefold.
Eventually, however, glacial runoff will taper off or even
cease. Projected future glacier runoff is about 68 km3/yr in
2100, compared with the present value of 98 km3/yr.
Permafrost in northeast China is expected to disappear if
the temperature were to increase by 2°C or more. Over the
Qing-Zang plateau, estimates of the impact of climate
change on permafrost range from its complete disappear-
ance as a result of a temperature increase of 2°C to a
raising of its elevation limit to 4,600 m as a result of a
warming of 3°C.

Hydrologically, model results suggest that the areas most
vulnerable to climate change would be in the northern part
of China. Projected changes in runoff are due mainly to

"vary widely in range. Possible large negative impacts on
rice production as a consequence of climate change would
be of concern in the face of expected population increases,
In China, across different scenarios and different sites, yield
changes for several crops by 2050 are projected to be -78%
to +15% for rice, -21% to +55% for wheat, and -19% to
+5% for maize. An increase in productivity may occur if the
positive effects of CO, on crop growth are considered, but
the magnitude of the fertilization effect remains uncertain.

Climate change is projected to have favorable impacts on
agriculture in the northern areas of Siberia and to cause a
general northward shift of crop zones. Grain production in
southwestern Siberia is projected to fall by about 20% as
a result of a more arid climate.

Projections for 2010 indicate that the need for industrial
roundwood could increase by 38% (southern Temperate
Asia) to 96% (eastern Temperate Asia). These require-
ments may result in serious shortages of boreal industrial
roundwood, placing further stress on boreal forests.

Along most of the continental coast, relative sea level (i.e.,
sea level in relation to land) is an important factor for
coastal environments. Deltaic coasts in China face severe
problems from relative sea-level rise as a result of tectoni-
cally and anthropogenically induced land subsidence. In
the next 50 years, the expected worldwide sea-level rise
due to climate change will not be a major factor in relative
sea-level rise for the Old Huanghe and Changjiang deltas in
China, although it may be for the Zhujiang delta. Sea-level
rise due to global warming will, however, exacerbate prob-
lems in all three deltas, along with saltwater intrusion prob-
lems in deltaic regions and coastal plains. China, however,
has a long history in defenses against sea encroachment.

Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya are all located in the coastal
zone; together, they account for more than 50% of Japan’s
industrial production. In these metropolitan areas, already
about 860 km? of coastal land—an area supporting 2 mil-
lion people and with physical assets worth $450 billion—
are below mean high-water level. With a 1-m rise in mean
sea level, the area below mean high-water level would

effects of stresses on human health from hot weather and

studies that consider different sectors and their response to
adaptation strategies.

Conclusion: The major impacts of global warming on
Temperate Asia will likely take the form of large shifts of
the boreal forests, the disappearance of significant por-
tions of mountain glaciers, and shortages in the water sup-
ply. The most critical uncertainty in these estimates stems
from the lack of credible projections of the hydrological
cycle under global warming scenarios. The effects of cli-
mate change on the Asian monsoon and the ENSO phe-
nomenon are among the major uncertainties in the model-
ing of the hydrological cycle. Projections of agricultural
crop yields are uncertain not only because of the uncer-
tainty in the hydrological cycle but also because of the
potential positive effects of CO, and production practices.
In the coastal zones, sea-level rise endangers sandy beach-
es but remains an anthropogenically induced problem in
deltaic areas. Integrated impact studies that consider mul-
tiple stress factors are needed.

"An increase in the frequency or severity of heat waves
would cause an increase in (predominantly cardiorespira-
tory) mortality and illness. Studies of urban populations in
Temperate Asia indicate that the number of heat-related
deaths would increase several-fold in response to modeled
climate change scenarios for 2050.

North China—including Beijing, Tianjin, the four
provinces (Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi), part of
Anhui province, and part of inner Mongolia—is an eco-
nomic center of the country. It also is a topographic and
climatological entity. Because this region already is at risk
from normal climate variability, it also is likely to be quite
vulnerable to long-term secular shifts.

1) Water resources: Water resources in north China are
vulnerable to climate change because of already low
levels of available per capita water supplies, water
projects that already are highly developed, large
changes in river runoff related mainly to variability in
flood season, and rapid economic development. Water
resources also are sensitive to climate change because
of the critical dependence of floods on the Asian mon-
soon and the ENSO phenomenon.

2) Agriculture: This region appears to be especially sen-
sitive to climate change because of potential increas-
es in the soil moisture deficit. Warming and increased
evapotranspiration, along with possible declines in
precipitation, would make it difficult to maintain the
current crop pattern in areas along the Great Wall and
would limit the present practice of cultivating two
crops in succession in the Huang-Hai Plains.
Although climate warming may cause northward
shifts of subtropical crop areas, frequent waterlogging
in the south and spring droughts in the north would
inhibit the growth of subtropical crops.

3) Forests: Demands for agriculture as a result of popu-
lation increases and changes in the characteristics of
arable lands due to climate change will likely result in
large reductions of forest area.

4) Coastal zones: Climate change will exacerbate the
already serious problem of relative sea-level rise
because of tectonic subsidence and heavy groundwa-
ter withdrawal. Defense against sea encroachment
would be the only viable response because of the high
concentration of population and economic activities.
Contamination of groundwater by seawater intrusion
would further worsen the water resource shortage
problem.

urban population. For cities in Japan with a population of 6-7
million, the temperature difference is about 0.8°C; for Beijing,
it is only about 0.4°C (Japan Meteorological Agency, 1996).
Cities located in the northern part of South Korea show signif-
icantly higher warming trends than those in the southern part,
especially in the anomalies of monthly mean minimum tem-

fisheries, and transportation around the area. Because this area
is the southernmost ocean in the Northern Hemisphere where
sea ice forms, a sea ice-albedo feedback may occur early and
effectively. These results suggest an early disappearance of sea
ice and thus a large sea-surface temperature (SST) rise over the

ate desert scrub, and the area of cool temperate desert scrub
would expand to the Khangai mountains, supplanting forest
areas (Ulziisaikhan, 1996). At the same time, low- and midland
parts of central Asia are likely to change gradually into a more
arid interior desert as the disappearance of mountain glaciers
reduces the volume of summer runoff. Projection of potential
changes in the total extent of cool semi-deserts varies among
models; Whereas BIOME 1.1 suggests an almost 50% reduc-

desertification arises from adverse climatic conditions and

delta are major areas of economic activity in China. The
metropolises of Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangzhou
(Canton) are located within these three deltas, respec-

Zhujiang delta have a tectonic uplifting rate of 1
mm/yr). The Old Huanghe delta and the Changjiang

in the past as a result of groundwater extraction. Recent
efforts to mitigate this problem have been successful in
reducing the subsidence rate. It is estimated that these

for the Old Huanghe delta and 3-5 mm/yr for the
Changjiang delta. In the Zhujiang delta, natural progra-

have resulted in a 0.5—1 mm/yr sea-level rise in the dis-
tributaries in the estuarine area—the same order of mag-

"Forests of the Hokuriku region on the Japan Sea side of central
Japan are likely to respond to climatic change (Kojima, 1996).
Of the four vegetation belts, the Pinus pumila zone—the highest
belt in elevation—would be most seriously affected. It may
remain only in small areas at higher elevations or even become
fragmented by the upward advance of plant species adapted to a
warmer Climate. Uncertainties from the viewpoint of vegetation
are the rate of geographical expansion of plant species, the time
lag between climate change and soil change, and phenological
(seasonal) and environmental adaptation of plant species.

"Almost all forest trees would grow better under a warmer cli-
mate, but increases in diseases, insect damages, and other
meteorological hazards (e.g., severe storm damage) also may
result in a shortened life for forest trees (Tsunekawa et al.,
1996a). When the original species in a forest decline, other
species from neighboring forest zones more suitable for
warmer conditions would grow. If there were an afforested
region or broad cultivated area between natural forests, such
changes would not occur. The impact of warming would occur
noticeably on a time scale of decades to centuries, in areas
where the distribution of plant communities is continuous.

"Forest and grassland fire is expected to occur more frequently
and in broader areas in northern parts of Temperate Asia as a
result of global warming and deforestation activities. In May
1987, one of the largest forest fires of the past 30 years
occurred in China and Russia. In the Daxinganlin mountain
tange of northeast China, it was reported that the total area
burned was 1,010 x 103 ha, at 729 sites. The most serious wild-
fire in the forests and grasslands in Mongolia occurred in
March 1996. The burned-out area was estimated to be about
8,000 x 103 ha. Although the occurrence of forest fires varies
greatly each year, such serious cases should be taken into con-
sideration in global warming impact studies.

patterns associated with the two monsoons and the occurrence
of tropical cyclones in the two core areas of cyclogenesis (the
northern Indian Ocean and the northwestern Pacific Ocean).
Over the past 100 years, mean surface temperatures across the
region have increased in the range of 0.3—0.8°C. No long-term
trend in mean rainfall has been discernible over that period,
although many countries have shown a decreasing trend in the
past three decades. Similarly, no identifiable change in the
number, frequency, or intensity of tropical cyclones has been
observed in the region over the past 100 years; however, sub-

duction associated with CO, fertilization will be more than
offset by reductions in yield resulting from temperature and/or
moisture changes. Although climate change impacts could
result in significant changes in crop yields, production, storage,
and distribution, the net effect of the changes regionwide is
uncertain because of varietal differences and local differences
in growing season, crop management, and so forth; noninclu-

physiographically diverse and ecologically rich in natural and

region is about 1.6 billion, and the population is projected to
increase to 2.4 billion by 2025; although this population is
principally rural, in 1995, the region included 6 of the 25
largest cities in the world. Exploitation of natural resources
associated with rapid urbanization, industrialization, and eco-
nomic development has led to increasing pollution, land degra-
dation, and other environmental problems. Climate change repre-
sents a further stress. Over the long period of human occupation
in the region, human use systems have developed some
resilience to a range of environmental stresses. However, it is
uncertain whether such resilience can continue in the face of
rapid socioeconomic development, increasing population, and
projected changes in climate.

"The Himalayas play a critical role in the provision of water to
continental monsoon Asia. Increased temperature and
increased seasonal variability in precipitation are expected to
result in accelerated recession of glaciers and increasing dan-
ger from glacial lake outburst floods. A reduction in flow of
snow-fed rivers, accompanied by increases in peak flows and
sediment yields, would have major impacts on hydropower
generation, urban water supply, and agriculture. Availability of
water from snow-fed rivers may increase in the short term but
decrease in the long term. Runoff from rain-fed rivers may
change in the future, although a reduction in snowmelt water
would result in a decrease in dry-season flow of these rivers.
Larger populations and increasing demands in the agricultural,
industrial, and hydropower sectors will put additional stress on
water resources. Pressure will be most acute on drier river
basins and those subject to low seasonal flows. Hydrological
changes in island and coastal drainage basins are expected to
be small, apart from those associated with sea-level rise.

higher temperatures and higher humidity are superimposed on
existing conditions and projected increases in population,

"Sea-level rise is the most obvious climate-related impact in
coastal areas. Densely settled and intensively used low-lying
coastal plains, islands, and deltas are especially vulnerable to
coastal erosion and land loss, inundation and sea flooding,
upstream movement of the saline/freshwater front, and seawa-
ter intrusion into freshwater lenses. Especially at risk are the
large deltaic regions of Bangladesh, Myanmar, Viet Nam, and
Thailand, and the low-lying areas of Indonesia, the Philippines,
and Malaysia. Socioeconomic impacts could be felt in major
cities, ports, and tourist resorts; artisinal and commercial fish-
eries; coastal agriculture; and infrastructure development.
International studies have projected the displacement of sever-
al million people from the region’s coastal zone in the event of
a 1-m rise in sea level. The costs of response measures to
reduce the impact of sea-level rise in the region could be
immense.
"	Text
"Strategies for adapting to different climatic conditions will be
quite diverse. For example, responses to impacts on agriculture
will vary from region to region, depending on the local agro-
climatic setting as well as the magnitude of climate change.
New temperature- and pest-resistant crop varieties may be
introduced, and new technologies may be developed to reduce
crop yield losses. Countries in Tropical Asia could improve
irrigation efficiency from current levels, to reduce total water
requirements. Integrated approaches to river basin manage-
ment, which already are used in a number of countries in the
region, could be adapted regionwide. Such approaches could
increase the effectiveness of adapting to the often-complex
potential impacts of climate change that generally transcend
political boundaries and encompass upstream and downstream
areas. Similarly integrated approaches to coastal zone manage-
ment can include current and longer-term issues, including cli-
mate change and sea-level rise.

of cultivars and varieties. The diversity of managed plants and
animals is a result, in part, of climate and soil; it also reflects
the length of human settlement in Tropical Asia, as well as its
cultural and ethnic diversity. In addition, a number of animals,
insects, and microbes have developed in parallel with the veg-

types of floods are common: riverine flood, flash flood, glacial lake
outburst flood, and breached landslide-dam flood (bishayri), the
latter two are limited to mountainous regions of Nepal, Bhutan,

expected to grow from the present 1.6 billion to about 2.4 billion,

the world’s 25 largest cities were located in Tropical Asia:
Bombay (#5), Calcutta (#9), Jakarta (#11), Delhi (#17), Manila

In these and other cities of the region, rapid urban growth has
been accompanied by a proliferation of slums and squatter set-

trend discernible in the long-term mean for precipitation for the
region (Figure 11-2b) or in individual countries during this
time period, many countries have shown a decreasing trend in
rainfall in the past three decades. The southwest monsoon in
India has shown definite changes in the period 1961-1990, in
comparison with either 1901-1930 or 1931-1960, though no
consistent longer-term trend is detectable. In Viet Nam, mean
annual temperature has increased over the period 1895-1980,
with net warming estimated at 0.27°C over the past two
decades. Variations in rainfall also have been observed, with
geographical variation. Since the 1960s, annual rainfall has
been increasing in the north of Viet Nam and decreasing in the
south (Granich et al., 1993).

appear to show not only a eustatic component but also local
anthropogenic or meteorological effects. In Bangkok, for
example, extraction of water from groundwater aquifers has
resulted in accelerated land subsidence (i.e., a relative rise in
sea level) of around 20 mm/yr since 1960, compared with an
earlier trend of about 3 mm/yr (see IPCC 1996, WG II, Section
9.3.1); in contrast, high recent rates of sea-level rise in Manila
have been blamed on coastal reclamation (Spencer and
Woodworth, 1993). Analysis of time-series data for 1955-1990

maximum and minimum surface air temperatures of 0.7°C
and 1.0°C over the land regions in the decade of the 2040s
with respect to the 1980s. This warming would be less pro-
nounced during the monsoon season than in the winter
months. A significant decrease in the winter diurnal tempera-

season, also is projected (Lal et al., 1996). Moreover, pro-

"Despite the great strides that have been made in objective mod-
eling of climate and climate change through AOGCMs, there
still are uncertainties associated with model projections, espe-
cially for climate change on regional scales. The problem is
even more complicated when researchers attempt to project
time-dependent regional climatic responses to future increases
in radiative forcing from anthropogenic GHGs and aerosols.
Because the anthropogenically induced sulfate aerosol burden
has large spatial and temporal variations in the atmosphere, its
regional-scale impacts could be in striking contrast to the
impacts of GHGs—the concentrations of which are likely, in
most cases, to change uniformly throughout the globe. Spatially
localized radiative forcing resulting from anthropogenic
aerosols is confined largely to the Northern Hemisphere and
tends to yield a steepening of normalized meridional tempera-
ture gradient in that hemisphere. The effects of aerosols also
yield distinct precipitation responses in the tropical region in
general and over the Asian monsoon region in particular. The
implications of enhanced aerosol loading on tropospheric
clouds, which could strongly modulate the monsoon climate,
still are not clear. Because anthropogenic sulfate aerosol load-
ings are projected to be substantial over the southeast Asian
region, their impact on the Asian summer monsoon needs to be
more carefully examined. Their precise magnitude, as well as
the roles of other localized potential forcings (e.g., aerosols
from biomass burning, increases in tropospheric ozone), also
must be known before confident predictions of regional
changes in the monsoon climate and its variability can be made.

by climate change. Results from early greenhouse warming sim-
ulations in MPI-ECHAM3 model experiments reported in Lal
(1994) suggest that mean annual surface runoff throughout the
region could increase by about 15% by the end of the century,
with the greatest increases in northeast India and Indonesia.
However, a more recent study (Lal et al., 1995b) that takes into
account the combined effects of GHGs and aerosols suggests a
future decline in surface runoff throughout the region.

"In many parts of the region, the ratio of monsoon-to-dry-season
runoff is very high (e.g., nearly 6:1 for the Ganges River).
Because water requirements for agriculture and other water-use
sectors are significantly higher during the dry season than during
the monsoon, water supply in the dry season often cannot meet
demand. Any change in the availability of water resources as a
consequence of climate change may have a substantial effect on
agriculture, navigation, fisheries, industrial and domestic water
supply, reservoir storage and operation, and salinity control
(Divya and Mehrotra, 1995; Mirza and Dixit, 1997).

withdraws earlier, soil moisture deficits in some areas may get
worse. On the other hand, prolonged monsoons may contribute
to more frequent flooding and increase the depth of inundation
in many parts of the large river basins. If precipitation increas-
es, dry-season river flow may increase because of increased
techarge in the monsoon season. For instance, flooding is
experienced on the east coast of Malaysia and in the coastal
areas of Sarawak and Sabah almost every year during the rainy

"If climate change does alter the rainfall pattern in the
Himalayas, the impacts could be felt in the downstream coun-
tries—that is, India and Bangladesh. By and large, dry-season
flow in the major Himalayan rivers in a given year results from
the monsoon rainfall of the previous year. Catchments in Nepal
supply about 70% of the dry-season flow of the Ganges River,
and tributaries of the Brahmaputra River originating in Bhutan
supply about 15% of the total annual flow of that river. If cli-
mate change disrupts these resources and alters mountain
hydrological regimes, the effects will be felt not only in the
montane core of Tropical Asia but also downstream, in coun-
tries that depend on this water resource.

"Divya and Mehrotra (1995) examined regional effects of cli-
mate change on various components of the hydrological
cycle—such as surface runoff, soil moisture, and evapotranspi-
tation—by applying a conceptual model on a monthly time
scale. The experiment was conducted using hypothetical sce-
narios in three drainage basins located in different agroclimat-
ic zones of central India. The authors found that basin charac-
teristics—such as soil type, moisture-holding capacity, and
runoff coefficients—significantly influence basin runoff. More
recently, Mirza (1997) modeled nine subbasins of the Ganges
River using the GISS transient scenario (a global coupled
ocean-atmosphere climate model with 4x5-degree resolution).
The GCM experiment is based on 74 years, during which CO,
increases by 1% (compounded) per year. Mirza (1997) found
that changes in mean annual runoff in the range of 27-116%
occurred in the subbasins at doubled CO, and that runoff was
more sensitive to climate change in the drier subbasins than in
the wetter subbasins.

"The effects of climate change on hydrology in Tropical Asia
would have many facets. In the Himalayas, the storage of pre-
cipitation in the form of snow and ice (in glaciers) over a long
period provides a large water reservoir that regulates annual
water distribution. The majority of rivers originating in the
Himalayas have their upper catchments in snow-covered areas
and flow through steep mountains. This factor and the perenni-
al nature of the rivers provide excellent conditions for the
development of hydropower resources, despite the temporal
variability in the sources of runoff for Himalayan rivers.
Studies of one large catchment in the western Himalayas (the
Chenab, a tributary of the Indus) show that the average
snowmelt and glacier-melt contribution to the annual flow is
49.1%; a significant proportion of runoff is derived from snow
in the dry season, when water demand is highest (Singh et al.,
1997). Climate change-related increases in temperature also
could increase the rate of snowmelt and reduce the amount of
snowfall, if the winter is shortened.

function of discharge. The implications of these increases in
discharge on the sediment load of the Ganges and

considered; under a 4°C global mean temperature change sce-

increase by 27% (CSIRO9), 42% (UKMO), 15% (GFDL), or
2% (LLNL). Under the same temperature scenario, mean annu-

"Agriculture in Tropical Asia has evolved on the basis of
regionally available crop biodiversity; only a few crops from
other regions—such as wheat, potatoes, and tomatoes—have
competed with endemic crops and become widely cultivated.
Much of the land is intensively cropped, and there is a short-
age of agricultural land in some countries (see Annex D).
Most areas have the potential to produce a variety of crops
through year-round cultivation; in several areas, more than
one crop is grown annually on the same field. Many crop com-
binations are common, either individually or as intercrops.
Because farmers in the region utilize a variety of cropping sys-
tems, studies of one specific crop in one area cannot be extrap-
olated to represent tropical agriculture in Asia or its impact on
the agricultural economy in general. Some indication of the
range of potential impacts is highlighted in the examples

about half of a million tons of rice—nearly 30% of the country’s
average annual food grain imports (BBS, 1989; Paul and Rashid,
1993}—as a result of floods. In India, the crop area affected by
floods is nearly one-third of the average flood-prone area (GOI,

as groundwater pollution, appear to be taking place in some
high-productivity agricultural areas of the country (Sinha, 1997).

"Two additional factors increase the vulnerability of the agri-
cultural sector in the region. First, even though 35% of the
region’s land is irrigated (Annex D), a significant portion of
agriculture is rain-fed. About 46 million ha, or 88.5%, of glob-
al rain-fed lowland rice is cultivated in south and southeast
Asia (IRRI, 1993). In eastern India, approximately 80% of the
20 million ha of rice is grown in rain-fed lowlands (Zeigler and
Puckridge, 1995). Yields for rice under rain-fed conditions in
Asian tropical regions are low, compared with those of irrigat-
ed rice yields. A number of factors explain this pattern, includ-
ing floods, droughts, temporary inundation from rainfalls, and
tidal flows and coastal salinity (Hossain and Fischer, 1995).

importance of rice relative to other crops, as well as to meat

consists of 80% and 84% rice, respectively, with the remainder
predominantly maize. Rice production in India, Nepal, and the
Philippines accounts for 50%, 52%, and 66% of the cereal pro-

maize is another important cereal in the Philippines. With

assume a constraint-free environment for water, fertilizers,
pests, and other factors. Although there is an acknowledged
need for further improvement in such models, these estimates
clearly demonstrate that a single estimate of change in rice

place nearly 15 million, 7 million, and at least 2 million people
from their homes in Bangladesh, India, and Indonesia, respec-
tively; millions more could be threatened in Viet Nam,
Myanmar, Thailand, and the Philippines. (Potential impacts on
special tropical coastal ecosystems, including coral reefs and
mangroves, are discussed in Section 11.3.2.)

"In Nepal, Bhutan, and northern India, for instance, mountains
provide food, fuel, and fresh water—which are needed for
human survival and are fundamental resources for tourism and
economic development. Tourism contributes about 24% of
Nepal’s foreign-exchange earnings (HMGN, 1992). Seasonal
variations in the water resources of Nepal’s Himalaya region
are very high: The maximum-to-minimum discharge ratios for
the Karnali, Sapt Gandaki, and Sapt Kosi rivers are 120:1,
180:1, and 105:1, respectively. This variation is due mainly to
heavy and concentrated rainfall during a short time period;
steep topography, which encourages higher surface runoff; and
the high rate of deforestation in the watersheds (Uprety, 1988).

"Devastating floods occur in the central Himalaya of Nepal dur-
ing the monsoon months of June through September. Monsoon
floods differ from GLOFs and floods caused by breaching of
landslide dams: They are of longer duration and less sudden in
onset. The incessant rainfall of August 1987 submerged parts
of central and eastern Terai in waters of as much as 1 m
(BNJST, 1989). Damage from floods takes several forms,
including the destruction of footbridges that often provide the
only link between remote mountain villages; demolition of irri-
gation diversions; mass-wasting by undercutting of steep,
Stream-adjacent slopes; and damage to floodplain agricultural
land by erosion and sedimentation (Marston et al., 1996).

three small experimental plots in central Nepal. Over the 3-
year period of the experiment, 40-96% of the annual losses
occurred during two storms (Carver and Nakarmi, 1995).
Uprety (1988) found a statistically significant correlation
between monsoon precipitation in the Karnali and Spata Kosi

"At high elevations in the Himalayas, an increase in temperature
could result in faster recession of glaciers and an increase in
the number and extent of glacial lakes—many of which,
according to Watanabe et al. (1994), have formed in the past
several decades. The rapid growth of such lakes could exacer-
bate the danger from glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs),
with potentially disastrous effects. GLOFs result from the fail-
ure of moraine dams when excessive hydrostatic pressure is
exerted on dam walls as a result of increased melting and
increased water depth in lakes. In a warmer world, GLOFs
could be expected to increase in number and severity through-
out the Himalayas of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. Recent exam-
ples, which may be suggestive of increasingly frequent occur-
tences in the future, include the catastrophic outburst of two
glacial lakes in the Lunana area, northern Bhutan, in October
1994 (which resulted in the deaths of 21 persons and damage
to villages, washed away bridges, and filled water with debris
and large logs) and the 1985 outburst flood in Khumbu Himal,
Nepal (Watanabe and Rothacher, 1996).

malaria now occurs, its distribution was considerably reduced
or eliminated during the 1960s and 1970s. In recent years,
however, the situation has been worsening in frontier regions
of economic development (Porter, 1994). The emergence and

health concerns to all malaria-affected countries in the region

morbidity in Tropical Asia. Climate change may cause a
change in the distribution of malaria, dengue, bilharzia, leish-

vulnerable to extreme weather events such as tropical
cyclones, storms, and floods. The vulnerability of the popula-
tion to these events is significantly increased by high popula-
tion densities and poor sanitation; thus, waterborne and food-
borne infectious diseases also are major problems. For exam-
ple, waterborne and waterrelated diseases account for about
70% of the epidemic emergencies in India. The additional

"The magnitude of physical and socioeconomic impacts of sea-

West Johor, which is occupied by 150,000 people, has been
detailed by Teh and Voon (1992). In this example, a projected
coastal embankment failure resulting from sea-level rise would
result in a substantial reduction in the area under agriculture and
extensive damage to houses, schools, and other social amenities.
In addition, millions of dollars of revenue loss from the destruc-
tion of the three main crops (coconuts, oil palm, and rubber) ulti-
mately could involve a population shift inland. This example is
duplicated many times in the region, with the implication that
greenhouse-induced sea-level rise may require a reassessment of
existing and future coastal developments—as has been done in

Malaysia (Midun and Lee, 1995).

cyclonic surges; inland freshwater lakes, ponds, and aquifers
could be affected by saline and brackish-water intrusion. The
present limit of tidal influence is expected to move further
upstream, and increases in soil salinity, as well as surface-
water and groundwater salinity, may cause serious water sup-
ply problems for drinking and irrigation over large areas
(Alam, 1996). Reduced dry-season freshwater supply from
upstream sources may further exacerbate salinity conditions in
the coastal area of Bangladesh. These impacts clearly would

Martens er al. (1997) show that the transmission potential of
the three associated vector-borne diseases is highly sensitive to
climate changes on the periphery of the currently endemic
areas and at higher elevations within such areas, including
Tropical Asia. With reference to present endemic areas, their
findings show that the potential increase in epidemic transmis-

sion potential may be expected to exhibit a 11-17% decrease.

1987-1990, visceral leishmaniasis reached epidemic form in
the Indian state of Bihar and spread rapidly to surrounding
areas. WHO (1996a) estimated that about 110 million people
were at risk from visceral leishmaniasis. Major endemic foci are
reported in border areas between India (states of Bihar and West
Bengal), Bangladesh, and Nepal. In Bangladesh, visceral leish-
maniasis already has reached epidemic form; the most vuinera-
ble populations are poor and rural cattlekeepers. Reported cases
appear to cluster close to flood-control embankments; there
appears to be a significant risk that visceral leishmaniasis preva-
lence in some localities will increase as a result of flood-control
and drainage projects (ISPAN, 1992). In a warmer climate, the
incidence of visceral leishmaniasis also may increase (IPCC

"Increased incidence of malaria associated with climate change
may significantly strain the economies of many countries of
the region. Picard and Mills (1992) estimated losses of five
working days for infected persons, during the period from
infection to recovery, in two districts in Nepal. Mills (1994)
found that the economic consequences of malaria could be
high in the areas without malaria-control programs. The high
cost of alternative drugs has put enormous pressure on the
scarce economic resources of the countries in Asia (WHO,
1996a). ISPAN (1992) estimated that a complete course of
treatment in rural Bangladesh may cost one month’s wage for
an agricultural worker (about US$40), or roughly one-fifth of
overall per capita income. Hammer (1993) discusses the eco-
nomics of malaria treatment and cites examples from Nepal,
Thailand, and Indonesia—where the economic return of malar-

"Several estimates of the potential distribution of malaria have
been produced, using climate change scenarios from a num-
ber of GCMs. These projections indicate that, in the future,
malaria is most likely to extend its range into the fringes of
established endemic areas (Martens et al., 1995). In southeast
Asia, this would include new areas of Indonesia—notably
Sumatra and Irian Jaya—and Papua New Guinea (Porter,
1994). Martin and Lefebvre (1995) report that the intensity
and extent of malaria’s potential transmission would change
significantly under scenarios generated by the five GCMs
they used. In all cases, an increase in seasonal malaria at the
expense of perennial malaria results; such an increase is most
likely to lead to epidemics among unprepared or nonimmune
populations. Similarly, Martens et al. (1995) conclude that
newly affected populations would initially experience high

health measures, case management, and land use play more
significant roles in determining the prevalence of malaria than
does climate, the most appropriate policy is to introduce or
improve simple public health measures in the region; this
approach would ensure that, even with climate change, devel-
oping countries would be far less susceptible to marginal
increases in the potential prevalence of diseases such as malar-

"In the Bay of Bengal, evidence has been found—by synthesiz-
ing satellite remote-sensing, in-situ hydrographic and meteoro-
logical data sets, and cholera cases in Bangladesh—that
cholera cases occur with a rise in ocean temperature (Colwell,
1996). Two peak periods for cholera outbreaks have been iden-
tified: from early April to mid-May and from early September
to the end of November. During these periods, high sea-surface
temperature, salinity, and concentrations of nutrients probably
favor the growth of V. cholerae. Outbreaks during the monsoon
have been substantially smaller. Colwell (1996) also indicated
a possible link between outbreaks of cholera in Peru and neigh-
boring countries and a warming ENSO event. Although the
ENSO phenomenon has a substantial effect on the Indian sum-
mer monsoon, its linkage with cholera has not been investigat-
ed. Future increases in sea-surface temperature, as well as
increased concentrations of pollutants in river flows under cli-
mate change scenarios, may create a more favorable environ-
ment for the growth of V. cholerae throughout the year in the
coastal area of Bangladesh.

Manner, some simpie examples for india, Indonesia,
Malaysia, and Thailand are given in Section 6.5 of the
Working Group III contribution to the SAR (IPCC,
1996) and in ADB (1994a, 1994b). In these and other
national studies, the conclusions usually are strongly
thematic or sector-based.

Geographical Integration—Linkages between differ-
ent functional regions are difficult to investigate
although, at a conceptual level, they are readily
acknowledged. For example, drainage basins can pro-
vide functional links between climate change impacts
in headwaters and the downstream areas they affect; at
the same time, however, downstream areas also may be
responding to locally specific climate change impacts.
Some simple examples have been described in this
chapter (e.g., Section 11.3.3.3). Functional adapta-
tions—such as through total river catchment analyses
or integrated coastal management—are extraordinarily
difficult to implement because of jurisdictional sensi-
tivities, even though conceptual and methodological
hurdles may be relatively easy to overcome.

Sectoral and Trade Integration—There have been a
number of attempts to integrate the various components
of food supply (agriculture) in Tropical Asia, generally
with simplified production change models in response
to changes in environmental conditions (e.g,. tempera-
ture or precipitation and their derivatives, such as
length of growing season and time of fruiting), some
with yield adaptations and some without. These results
are then integrated into an international trade-condi-
tions model, and estimates of net economic welfare
impacts are calculated. Reilly et al. (1993) have done
this for Tropical Asia using three GCMs and 2xCO,
equilibrium scenarios.

Comprehensive Monetary Estimates—Another way of
integrating the range of potential impacts of climate
change is to derive a comprehensive monetary estimate,
which adds all of a country’s impacts, expressed in their
dollar value. Expressing damage to marketed goods and
services (e.g., land lost to sea-level rise, energy savings in
winter) in monetary terms is more or less straightforward
because the price is known. Expressing damage to non-
marketed goods and services (e.g., wetland loss, mortality
changes) in monetary terms can be done either through
examining market transactions where such goods or ser-
vices are implicitly traded (e.g., tourism, where landscape
beauty is valued) or through interviewing people to deter-
mine their preferences (i.e., their willingness to pay to
secure a benefit or their willingness to accept compensa-
tion for a loss). Such valuation techniques reflect econom-
ic circumstances and value systems in the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The
estimates for non-OECD countries in Chapter 6 of the
Working Group III contribution to the SAR (IPCC, 1996)
are based on extrapolation from studies in the OECD.
With these caveats in mind, Chapter 6 of the WG III con-
tribution to the SAR (IPCC, 1996) reports best estimates

area of circle centered in each cell; brown and blue circles

regions where a 5°x5° grid cell spanned two or more regions,
the anomalies for that grid cell were used more than once—
once for each region that intersected the grid cell. The time
series depicted in Figures A-4 through A-13 show the anom-

annual anomalies are emphasized by a smooth curve using a

"Two data sets are used to represent near-surface air temperature
change. Over land this includes a near-surface air temperature
data set developed by Jones (1994), and over the oceans a sea-
surface temperature data set developed by Folland and Parker
(1995). Both of these data sets provide the basis for calculating
global temperature change as reported in the IPCC Second
Assessment Report (1996). Parker et al. (1994) describe the
methodology used to aggregate land and ocean temperatures
for grid cells that span both regions.
"	Text
"Precipitation changes are also calculated from two data sets.
Land-surface precipitation data are derived and updated from
Hulme (1991) and from Eischeid et al. (1995); the latter is
referred to as the GHCN (version 1) data set in IPCC (1996).
Both data sets were available with a resolution of 5°x5°. Since
two data sets were used, a procedure was needed to integrate
the data. A simple equal weighting scheme was used when both
data sets had data available. For some grid cells, data were
available from only one data set, and this provided additional
coverage relative to the use of a single data set.

"In IPCC (1990) and IPCC (1992), very low confidence was
placed on the climate change scenarios produced by general
circulation model (GCM) equilibrium experiments on the sub-
continental, or regional, scale (order of 10°—107 km2). This was
mainly attributed to coarse model resolution, limitations in
model physics representations, errors in model simulation of
present-day regional climate features, and wide inter-model
range of simulated regional change scenarios. Since then, tran-
sient runs with Atmosphere-Ocean GCMs (AOGCMs) have
become available that allow a similar regional analysis. In
addition, different regionalization techniques have been devel-
oped and tested in recent years to improve the simulation of
regional climate change. This section examines regional
change scenarios produced by new coupled GCM runs.
Following the 1990 and 1992 reports, emphasis is placed on
the simulation of seasonally averaged surface air temperature
and precipitation, although the importance of higher order sta-
tistics and other surface climate variables for impact assess-
ment is recognized (Kittel et al., 1995; Mearns et al., 1995a,b).

Southern Europe (SEU; 35-50°N, 10 W- 45°E), and Australia
(AUS; 12-45°S, 110-155°E). Output from different coupled
model runs with dynamical oceans for these regions was ana-
lyzed by Cubash et al. (1994a), Whetton et al. (1996), and
Kittel et al. (1997), while analysis over the Australian region
from equilibrium simulations with mixed-layer ocean models
was performed by Whetton et al. (1994). Results over two
additional regions were analyzed by Raisanen (1995) for
Northern Europe (NEU; land areas north of 50°N and west of
60°E) and Li et al. (1994) for East Asia (EAS; 15-60°N, 70-
140°E). To summarize the findings of these works, Figure B-1
shows differences between region-average values at the time of
CO, doubling and for the control run, and differences between
control run averages and observations (hereafter referred to as
bias), for winter and summer surface air temperature and pre-
cipitation. Note that these models contain increases of CO
only. Experiments including increased CO, and the effects of
sulfate aerosols will be discussed later.

ues as extreme as ~-90% or greater than 200% [Figure B-1
(f,h)]. The biases were generally larger in winter than in sum-
mer, and, overall, regions with the smallest biases were
Southern Europe, Northern Europe, and Central North
America. Regions receiving low winter precipitation (e.g.,
Sahel, South East Asia) tended to have large positive or nega-
tive biases, because small errors in control run values appear as
large biases when reported in percentage terms.
"	Text
"The surface air temperature biases had positive and negative
values both in winter and summer [Figure B-1 (b,d)]. However,
biases were mostly negative in winter and positive in summer,
an indication that the models tended to overestimate the sea-
sonal temperature cycles. Most biases were in the range of -7
to 10°C, but values as large as ~15°C were found. The small-
est biases were found over Australia and, with the exception of
one or two models, South East Asia and Southern Europe. Over
most regions, the inter-model range of temperature biases was
of the order of 10°C (i.e., it was greater than the inter-model
range of regional temperature increase). The surface tempera-
ture biases as well as the simulated regional warming scenar-
ios were in the same range as those reported in IPCC (1990) for
a number of equilibrium runs.
"	Text
"Scenarios produced by these transient experiments varied
widely among models and from region to region, both for tem-
perature and precipitation. Except for a few outliers, individual
values of projected surface warming varied mostly in the range
of ~1 to ~5°C [Figure B-1 (a,c)]—with the NCAR(r) and
MPI(q) runs showing the least temperature sensitivity because,
with a 1% linear increase in CO,/year (Table B-1), CO, has
increased only by a factor of 1.7 by the end of the 70-year sim-
ulation, compared to a doubling for the other model runs. For
most regions, the inter-model range of simulated temperature
increase was rather pronounced, about 3-5°C. With the excep-
tion of one or two outliers, the smallest inter-model range of
simulated warming at the time of CO, doubling was over
Australia in summer and the Sahel in winter, where the scenar-
ios differed among models by no more than 1.3°C. It should be
noted, however, that for a region such as Australia continental-
scale agreement may come from canceling differences at the
sub-continental scale.

"flow (contrast this result to the experiments that include
the effects of sulfate aerosols; see discussion below in
relation to Figure B-2).

All models agreed in winter precipitation increases
over Northern Europe, East Asia, and, except for one
model, Southern Europe. In the other cases, agreement
was not found among models even on the sign of the
simulated change.

Regions with the smallest inter-model range of simu-
lated precipitation change were Central North
America, East Asia, and Northern Europe in summer
and Southern Europe, Northern Europe, and East Asia
in winter.

Overall, the precipitation biases were greater than the
simulated changes. A rigorous statistical analysis of the
model results in Figure B-1 has not been carried out;
however, it can be expected that, due to relatively high
temporal and spatial variability in precipitation, tem-
perature changes are more likely to be statistically sig-
nificant than precipitation changes.
"	List
"In summary, several instances occurred in which regional sce-
narios produced by all models agreed, at least in sign. In fact,
regardless of whether flux correction was used, the range of
model sensitivity was less than the range of biases (note that
the scales in Figure B-1 are different for the sensitivities and
the biases). However, the range of simulated scenarios of the
model regional biases were still large, so that confidence in
regional scenarios simulated by AOGCMs remains low. It
should be pointed out that, while model agreement increases
our confidence in the veracity of model responses, it does not
necessarily guarantee their correctness because of possible sys-
tematic errors or deficiencies shared by all models. On the
other hand, in spite of these errors, models are useful tools to
study climate sensitivity (see IPCC 1996, WG I, Chapter 5).
Even though models cannot exactly reproduce many details of
today’s climate, key processes that we know to exist in the real
climate system are represented in these models (see IPCC
1996, WG I, Chapter 4). For example, the simulation of the
seasonal cycle of winds, temperature, pressure, and humidity
in both the horizontal and vertical provides us with a first-order
qualification of the fidelity of the models’ ability to capture
these basic features of the Earth’s climate. As another example,
AOGCMs exhibit the ability to simulate essential responses of
the climate system to various forcings (e.g., those involving El
Nifio sea surface temperature anomalies and aerosols from vol-
canic activity). This increases our confidence in the use of
AOGCM sensitivity experiments to evaluate potential changes
in important climate processes.

few decades. Here we consider the effect of combined green-
house gas and direct sulfate aerosol forcing derived from IS92a
on simulated patterns of temperature change to 2050 and
beyond (y,z). Figure B-2 shows area averages of summer and
winter surface temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture

"6.7a of IPCC 1996, WG I). The surface temperature warms
everywhere except in the northern North Atlantic (Figure 6.7b
of IPCC 1996, WG I). In transient simulations to 2050, the
inclusion of aerosols based on IS92a (y,z) reduces the global
mean radiative forcing, and leads to negative radiative forcing
over southern Asia. This leads to a muted warming or even
small regions of cooling (y) in mid-latitudes. In (z), China con-
tinues to warm, albeit at a very reduced rate, even though the
local net radiative forcing becomes increasingly negative
(Figure 6.7c in IPCC 1996, WG I). The rate of warming over
North America and western Europe, where the aerosol forcing
weakens, remains below that in the simulation with greenhouse
gases only (w). The cooling due to aerosols is amplified by sea
ice feedbacks in the Arctic (Figure 6.7f in IPCC 1996, WG I).

"IPCC (1990) reported some broad scale changes that were evi-
dent in most of the equilibrium 2xCO, experiments that were
then available. The detailed regional changes differed from
model to model. In the transient experiments reported in IPCC
(1992), it was found that the large-scale patterns of response at
the time of doubling CO, were similar to the corresponding
equilibrium experiments (IPCC, 1990), except that there was a
smaller warming in the vicinity of the northern North Atlantic
and the Southern Ocean in transient experiments. Here we
summarize the main features in the seasonal (December to
February and June to August) patterns of change in tempera-
ture, precipitation, and soil moisture in those experiments with
a 1%/yr increase in CO, for which data were available. The
changes are assessed at the time data of CO, doubling (after 70
years). In experiments w-z, we also contrast the continental-
scale response under the IS92a scenario with and without
aerosol forcing at around 2040.

"As noted in the IPCC (1990), the following factors appear to
contribute to summer drying:
"	Text
"There is now mounting evidence to suggest that a warmer cli-
mate will be one in which the hydrological cycle will in gener-
al be more intense (IPCC, 1992), leading to more heavy rain
events (ibid, pp. 119). It should be noted, however, that as the
GCM grid sizes are much larger than convective elements in the
atmosphere, daily precipitation is poorly reproduced by GCMs.

"surface temperature (see Ingram et al., 1989). The details of
these changes are sensitive to parameterization of sea ice and,
in particular, the specification of sea ice albedo (e.g., Meehl
and Washington, 1995). In one simulation (k), there is a
marked cooling over the northeastern Atlantic throughout the
year, which leads to a cooling over part of northwest Europe
in winter. There is little seasonal variation of the warming in
low latitudes or over the southern circumpolar ocean.
"	Text
"Soil moisture may be a more relevant quantity for assessing
the impacts of changes in the hydrological cycle on vegetation
than precipitation since it incorporates the integrated effects of
changes in precipitation, evaporation, and runoff throughout
the year. However, simulated changes in soil moisture should
be viewed with caution because of the simplicity of the land-
surface parameterization schemes in current models (e.g.,
experiments a,e-i,m,n,p.g, and r use an unmodified “bucket”
formulation; see Section 5.3.2 of IPCC 1996, WG I).
"	Text
"The soil in the control simulation is close to saturation
in late winter or spring; this ensures that much of the
extra precipitation in winter is not stored in the soil but
lost as runoff.

There is a substantial seasonal variation in soil moisture
in the simulation of present climate; some of the sim-
pler models may exaggerate the seasonal cycle of soil
moisture (see Chapter 5 of IPCC 1996, WG I) leading
to an exaggerated response in the warmer climate.
"	List
"Most models produce a drier surface in summer in northern
mid-latitudes. This occurs consistently over southern Europe
(except g, which produces an excessively dry surface in winter
in its control climate) and North America (except d,k, and q).
The main factor in the drying is enhanced evaporation in sum-
mer (see Wetherald and Manabe, 1995): The absolute rate of
increase in potential evaporation increases exponentially with
temperature if other factors (wind, stability, and relative
humidity) are unchanged.
"	Text
"When aerosol effects are included (y,z cf. x,w respectively),
the maximum winter warming in high northern latitudes is
less extensive. In mid-latitudes, there are some regions of
cooling (e.g., over China), and the mean warming in the trop-
ics is greater than in mid-latitudes. In northern summer, there
are again regions of cooling in mid-latitudes and the greatest
warming now occurs over Antarctica. Again, including the
direct forcing by sulfate aerosols has a strong effect on simu-
lated regional temperature changes, though the reader should
bear in mind the limitations of these experiments as noted
earlier.
"	Text
"With the inclusion of aerosol forcing (y,z), there is only a small
increase in global mean precipitation. The patterns of change in
Precipitation in northern winter are broadly similar to that in a
parallel simulation with greenhouse gases only (x,w respec-
tively), but less intense. In northern summer, there is a net
reduction in precipitation over the Asian monsoon region
(Figure B-2), because the aerosol cooling reduces the land-sea
contrast and the strength of the monsoon flow. This is in con-
trast to the models run with CO, increase only that showed
increases of monsoon precipitation (Figure B-1). Precipitation
increases on average over southern Europe (it decreases when
aerosol effects are omitted) and over North America, where
changes were small with increases in greenhouse gases only.
"	Text
"Most models produce a general increase in soil moisture in
the mean in high northern latitudes in winter, though in some
(a,k) there are also substantial areas of reduction. The
increases are due mainly to the increased precipitation dis-
cussed above, and the increased reaction of precipitation
falling as rain in the warmer climate. At the low winter tem-
peratures, the absolute change in potential evaporation is
small, as expected from the Clausius-Clapyeron relation, so
evaporation increases little even though temperature increas-
es are a maximum in winter. Hence, the increase in soil mois-
ture in high altitudes in winter is consistent with physical rea-
soning and the broad scale changes are unlikely to be model-
dependent. However, it should be noted that in general the
models considered here do not represent the effects of freez-
ing on groundwater.
"	Text
"On increasing CO , all models produce an increase in global
mean precipitation. Precipitation increases in high latitudes in
winter (except in & around the Norwegian Sea where there is
cooling and a reduction in precipitation), and in most cases the
increases extend well into mid-latitudes (e.g., Figure 6.11a in
IPCC 1996, WG I). The warming of the atmosphere leads to
higher atmospheric water vapor content and enhanced pole-
ward water vapor transport into the northern high latitudes—
hence enhanced water vapor convergence and precipitation
(e.g., Manabe and Wetherald, 1975). In the tropics, the pat-
terns of change vary from model to model, with shifts or
changes in intensity of the main rainfall maxima. However,
many produce more rainfall over India and/or southeast Asia
as seen in Figure B-1. This is consistent with an increase in
atmospheric water vapor concentration leading to enhanced
low level moisture convergence associated with the strong
mass convergence into the monsoon surface pressure low. All
models considered apart from p and q produce a general
reduction in precipitation over southern Europe. In general,
changes in the dry subtropics are small.

been achieved in the development and testing of statistical
downscaling and regional modeling techniques for the gener-
ation of high-resolution regional climate information from
coarse-resolution GCM simulations.

"When optimally calibrated, statistical downscaling models
have been quite successful in reproducing different statistics of
local surface climatology (IPCC 1996, WG I). Limited appli-
cations of statistical downscaling models to the generation of
climate change scenarios has occurred showing that in com-
plex physiographic settings local temperature and precipitation
change scenarios generated using downscaling methods were
significantly different from, and had a finer spatial scale struc-
ture than, those directly interpolated from the driving GCMs
(IPCC 1996, WG I).
"	Text
"With aerosol forcing included (y,z), the patterns of soil moisture
change in northern winter are similar but weaker than with green-
house gas forcing only (x,w). However, soil moisture increases
over North America and southern Europe in summer when
aerosol effects are included (y,z), presumably because of the
reduced warming and its effect on evaporation, and because of
increases in precipitation. The changes in the hydrological cycle
are likely to be sensitive to the distribution of aerosol forcing and
the coupled model used. However, it is clear that aerosol effects
have a strong influence on simulated regional climate change.
"	Text
"Given the varying response of different land-surface schemes
to the same prescribed forcing (IPCC 1996, WG I, Chapter 5),
the consistency from model to model of reductions over south-
ern Europe in summer might be regarded as surprising. All
models submitted (except p,q) produced a reduction in summer
precipitation over southern Europe: Here changes in circula-
tion and precipitation may be more important in determining
soil moisture changes than the details of the land-surface
scheme. Reductions over North America are less consistent,
and there is a still wider model-to-model variation in the
Tesponse over northern Europe and northern Asia.

"The (one-way) nested modeling technique has been increasing-
ly applied to climate change studies in the last few years. This
technique consists of using output from GCM simulations to
provide initial and driving lateral meteorological boundary con-
ditions for high-resolution Regional Climate Model (RegCM)
simulations, with no feedback from the RegCM to the driving
GCM. Hence, a regional increase in resolution can be attained
through the use of nested RegCMs to account for sub-GCM
grid-scale forcings. The most relevant advance in nested region-
al climate modeling activities was the production of continuous
RegCM multi-year climate simulations. Previous regional cli-
mate change scenarios were mostly produced using samples of
month-long simulations (IPCC 1996, WG I). The primary
improvement represented by continuous long-term simulations
consists of equilibration of model climate with surface hydrol-
ogy and simulation of the full seasonal cycle for use in impact
models. In addition, the capability of producing long-term runs
facilitates the coupling of RegCMs to other regional process
models, such as lake models, dynamical sea ice models, and
possibly regional ocean (or coastal) and ecosystem models.

"Analysis of surface air temperature and precipitation results
from regional climate change experiments carried out with
AOGCMs indicates that the biases in present-day simulations
of regional climate change and the inter-model variability in the
simulated regional changes are still too large to yield a high
level of confidence in simulated change scenarios. The limited
number of experiments available with statistical downscaling
techniques and nested regional models has shown that complex
topographical features, large lake systems, and narrow land
masses not resolved at the resolution of current GCMs signifi-
cantly affect the simulated regional and local change scenarios,
both for precipitation and (to a lesser extent) temperature (IPCC
1996, WG I). This adds a further degree of uncertainty in the
use of GCM-produced scenarios for impact assessments. In
addition, most climate change experiments have not accounted
for human-induced landscape changes and only recently has the
effect of aerosols been investigated. Both these factors can fur-
ther affect projections of regional climate change.
"	Text
"For temperature, the differences between RegCM- and
GCM-simulated region-averaged change scenarios were
in the range of 0.1 to 1.4°C. For precipitation, the differ-
ences between RegCM and GCM scenarios were more
pronounced than for temperature, in some instances by
one order of magnitude or even in sign. These differ-
ences between RegCM- and GCM-produced regional
scenarios are due to the combined contributions of the
different resolution of surface forcing (e.g., topography,
lakes, coastlines) and atmospheric circulations, and in
some instances the different behavior of model parame-
terizations designed for the fine- and coarse-resolution
models. In summer, differences between RegCM and
GCM results were generally more marked than in winter
due to the greater importance of local processes.

While the simulated temperature changes obtained with
nested models were generally larger than the corre-
sponding biases, the precipitation changes were gener-
ally of the same order of, or smaller than, the precipita-
tion biases.

"Compared to the global-scale changes due to doubled CO, con-
centration, the changes at 104-10° km? scale derived from tran-
sient AOGCM runs are greater. Considering all models, at the
10106 km? scale, temperature changes due to CO, doubling
varied between 0.6 and 7°C and precipitation changes varied
between -35 and 50% of control run values, with a marked
inter-regional variability. Thus, the inherent predictability of
climate diminishes with reduction in geographical scale. The
greatest model agreement in the simulated precipitation change
scenarios was found over the South East Asia (about -1 to
30%), Northern Europe (about -9 to 16%), Central North
America (about -7 to 5%), and East Asia (about 0.1 to 16%)
regions in summer, and Southern Europe (about -2 to 29%),
Northern Europe (about 5 to 25%), and East Asia (about 0.5 to
18%) in winter. For temperature, the greatest model agreement
in simulated warming occurred over Australia in summer
(about 1.65 to 2.5°C, when excluding one outlier) and the
Sahel in winter (about 1.8 to 3.15°C, when excluding one out-
lier). Regardless of whether flux correction was used, the range
of model sensitivities was less than the range of biases, which
suggests that models produce regional sensitivities that are
more similar to each other than their biases.

"events. Averaged Over regions on the order of 104—106
km? in size, temperature biases were mostly in the
range of a few tenths of °C to a few °C, and precipita-
tion biases were mostly in the range of 10-40% of
observed values. The biases generally increased as the
size of the region decreased.

The RegCM performance was critically affected by the
quality of the driving large-scale fields, and tended to
deteriorate when the models were driven by GCM out-
put, mostly because of the poorer quality of the driving
large-scale data compared to the analysis data (e.g.,
position and intensity of storm tracks).

Compared to the driving GCMs, RegCMs generally
produced more realistic regional detail of surface cli-
mate as forced by topography, large lake systems, or
narrow land masses. However, the validation experi-
ments also showed that RegCMs can both improve and
degrade aspects of regional climate compared to the dri-
ving GCM runs, especially when regionally averaged.
Overall, the models performed better at mid-latitudes
than in tropical regions.

The RegCM performance improved as the resolution of
the driving GCM increased, mostly because the GCM
simulation of large-scale circulation patterns improved
with increasing resolution.

Seasonal as well as diurnal temperature ranges were
simulated reasonably well.

An important problem in the validation of RegCMs has
been the lack of adequately dense observational data,
since RegCMs can capture fine structure of climate pat-
terns. This problem is especially relevant in mountain-
ous areas, where only a relatively small number of
high-elevation stations are often available.

"extended to the multi-year time scale. Also, variable- and high-
resolution global models can be used to study possible feed-
backs of mesoscale forcings on general circulation.
"	Text
"Regional modeling techniques, however, rely critically on the
GCM performance in simulating large-scale circulation patterns
at the regional scale, because they are a primary input to both
empirical and physically based regional models. Although the
regional performance of coarse-resolution GCMs is still some-
what poor, there are indications that features such as position-
ing of storm track and jet stream core are better simulated as the
model resolution increases. The latest nested GCM/RegCM and
variable-resolution model experiments, which employed rela-
tively high-resolution GCMs and were run for long simulation
times (up to 10 years) show an improved level of accuracy.
Therefore, as a new generation of higher resolution GCM sim-
ulations become available, it is expected that the quality of sim-
ulations with regional and local downscaling models will also
rapidly improve. In addition, the movement towards coupling
regional atmospheric models with appropriately scaled ecolog-
ical, hydrological, and mesoscale ocean models will not only
improve the simulation of climatic sensitivity, but also provide
assessments of the joint response of the land surface, atmos-
phere, and/or coastal systems to altered forcings.

of global models were intercompared and loosely coupled for an
assessment of both model capabilities and the potential impacts
of global warming on U.S. ecosystems (VEMAP Members,

Cases producing vegetation responses of opposite sign.

"MAPSS (Mapped Atmosphere-Plant-Soil System; Neilson,
1995) and BIOME3 (Haxeltine and Prentice, 1996) are among
a new generation of process-based, equilibrium biogeographic
models (IPCC 1996, WG II, Section 1.3.4; VEMAP Members,
1995). The models simulate the distribution of potential global
vegetation based on local vegetation and hydrologic processes
and the physiologicat properties of plants. Both models simu-
late the mixture of vegetation lifeforms, such as trees, shrubs,
and grasses, that can coexist at a site while in competition with
each other for light and water. A set of physiologically-ground-
ed ‘rules’ determines whether the woody vegetation will be
broadleaved or needleleaved, or evergreen or deciduous, as
well as other properties. The models also simulate the maxi-
mum carrying capacity, or vegetation density, in the form of
leaf area that can be supported at the site, under the constraints
of energy and water. Energy constraints, largely applicable to
cold ecosystems, are prescribed in MAPSS, but are simulated
by an explicit carbon flux model in BIOME3. The two models
simulate a similar set of water balance processes, incorporating
soil texture effects.

deserts over all non-wetland sites of the Earth, based on the rel-
ative densities or productivity of overstory and understory, veg-
etation leaf characteristics and thermal tolerances. The models
simulate the distribution of generalized vegetation lifeforms
(e.g. tree, shrub, grass; evergreen-deciduous; broadleaf-needle-
leaf), rather than species and assemble these into a vegetation
type classification. There are currently 45 different vegetation
types simulated by MAPSS and 18 by BIOME3. The vegetation
types are hierarchical, representing biomes (e.g., boreal forest,
temperate savanna, grassland, etc.) at the top and more detailed
community-level descriptions at the lower end (e.g., subtropi-
cal, xeromorphic woodland). Only the top of the hierarchy is
utilized in this analysis. Since both models simulate a full site
water balance, they are also calibrated and tested hydrologic
models, thereby, allowing estimates of impacts on water
resources fully integrated with the simulated impacts on vege-
tation (Neilson and Marks, 1994; VEMAP Members, 1995). As
equilibrium models, MAPSS and BIOME3 simulate vegetation
distribution and hydrology under an average seasonal cycle of
climate. They simulate an equilibrium land-surface biosphere
under current or future climate, but not the transitional vegeta-
tion changes from one climate to another. Thus, the models

"Global vegetation models (GVM) have in the past decade
evolved from largely statistical-correlational to more process-
based, rendering greater confidence in their abilities to address
questions of global change. There are generally two classes of
GVMs, biogeography models and biogeochemistry models. The
biogeography models place emphasis on determination of what
can live where, but either do not calculate or only partially cal-
culate the cycling of carbon and nutrients within ecosystems.
The biogeochemistry models simulate the carbon and nutrient
cycles within ecosystems, but lack the ability to determine what
kind of vegetation could live at a given location. BIOME3 has
significantly blurred this model distinction (Haxeltine and
Prentice, 1996). There are over 20 biogeochemistry models and
about 5 biogeography models. Two of the biogeography models,
MAPSS (Neilson, 1995) and BIOME3 were used to provide
estimates of changes in vegetation distribution, density and
hydrology for this IPCC special report. These are equilibrium
models, which simulate the potential ‘climax’ vegetation that
could live at any well-drained, upland site in the world under an
‘average’ seasonal climate. Equilibrium models provide useful
‘snapshots’ of what a terrestrial biosphere in equilibrium with its
climate might look like, but can provide only inferential infor-
mation about how the biosphere will make transitions from one
condition to another. This is in contrast to other models, which
simulate the timeseries of vegetation change at a point (Shugart
and Smith, 1996), but which do not produce maps of vegetation
distribution and function. Fully dynamic versions of the spatial-
ly-explicit GVMs are being developed and incorporate both bio-
geography and biogeochemistry processes, but the dynamic
global vegetation models (DGVM) are not yet ready for assess-
ment purposes (Neilson and Running, 1996). Several model
intercomparison projects are underway and can serve to provide
some context for the two models used here. One such intercom-
parison is the VEMAP process.

The models are most accurate in differentiating the broad phys-
iognomic divisions of Forest, Savanna, semi-arid lands
(Shrublands and Grasslands) and Arid Lands. These differ-
ences are largely based on the relationship between leaf area
and site water balance and the simulated changes in leaf area

with respect to the sign of the change). The aggregated vegeta-

Eamus, 1996b). Unless CO, stimulates an increase in N miner-
alization (Curtis et al., 1995), productivity gains in high CO,
are likely to be constrained by the system’s N budget (Kérner,
1995). Nitrogen limitations may constrain carbon gains to struc-
tural tissue, rather than leaves (Curtis et al., 1995). Thus, in
areas receiving large amounts of N deposition, a direct CO,
response could result in large increases in leaf area, increasing
transpiration and possibly increasing sensitivity to drought via
rapid soil water depletion. Early growth increases may disap-
pear as the system approaches carrying capacity as limited by
water or nutrients (K6mer, 1995). Shifts in species composition
will likely result from different sensitivities to elevated Co,

cal model processes and not in the GCMs. There are no feed-

"The MAPSS model also contains a fire model that shifts some
vegetation to a “fire climax’ state, such as in many grasslands
or savannas. BIOME3 embeds these processes in the calibra-
tion. Neither model considers current or past land-use prac-
tices. Thus, some areas that the models indicate as grassland,
for example, might actually be shrublands, due to either graz-
ing or fire suppression. Although the two models do not simu-
late actual land-use, the ‘potential’ land-cover simulated by the
models should provide an accurate estimate of the land-surface
potential. That is, forests cannot be grown in deserts or shrub-
lands without irrigation; and, agricultural productivity should
be higher in a potential forest landscape than in a potential
shrubland landscape (given similar soils). Changes in LAI can
be interpreted as a change in the overall carrying capacity or
standing crop of the site, regardless of whether it is in potential
natural vegetation or under cultivation. Additions from irriga-
tion or nitrogen could alter this conclusion, but it should hold
for non-irrigated, upland systems. Thus, simulated changes in
potential natural vegetation should be valuable indicators of
general shifts in agricultural potential.

"MAPSS and BIOME3 contain algorithms that allow the incor-
poration of a direct physiological CO, effect. Elevated CO,
concentrations can, among other effects, enhance productivity
and increase the water-use-efficiency (WUE, carbon fixed per
unit water transpired) of the vegetation thereby reducing the
sensitivity of the vegetation to drought stress (IPCC 1996, WG
II, Section A.2.3; Bazzaz et al., 1996; Eamus, 1991). BIOME3
allows a direct CO, effect on both productivity and water-use-
efficiency. MAPSS accomplishes the same effect by reducing
stomatal conductance, which then results in increased leaf area,
thus indirectly incorporating a productivity effect. Individual
species exhibit variations in their expressions of direct CO,
effects. For example, the productivity and WUE effects are not
necessarily tightly coupled (Eamus, 1996a). However, since
the models simulate functional types, rather than species, both
models have generalized the direct CO, effects to all vegeta-
tion, with the exception in BIOMES3 of differentiating C, and
C, physiological types. In BIOME3 C, plants do not experi-
ence the elevated growth of C; plants, but do experience
increased water-use-efficiency. The realized importance of the
direct CO, processes in complex, mature ecosystems remains a
matter of debate (Bazzaz et al., 1996).

"A review of 58 studies indicated an average 32% increase in
plant dry mass under a doubling of CO, concentration
(Wullschleger, Post, and King, 1995). Norby (1996) document-
ed an average 29% increase in annual growth per unit leaf area
in seven broadleaf tree species under 2 x CO, over a wide range
of conditions. Increased WUE, examined in another review,
averaged about 30-40% as indexed by reductions in leaf con-
ductance to water vapor (Eamus, 1991). If such responses were
maintained in forests over many decades, they would imply a
substantial potential for increased storage of atmospheric car-
bon, as well as conferring some increased tolerance to drought
due to increased WUE. However, some species or ecosystems
exhibit acclimation to elevated CO, by downregulating photo-
synthesis (Bazzaz, 1990; Grulke et al., 1993; Grulke et al.,
1990); while others do not exhibit acclimation (Bazzaz, 1990;
Teskey, 1997). Most of the early CO, research was done on
juvenile trees in pots and growth chambers. New research is
beginning to emerge which focuses on larger trees or intact
forested ecosystems. Recent reviews of this newer literature
(Eamus, 1996a; Curtis, 1996) indicate that acclimation may not
be as prevalent when roots are unconstrained and also that leaf
conductance may not be reduced and that both responses are
dependent on the experimental conditions, the length of expo-
sure and the degree of nutrient or water stress. These results
imply that forests could produce more leaf area under elevated
CO}, but may not gain a benefit from increased WUE. In fact,
with increased leaf area, transpiration should increase on a per
tree basis and the stand would use more water. Elevated tem-
peratures would increase transpiration even further, perhaps
drying the soils and inducing a drought effect on the ecosystem
(ibid). Prominent among the environmental influences that are
thought to moderate long-term responses to elevated CO, is

by applying ratios ((2 x CO,)/(1 x CO,)) of all climate vari-
ables (except temperature) back to a baseline longterm average
monthly climate dataset (Leemans and Cramer, 1991). Ratios
were used to avoid negative numbers (e.g., negative precipita-

steppe and grassland are sometimes difficult to quanti-

grass and woody vegetation. The relative abundance
of the two functional types is considered in determin-

accepted rules to indicate how much woody vegetation
is sufficient to label a region a shrubland, or converse-
ly how much grass is required to label it a grassland.
Grasslands include both C; and C, grassland types in

grassland type is a ‘fire climax’ type that would be
populated by shrubs either with the absence of fire, or
with extensive grazing.

rainfall (VEMAP Members, 1995; Neilson, 1995; Neilson and
Marks, 1994) and represent a focus for future research. Other
local to regional errors in the MAPSS and BIOMES classifica-
tions will be apparent to the knowledgeable reader. Reasons for
these errors are many, but include 1) possible errors in the
interpolated climate, 2) grazing, harvest, fire and other distur-
bances, and 3) missing or weak representation of some
processes in the models. Globally, both models are reasonably
accurate and are generally considered to be more accurate
under altered climates than previous, empirical approaches
(VEMAP Members, 1995). Empirical approaches cannot
simultaneously simulate changes in vegetation distribution and
changes in vegetation density and hydrology. Nor can they
examine the sensitivity of the system to altered CO, concen-
trations. However, as the focus shifts to ever smaller regions or
locales, the model uncertainty and the likelihood of error

increases.

the two types in BIOME3 hides the observation that the two
vegetation types (as defined above) tend to change in opposite
sign with respect to area, i.e., Taiga/Tundra decreasing, Boreal
Conifer increasing. The two models are quite consistent in the
simulated response of the combined biomes (Table C-1).

"Although temperature-controlied vegetation boundaries shift
predictably in all cases, water-controlled boundaries could shift
any direction, reflecting either more or less beneficial water
status. Likewise, vegetation change does not simply consist of
shifts in the boundaries between homogeneous blocks of vege-
tation. Indeed, changes in vegetation density (via leaf area
index, LAI) may often be more informative, since changes in
LAI in water-limited areas generally indicate a change in the
site water status and carrying capacity (Tables C-2, C-3;
Figures C-6 to C-9). The change in LAI could also be taken as
an indication of what could happen in the near term, since
changes in LAI can occur in a matter of a few years while
adjustments of vegetation structure and composition take much
longer.

"ple, within the U.S., when not including a direct CO, effect
(Figure C-9), both models indicate increases in LAI in the
Southwest and either an increase or no change in LAI over
most of the eastern U.S. Both models simulate a decline or no
change (BIOME3) over much of the western U.S. (excluding
the SW). Both models produce increases in LAI over parts of
the Sahara/Sahel, either with or without the direct CO, effect
under all scenarios, both old and new. Likewise, both models
under all scenarios indicate some increases in LAI over much
of the arid interior of Australia. In general, there appear to be
increases in LAI in already low LAI regions, either arid or
cold. The increases in cold regions are due to expansion of
forests into non-forested areas. The increases in arid areas are
due to increased rainfall, a consequence of a generally more
vigorous hydrologic cycle. There are many other consistencies
between the two biogeography models with respect to the rel-
ative regional or subregional simulated LAI changes. A more
complete discussion of simulated LAI patterns from the
VEMAP models over the conterminous U.S. is in preparation.

diate with large regional contrasts, decreases in vegetation den-
sity in some areas, increases in others. Even though these are
equilibrium simulations, a simulated decline in LAI generally
implies a less favorable water balance and a loss of vegetation
density. These losses imply a process of loss over some time
period. We can only draw inferences about how rapidly such
losses would occur, based on the simulated amount of loss. The
regions that could experience declining LAI (Figures C-6 to C-
9), would exhibit spatial gradients in response from mild
decline grading into potentially catastrophic dieback. All
teaches along the decline gradients would experience drought
stress, which could trigger other responses, such as pest infes-
tations and fire. Following disturbance by drought, infestation
or pests, new vegetation, either of the same or of a different
type would grow, but to a lower density.

process and a function of the product of LAI and stomatal con-

are included (MAPSS simulations, Figure C-6, OSU and

narios, if a direct CO, effect is assumed, then there are very few
regions with declines in LAI, as simulated by both MAPSS and
BIOME3 (Figures C-7, C-8); rather, most of the world is simu-
lated with an increased LAI. Actual increases in LAI could be
limited by nitrogen availability in some areas, although elevat-
ed soil temperatures could increase decomposition, releasing
more nitrogen (McGuire et al., 1995, VEMAP Members, 1995).
The first-order differences between the older and newer scenar-
ios are likely due to the smaller global temperature increases in
the newer climate scenarios, which came from GCMs that had
not attained their full equilibrium temperature changes.

"obvious differences between MAPSS and BIOME3 can be
attributed to structural differences in the models. BIOME3 cal-
culates water balance daily, even though all inputs are month-
ly; whereas, MAPSS calculates water balance monthly. This
difference alone could be causing the more extreme respon-
siveness of MAPSS, which shows both larger runoff increases
and larger losses in different regions. On the other hand,
MAPSS uses a 3-layer soil with roots only in the top two lay-
ers; while BIOME3 uses a 2-layer soil with roots in both lay-
ers. The third layer in MAPSS provides a consistent base flow
and might explain why MAPSS produces runoff in some drier
regions, such as the western U.S., while BIOME3 does not.
The hydrology models in both MAPSS and BIOME3, although
process-based, are considered prototypes for eventual replace-
ment by more elaborate models (see for example, the PILPS

"Runoff generally increases in the Tundra, due to higher tem-
peratures, more precipitation and more melting (Tables C-4,
C-5). It decreases in the Taiga/Tundra due to encroachment of
high-density boreal forest into low density vegetation (hence,
higher transpiration). Runoff results are varied in the temper-
ate forests, but Temperate Mixed forests tend to present a
higher likelihood of reduced runoff over large areas (range
51% to 88% of the area under all scenarios) than of increased
runoff (range 11% to 47% of the area under all scenarios,
Tables C-4, C-5). Even the most benign scenarios indicate a
minimum of 51% of the area of the world’s temperate ever-
green forests could experience a runoff decline; whereas, a
maximum of 47% of the area would experience increased
runoff. Temperate Evergreen Forests exhibit a greater likeli-
hood of increased runoff over large areas (range 29% to 87%
of the area under all scenarios) than decreased runoff (range

"Although many of the simulations from both MAPSS and
BIOME3 indicate potentially large expansions of tropical and in
some cases temperate forests, actual expansions would be limit-
ed by urban and agricultural land-use constraints, unsuitable
soils in some areas and slow dispersal rates, among other factors.
Even so, if a forest is anticipated to expand into a region for-
merly indicated as shrubland, any agriculture in the region might
expect an increase in potential productivity, and vice versa. Such
changes between forest and shrubland are usually underlain by a
change in LAI, which reflects the site water balance. An increase
or decrease in LAI indicates a change in the water or energy bal-
ance and the potential biomass density or carrying capacity that
could be supported on the site, regardless of whether the biomass
is ‘natural’ or agricultural (dryland agriculture only).
"	Text
"The results presented here are for steady-state, or equilibrium
conditions and do not directly indicate how the systems would
behave in their transient responses toward a new equilibrium.
For example, in areas where LAI is indicated to decline, it may
be that equilibrium runoff is indicated to increase. However, one
hypothesis is that during the processes of LAI decline, increased
evaporative demand could cause reductions in runoff, before the
vegetation becomes sufficiently drought-stressed for the LAI to
be reduced. After further time, if the vegetation is sufficiently
drought stressed, a rapid dieback could occur and might be facil-
itated by pests and fire. Were vegetation to undergo such a large
dieback, then transpiration demand would be temporarily
reduced and runoff could increase substantially. Thus, before a
new equilibrium is attained with new vegetation growth, streams
could go through a dry to wet oscillation. These possible hydro-
logic responses to vegetation change are, however, of a different
timeframe (years) than possible short term floods and droughts
that could occur simply due to increased variation of extreme
weather events (IPCC 1996, WG I, Section 6).
