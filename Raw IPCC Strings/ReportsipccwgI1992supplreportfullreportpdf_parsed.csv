"The above conclusions have implications for future
projections of global warming and somewhat modify the
estimated rate of warming of 0.3°C per decade for the
greenhouse gas emissions Scenario A of the IPCC 1990
Report. If sulphur emissions continue to increase, this
warming rate is likely to be reduced, significantly in the
Northern Hemisphere, by an amount dependent on the
future magnitude and regional distribution of the
emissions. Because sulphate aerosols are very short-lived
in the atmosphere, their effect on global warming rapidly
adjusts to increases or decreases in emissions. Jt should
also be noted that while partially offsetting the greenhouse
warming, the sulphur emissions are also responsible for
acid rain and other environmental effects. There is a
further small net reduction likely in the rate of global
warming during the next few decades due to decreases in
stratospheric ozone, partially offset by increases in

"has warmed over recent decades. Since meaningful
trends cannot be assessed over periods as short as a
decade, the widely reported disagreements between
decadal trends of air temperature from satellite and
surface data cannot be confirmed because the trends
are statistically indistinguishable.

The volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 is
expected to lead to transitory stratospheric warming.
With less certainty, because of other natural influ-
ences, surface and tropospheric cooling may occur
during the next few years.

Average warming over the Northern Hemisphere
during the last four decades has not been uniform,
with marked seasonal and geographic variations; this
warming has been especially slow, or absent, over
the extratropical north west Atlantic.

The consistency between observations of global
temperature changes over the past century and model
simulations of the warming due to greenhouse gases
over the same period is improved if allowance is
made for the increasing evidence of a cooling effect
due to sulphate aerosols and stratospheric ozone
depletion.

"Climate models have continued to improve in respect
of both their physical realism and their ability to
simulate present climate on large scales, and new
techniques are being developed for the simulation of
regional climate.

Transient (time-dependent) simulations with coupled
ocean-atmosphere models (CGCMs), in which
neither aerosols nor ozone changes have been
included, suggest a rate of global warming that is
consistent, within the range of uncertainties, with the
0.3°C per decade warming rate quoted by IPCC
(1990) for Scenario A of greenhouse gas emissions.
The large-scale geographical patterns of warming
produced by the transient model runs with CGCMs
are generally similar to the patterns produced by the
earlier cquilibrium models except that the transient
simulations show reduced warming over the northern
North Atlantic and the southern occans near
Antarctica.

CGCMs are capable of reproducing some features of
atmosphetic variability on intra-decadal time-scales.
Qur understanding of some climate feedbacks and
their incorporation in the models has improved. In
particular, there has been some clarification of the
role of upper tropospheric water vapour. The role of
other processes, in particular cloud effects, remains
unresolved.

The Earth absorbs radiation from the Sun, mainly at the surface. ‘his energy is then redistributed by the atmosphere and ocean and
re-radiated to space at longer (‘thermal’, ‘terrestrial’ or ‘infrared’) wavelengths. Some of the thermal radiation is absorbed by
radiatively-active (‘greenhouse’) gases in the atmosphere, principally water vapour, but also carbon dioxide, methane, the CFCs,
ozone and other greenhouse gases. The absorbed energy is re-radiated in all directions, downwards as well as upwards such that the
radiation that is eventually lost to space is from higher, colder levels in (he atmosphere (see diagram below). The result is that the
surface loses less heat to space than it would do in the absence of the greenhouse gases and consequently stays warmer than it would
otherwise be. This phenomenon, which acts rather like a ‘blanket’ around the Marth, is known as the greenhouse effect.

The Sun’s output of cnergy is known to change by small amounts over an [1-year cycle, and variations over longer periods may
oceur. On time-scales of tens to thousands of years, slow variations in the Earth's orbit have led to changes in the seasonal and
latitudinal distribution of solar radiation: these changes have played an important part in controlling the variations of past climate.

Increases in the concentration of the greenhouse gases will reduce the efficiency with which the Earth cools to space and will tend
to warm the lower atmosphere and surface. ‘The amount of warming depends on the size of the increase in concentration of cach
grecnhouse gas, the radiative properties of the gases involved, and the concentration of other greenhouse gases already present in the
atmosphere. It also can depend on local effects such as the variation with height of the concentration of the greenhouse gas, a
consideration that may be particularly germane to water vapour which is not uniformly mixed throughout the atmosphere. The effect
is not a simple one and the balance which is struck between these factors depends on many aspects of the climate system.

Aerosols (small particles) from volcanoes, emissions of sulphates trom industry and other sources can absorb and reflect radiation
Moreover, changes in aerosol concentrations can alter cloud reflectivity through their effect on cloud properties. In most cases
aerosols tend to cool climate. In general, they have a much shorter lifetime than greenhouse gas

Ozone (O34) is an effective greenhouse gas both in the

have been observed during the last one to two decades in
total column Oz at all latitudes - except the tropics - in
spring, summer and winter. The downward trends were

have occurred predominantly in the lower stratosphere

evidence to indicate that O3 levels in the troposphere up to
10km altitude above the few existing ozonesonde stations

The direct net flux of CO, from land-use changes
(primarily deforestation), integrated over time, depends
upon the area of land deforested, the rate of reforestation
and afforestation, the carbon density of the original and
replacement forests, and the fate of above-ground and soil
carbon, These and other factors are needed to estimate
annual net emissions but significant uncertainties exist in
out quantitative knowledge of them. Since IPCC (1990)
some progress has been made in reducing the uncertainties
associated with the rate of deforestation, at least in Brazil.
A comprehensive, multi-year, high spatial resolution
satellite data set has been used to estimate that the average
rate of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazonian forest
between 1978 and 1989 was 2.1 million hectares (Mha)
per year. The rate increased between 1978 and the mid-
1980s, and has decreased to 1.4 Mha/yr in 1990, The Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAQ), using information
supplied by individual countries, recently estimated that
the rate of global tropical deforestation in closed and open
canopy forests for the period 1981-1990 was about 17
Mha/yr, approximately 50% higher than in the period
1976-1980.

uncertainties in accurately quantifying the magnitude of
emissions from individual sources. Significant new
information includes a revised rate of removal of CH, by
atmospheric hydroxyl (OH) radicals (because of a lower
rate constant), a new evaluation of some of the sources
(c.g., from rice fields) and the addition of new sources
(c.g., animal and domestic waste). Recent CH isotopic
studies suggest that approximately 100Tg CIL, (20% of the
total CH, source) is of fossil origin, largely from the coal,
oil, and natural gas industries. Recent studies of CH,
emissions from rice agriculture, in particular Japan, India,
Australia, Thailand and China, show that the emissions
depend on growing conditions, particularly soil
characteristics, and vary significantly. While the overall

Current tropospheric models exhibit substantial differences
in their predictions of changes in Og, in the hydroxyl

emissions of CHy, non-methane hydrocarbons, CO and, in

knowledge of background chemical composition and from
our inability to represent small-scale processes occurring

accuracy of predicted changes in the abundance and
distribution of tropospheric O3, and in the lifetimes of a
number of other greenhouse gases, including the HCFCs
and HFCs, all of which depend upon the abundance of the
OH radical. Increases in CHy, NMHCs, and CO all lead to
increases in Oz, and decreases in OH, thus leading to an
increase in radiative forcing. On the other hand, because
increases in NO, lead to an increase in both O and OH,
the net effect of NO, on radiative forcing is uncertain.

greenhouse gas; indirect forcing occurs when chemical
transformation of the original gas produces a gas or gases
which themselves are greenhouse gases. The concept of
the Global Warming Potential (GWP) has been developed
for policymakers as a measure of the possible warming
effect on the surface-troposphere system arising from the
emission of each gas relative to CO. The indices are
calculated for the contemporary atmosphere and do not
take into account possible changes in chemical
composition of the atmosphere. Changes in radiative
forcing due to CO, are non-linear with changes in the
atmospheric CO, concentrations. Hence, as CO, levels

At the time of the 1990 IPCC Report it was recognized that sulphate aerosols exert a significant negative radiative
forcing on climate but this forcing was not well quantified. Since then progress has been made in understanding radiative forcing
by sulphate aerosols, and an additional source of negative forcing has been identificd in the depletion of stratospheric ozone due
to halocarbons, The lack of these negative forcing factors in GCMs docs nol negate the results obtained from them so far. For
example the estimates of climate sensitivity, which is defined purely in terms of CO, concentrations, are unchanged, and it is still
believed that anthropogenic greenhouse gases, now and even more so in the future, represent the largest perturbation to the natural
radiative balance of the atmusphere. However, it does mean that the rates of change of, say, surface temperature do need to be
adjusted for additional forcing factors before they can fulfil condition (a). The second condition is fulfilled when we use a specific

A notable feature over considerable areas of the
continental land masses of the Northern Hemisphere is that
warming over the last few decades is primarily due to an
increase of night-time rather than daytime temperatures.
These changes appear to be partly related to increases in
cloudiness but other factors cannot be excluded such as a
direct cooling cffect of aerosols on maximum temperatures
in sunny weather, an influence of increasing concen-
trations of greenhouse gases and some residual influence
of urbanization on minimum temperatures. A more
complete study is needed as only 25% of the global land
area has been analysed. In this regard, regional changes in
maximum, minimum and mean temperature related to
changes in land use (e.g., desertification, deforestation or
widespread irrigation) may need to be identified
separately.

"New IPCC 1992 emissions scenarios (IS92a-f; see
Section 4) have been derived in the light of new
information and international agreements. In order to
provide an initial assessment of the effect of the new
scenarios, the change in surface temperature has been
estimated with the simple climate model used in the IPCC
1990 report which has been calibrated against the more
comprehensive coupled ocean-atmosphere models (sce
page 16 for a description of models). These calculations
include, in the same way as did the 1990 calculations, the
direct radiative forcing effects of all the greenhouse gases
included in the scenarios. The effect of stratospheric ozone
depletion and of sulphate acrosols have nol been included,
which again parallels the 1990 calculations. Figure 2 (see
page 18) shows (a) the temporal evolution of surface
temperature for [S92a, assuming the high, “best estimate”
and low climate sensitivities (4.5, 2.5 and 1.5°C), and (b)
the temperature changes for the six 1992 IPCC scenarios

al., 1989), that depends on the distribution of both
emissions from fossil fuel combustion and the distribution
of terrestrial and oceanic sources and sinks (IPCC, 1990).
The gradient implies a continuous flux of CO, from the
Northern Hemisphere, where about 90% of the fossil fuel
emissions occur, lo the Southern Hemisphere, where part
of the net uptake by the oceans takes place. The
concentrations of CO, and its stable isotope 13C0, show
clearly that the wide and regular seasonal variability at
most stations, with substantially higher amplitudes in the
Northern Hemisphere, is dominated by the activily of the
terrestrial biosphere in the Northern Hemisphere, rather

than by seasonal changes in ocean pCO, or fossil sources.

"Al.2.3.2.1 Recent estimates of deforestation rates

The increase in Houghton’s net flux estimate was
primarily due to the use of Myers’ (1989) new estimate of
global deforestation in closed canopy forests in the late
1980s (13.9 Mha/yr for 1989), which is 90% higher than
the earlier estimate (Myers, 1980) of 7.3 Mha/yr for the
late 1970s. In addition, the World Resources Institute
(WRI, 1990) estimated global deforestation in closed
canopy forests in the late 1980s at 16.5 Mha/yr, and there
is a preliminary estimate of 14.0 Mha/yr during the 1980s
by FAO (1990, 1991) based on country estimates. The
Myers (1989) value assumed that the rate of deforestation
in Brazil was 5.0 Mha/yr, while the WRI (1990) value
assumed a rate of deforestation in Brazil of 8.0 Mha/yr.
The assumed rates of deforestation in Brazil were based on
work of Setzer and Pereira (1991), who used saturated
thermal infrared AVHRR Channel 3 data to estimate the
rate of deforestation in 1987 (8.0 Mha/yr) and 1988 (5.0
Mha/yr). However, the results of Setzer and Pereira (1991)
are now thought to be incorrect (Fearnside e¢ al., 1990)
because of inadequate spatial resolution, and questionable
assumptions about the relationship between the rate of
forest clearing and the incidence of fires. Fearnside ef al.,
(1990) used comprehensive LANDSAT high-spatial
resolution data sets from 1978, 1987, 1988, and 1989 to
estimate that the mean rate of deforestation in the Brazilian
Amazonian forest was 2.1 Mha/yr between 1978 and 1989,
and that the rate from 1987 (1/3 data)/1988 (2/3 data) to
1989 was 1.9 Mha/yr. INPE (1991) has recently included
data for 1990 and concluded that the rate of deforestation
from 1989 to 1990 was 1.4 Mha/yr. It appears that the rate

increased during the early part of the decade, peaked in the

Estimates of the strength of the ocean sink depend on air-

temperature, the difference in the partial pressure of CO,
between the water and the air (~pCO,), and on the initial

Critical variables to take into account for calculating the

among CO,, CO und CHy include the relative contribution
of above-ground and below-ground carbon; the distri-
bution between immediate releases and the effects of
deforestation on the processes controlling the subsequent
fluxes of carbon; the fate of deforested land; and the final
carbon density of the land compared to its original carbon
density. Several of these factors are poorly known locally,
and depend on the sampling methods used, For example,
carbon density values based on ecological data from small
plots generally provide higher estimates than those from
forest inventories (€.g., 328 Mg biomass/ha versus 175
Mg/ha for tropical closed forests, Brown and Lugo, 1984).
All the factors are poorly known globally. Such problems
must be reconciled in order to make reasonable estimates
on global scales (Brown and Lugo, 1991).

Fertilization of the northern temperate latitudes through
increased N deposition due to air pollution and increased
fertilizer use is possibly of sufficient magnitude to
sequester an additional 1.0 GtC/yr during the decade of the
1980s (IPCC, 1990; Thornley ez al., 1991). However, the
N deposition data are poorly known, and the extent of any
increase in growth rates of forests and grasslands must be
weighed against the possibility of other pollutants
adversely affecting physiological processes, either directly
(e.g., O pollution) or indirectly (acid deposition affecting
soil nutrients over decades). The possible adverse effects,
while suspected to be important on regional scales in
eastern North America and Europe, are insufficiently

the northern sink of carbon between land and ocean, based

its rate of accumulation in the atmosphere. Although the
emission rates from most of the individual sources are still
quite uncertain, there is a fairly good balance between the
sum of the individual sources and the deduced global
emission rate. The natural and anthropogenic sources of
CHg were discussed in detail in IPCC (1990), and in most

shows that anthropogenic sources dominate (~2:1) over
natural sources, consistent with a more than doubling of

lifetime for CH4 of 11.k (41.4, -1.1) years and a net CHy

The Prinn et al. (1992) estimate of lifetime, and hence of
source strength, includes both tropospheric and
stratospheric chemical removal. The annual magnitude of
an additional sink, i.e., uptake by soils, has been estimated
to be 30415 TgCH, (IPCC, 1990; Whalen and Reeburg,

changes in land use (Keller e¢ al., 1990; Scharffe et al.,

1991) are decreasing the CH, uptake by soils. While the
current magnitude of the soil sink is relatively small, the
importance of this sink may change in the future if changes

from termites was scaled down to 20Tg. Carbon-13 studies

"Thus, about 20% (100Tg) of total annual CH, emissions
are from fossil carbon sources, primarily coal-mining
operations, and oil and natural gas production,
transmission, distribution and use. A very small part of this
may also be due to release of old CH, from hydrate
destabilization (0-5Tg), and a warmer climate could lead to
2 significant increase in the magnitude of this source. The
latest estimates of global annual emissions for coal-mining
range from 25 to 47Tg (Okken and Kran, 1989; Barns and
Edmonds, 1990; Boyer ef al., 1990; Hargraves, 1990); for
the gas industry from 25 to 42Tg (Okken and Kran, 1989;
Barns and Edmonds, 1990); and for the oil industry from 5
to 301g (Okken and Kran, 1989). Emissions trom these

The 1990 IPCC estimate of the CH, flux from rice
paddies was based on a very limited amount of data. Table
Al.4 summarizes CII, emission rates from rice cultivation,
including a substantial amount of new information from
Japan, Australia, Thailand and, in particular, India and
China. Very large variations in emissions are observed
between different rice paddies. These differences are
probably due to several factors including irrigation and
fertilization practices, soil/paddy characteristics
(particularly redox potential), culdivation history,
temperature, and season. While WMO (1992) decided to
retain the same quantitative emission estimate of 100Tg as
IPCC (1990), a detailed analysis of the available data,
particularly that from India, suggests a global annual
emission nearer the lower end of the range.

The weight of evidence suggests that the observed middle-
and high-latitude O3 losses are largely due to chlorine and
bromine, Therefore, as the atmospheric abundances of
chlorine and bromine increase in the future, significant
additional losses of O3 are expected. Even if the control
measures of the amended Montreal Protocol (London,
1990) were to be implemented by all nations, the current
abundance of stratospheric chlorine (3.3-3.5 ppbv) is
estimated to increase during the next decade, reaching a
peak of about 4.1 ppbv around the turn of the century.
With these increases, additional middle-latitude O losses
during the 1990s are expected to be comparable to those
observed during the 1980s. Hence, by the year 2000 O3
depletions are expected to be about 6% in summer and
about 10% in winter. In addition, there is the possibility of
incurring widespread losses in the Arctic. Enhanced levels
of stratospheric sulphate aerosols from natural (e.g., Mt.
Pinatubo) or anthropogenic sources could possibly lead to
even greater ozone losses by increasing the catalytic
efficiency of chlorine- and bromine-containing chemicals
through heterogeneous chemical processes.

magnitude of ozone changes are predicted to exhibit
marked variations with latitude, altitude and season.
Differences between model calculations of O3 increases
from NO, emissions are large (factor of ~3), but moderate
from CH4 emissions (~50%). The differences in the
predicted spatial and temporal distributions of O3 changes
are particularly large for NO, emissions but again
moderate for CH, emissions. It should also be noted that
increases in CHy, CO and NMHC emissions lead to
reduced OH values, while increased NO, emiss

enhanced OH levels. As a result of these opposing effects,
the sign of future OH changes cannot be predicted reliably.

Oxidation of SO, to aerosol sulphate occurs in the gas
phase and in cloud droplets (aqueous-phase oxidation).
The former may generate new particles or the newly
formed H,SO, may add to existing particles increasing
their mass but not their number. Aqueous-phase oxidation
does not result in new particle formation but only adds to
the mass of sulphate. The dissolved sulphate may remain
in the atmosphere as an aerosol particle upon cloud droplet
evaporation (this appears to be the more frequent situation)
or may be removed from the atmosphere in precipitation.
The rates of these atmospheric oxidation reactions depend
on the concentrations of OH for the gas-phase reaction and
of oxidants (hydrogen peroxide (HO) and O3) for the
aqueous-phase reactions. The rates of the aqucous-phase
reactions increase with cloud liquid-water content, increase
with decreasing temperature, as a conscquence of
temperature dependent gas solubilities, and for the O4
reaction, decrease with decreasing cloud water pH. The
decrease in pH as the reaction proceeds can lead to a self
limitation of that reaction. While the extent of the H,O,
oxidation may be limited by the amount of H,O, present,
the amount of O3 is rarely limiting to the extent of
oxidation by that species. Detailed description of the rate,
extent and spatial distribution of these reactions depends
on knowledge of the concentrations of the reagent species
and, in the case of the aqueous-phase reactions, of the
pertinent cloud properties.

The atmospheric lifetimes of SO, DMS and hydrogen
sulphide (HS) are a few weeks at most, and their
atmospheric distributions are largely controlled by the
distributions of their sources. The mean residence time of
sulphate aerosols formed by gas-particle conversion in the
troposphere is about a week. Two consequences of the
short lifetimes are that the resulting distribution of
tropospheric aerosols is inhomogeneous, and that these
gases are not significant contributors to the stratospheric
sulphate layer. To assess the climatic impact of these
aerosols it is necessary to know their spatial distribution in
much more detail than is the case for the longer-lived
greenhouse gases, (a) because the radiative forcing due to
acrosols varies spatially, (b) because cloud microphysical
processes are nonlinear in the concentration of aerosol
particles, and (c) because cloud forcing is nonlinear in the

"Removal of submicrometer aerosol particles contributing
to the radiative effects occurs largely by the precipitation
process (e.g., Slinn, 1983). These particles are the
dominant particles on which cloud particles form (cloud

diameter of a few up to 20 micrometres) is formed, it is
much more susceptible to scavenging and removal in
precipitation than is the original submicrometre particle.
The fraction of aerosol particles incorporated in cloud
droplets on cloud formation is the subject of active current
research. Earlicr work has yielded a fairly wide spread in
this fractional incorporation, based in part on limitations of
then-existing techniques and in part on the absence of a
single definition of incorporation efficiency (ten Brink et
al., 1987). More recent work indicates a high fractional

The direct components of the GWPs have been recalculated,
taking into account revised estimated lifetimes, for a set of time

 

horizons ranging from 20 to 500 years, with CO as the reference
gas, The same ocean-atmosphere carbon cycle model as used in
IPCC (1990) has been used to relate CO, emission to
concentrations. While in most cases the values are similar 10 the
previous IPCC (1990) values, the GWPs for some of the
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons
(HFCs) have increased by 20 to 50% because of revised estimates
of their lifetimes. The direct GWP of methane (CH4) has been
adjusted upward, correcting an error in the previous IPCC report.
The carbon cycle model used in these calculations probably
underestimates both the direct and indirect GWP values for all
non-CO, gases. The magnitude of the bias depends on the
atmospheric lifetime of the gas, and the GWP time horizon.

"Gases can exert a radiative forcing both directly and indirectly:
direct forcing occurs when the gas itself is a greenhouse gas;
indirect forcing occurs when chemical transformation of the
original gas produces a gas or gases which themselves are
greenhouse gases. The concept of the Global Warming Potential
(GWP) has been developed for policymakers as a measure of the
possible warming effect on the surface-troposphere system
arising from the emission of cach gas relative to carbon dioxide
(CO9). The indices are calculated for the contemporary
atmosphere and do not take into account possible changes in
chemical composition of the atmosphere. Changes in radiative
forcing due to CO2 are highly non-lincar with respect to changes
in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Hence, as CO} levels
increase from present values, the GWPs of the non-CQ, gases
would be higher than those evaluated here. For the concept to be
most useful, both the direct and indirect components of the GWP

Given the conceptual framework of the GWP and its
implications for policy-making, the choice of a reference
molecule is dictated by the need to evaluate the results in
terms of the dominant contributor in the greenhouse gas
problem. IPCC (1990) therefore chose CO, as the
reference gas for the determination of GWPs. Although
another gas or surrogate would have a simpler atmospheric
decay behaviour compared to CO) (e.g., CFCs; see Fisher
et al., 1990), the evaluation of GWPs presented here
continues, after extensive review, to use CO, as the

Because greenhouse gases have a variety of removal
mechanisms they have different residence times, or
lifetimes, in the atmosphere. The calculated value of GWP
thus depends on the integration period chosen. There is no
single value of integration time for determining GWPs that
is ideal over the range of uses of this concept, though the
choice of a time-scale for integration in the GWP
calculation need not be totally arbitrary (see IPCC (1990)
and WMO (1992) for a discussion on the choice of time
horizons). In this report, GWPs are calculated over time
horizons of 20, 100 and 500 years (as employed in IPCC,
1990). It is believed that these three time horizons provide
a practical range for policy applications.

appropriate for well-mixed gases in the troposphere
(c.g., CO, CHy, nitrous oxide (N20) and halo-
carbons). The radiative forcing employed in the
determination of GWPs does not purport to
characterize the latitudinal and seasonal dependence
of the change in the surface-troposphere radiative
fluxes. Different well-mixed gases can yield
different spatial patterns of radiative forcings (Wang
et al., 1991);

the GWP definition used here considers only the
surface-troposphere radiative forcing rather than a
particular response (e.g., surface temperature) of the
climate system. While the surface-troposphere
radiative flux perturbations can be related to
temperature changes at the surface in the context of
one-dimensional radiative-convective models
(WMO, 1986), such a general interpretation for the
temperature response either in three-dimensional
General Circulation Models or in the actual surface-
atmosphere system must be approached with caution.
Further, although the GWP of a well-mixed gas can
be regarded as a first-order indicator of the potential
global mean temperature change due to that gas
relative to COy, it is inappropriate for predicting or
interpreting regional climate responses;

GWP values are sensitive to uncertainties regarding
atmospheric residence times. Thus, revisions to
GWP values should be expected as scientific
understanding improves. Because CO) is used as the
reference gas, any revision to the calculation of its
integrated radiative forcing over time will change all
GWP values. GWP results are also sensitive to the
choice of carbon cycle model used to calculate the
time-integrated radiative forcing for CQ,. In
particular, because the Siegenthaler-Oeschger model
has only an ocean CO, sink, it is likely to
overestimate the concentration changes and to lead
to an underestimate of both the direct and the
indirect GWPs. The magnitude of this bias depends
on the atmospheric lifctime of the gas, and the time
horizon;

as defined here, GWPs assume constant
concentration backgrounds at current levels. The
calculated GWPs depend on the assumed
background level(s). The indices are calculated for
the contemporary atmosphere and do not take into
account possible changes in the chemical
composition of the atmosphere. Changes in radiative
forcing due to CO), CH4 and N,O concentration
changes are non-linear with respect to these changes.
The net effect of these non-linearitics is such that, as
CO, levels increase from present values, the GWPs
of all non-CO, gases would become higher than
those evaluated here (see WMO, 1992):

There have been statistically significant losses of ozone in
the middle and high latitudes between 1979 and 1990
which have important ramifications for radiative forcing

TOMS satellite data (Stolarski ef a/., 1991) point to a
reduction in the column ozone, while the SAGE satellite
data (McCormick et al., 1992) and the ozonesonde data
(Stachclin and Schmid, 1991) indicate that these losses
have occurred mainly below 25km in the lower
stratosphere. The weight of evidence suggests that these
losses, both in the polar and the middle latitudes, are due in
large part to the anthropogenic emissions of CFCs, as well
as to other chlorine- and bromine-containing compounds

Because of our incomplete understanding of chemical
processes, and their latitudinal and temporal dependence, it
is not possible to quantify accurately the indirect GWPs.
As noted above, the indirect GWPs reported in IPCC
(1990) are likely to be in error and should not be used. In
particular, the value for NO, was probably overestimated
by a substantial amount (Johnson er a/., 1992). Although
we are not yet in a position to calculate new indirect
GWPs, we can estimate the sign most likely for some
compounds based on current understanding (see Table
A2.1). For example, the indirect GWP for methane is
positive and could be comparable in magnitude to the
direct value, Because the weight of evidence suggests that
halocarbons are largely responsible for the observed global
stratospheric ozone loss over the past decade (WMO,
1992), chlorine- and bromine-containing compounds are
likely to have negative indirect values. Although CO, is
not itself involved in chemical reactions affecting the
concentrations of radiatively active species, it could affect
chemical processes through its influences on the
atmospheric thermal structure. Other compounds such as
CO, NMHC and NO, indirectly affect the radiative
balance of the atmosphere through changes in tropospheric
ozone and OH (see Section A2.5). Kor such short-lived
gases, however, the GWP concept may have litte practical
applicability.

"() for the GWP concept to be most useful, both the
direct and the indirect components need to be

indirect effects are more difficult to obtain than those
for the direct effects for the following reasons:

(i) there are uncertainties in the details of the
chemical processes as well as in the spatial and
temporal variations of species involved in such
transformations. As shown later, there is fair
confidence in the sign of some of the indirect
effects; however, precise estimates are lacking.
Because of our incomplete understanding of
chemical processes, it is now recognized that
the uncertainties in the indirect components of
GWPs reported in IPCC (1990) are so large that
their use can no longer be recommended;

tropospheric ozone precursors), the GWP

been applied to gases with perturbations only in
the longwave spectra, it may not adequately
account for the seasonally and latitudinally
varying radiative effects due to inhomo-

The lifetimes of the various species are not as precisely known as the Table indicates; they are used for the GWP calculations
primarily to ensure consistency with the lifetime values in the references cited.

This assessment does nat calculate the “Total” (direct + indirect) GWP as did IPCC (1990). Note that CO. NMHC and NO, are all
short-lived gases having a negligible direct GWP component.

The indirect GWPs are uncertain but could conceivably be comparable in magnitude to the direct GWPs. Only the signs of the
indirect effects are estimated here, based on current understanding. The estimates of the indirect effects for the chlorine- and
bromine-containing compounds are based on the weight of evidence related to the observed lower stratospheric ozone depletion
(WMO, 1992).

IPCC (1990) contained a typographical error for the indirect effect of methane which led to the inference of an incorrect value for
its direct GWP. Also in that report, the indirect effect of NO, was probably overestimated by a large factor (Johnson et al., 1992).

Two sets of radiative transfer modelling studies (WMO,

different assumptions about the vertical profile of the
lower stratospheric ozone loss over the past decade, have
been performed and lead to similar conclusions. They
suggest an enhancement of the ozone-induced longwave
effects (effects b and c) over the solar (effect a) in the
middle to high tatitudes, corresponding to the larger ozone
losses there. Because of the spatial variability in the ozone
depletions and the presence of the solar component, the
calculated azone forcing depends on the season and the

influence on the ozone radiative forcing is the
meteorological state of the troposphere, particularly the
distribution of clouds (WMO, 1992).

The weight of evidence suggests that the observed
stratospheric ozone losses are due to heterogencous
chemical reactions involving chlorine- and brominc-
containing chemicals (halocarbons), particularly the
anthropogenic emissions of CFCs (WMO, 1992). The
computed ozone radiative forcings indicate that the
indirect chemical effects due to the halocarbons have
substantially reduced the radiative contributions of the
CFCs to the greenhouse forcing over the past decade
(WMO, 1992). Thus, the net greenhouse impact attributed
to the CFCs taken together, including the indirect as well
as direct contributions, may be significantly reduced
because of the halocarbon-induced destruction of ozone.

respects when compared to that due to the non-ozone
gases. First, although there is an approximate global mean
offset of the direct CFC forcing by the ozone losses
occurring during the 1979-1990 period, this arises because
of a significant negative forcing by ozone occurring only
in the middle to high latitudes, in particular the radiative
forcing due to increasing CFCs and decreasing ozone
ranges from a net positive one at low latitudes to a net
negative one at higher latitudes for the period considered
(WMO, 1992). Because of the spatial dependence of the
ozone losses and consequently the ozone forcing, the

available. In an investigation of the climatic effects due to
the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude ozone changes

Lacis et al. (1990) estimated a cooling of the surface at
those latitudes. One-dimensional globally- and annually-

loss of ozone in the lower stratosphere leads to a surface

It is emphasized that the ozone forcing is extremely
sensitive to the altitude of the losses (Ramanathan et al.,
1985; Lacis et al., 1990). There still is some uncertainty
regarding the exact profile and the magnitude of the loss in
the immediate vicinity of the tropopause. The SAGE
profiles are available globally only from ~17km and
above, and suggest an increasing percentage of loss with
decreasing altitude in the lower stratosphere. As an
illustration of this sensitivity, let us suppose that the losses
observed by TOMS are uniformly distributed through the
entire stratospheric column (see WMO, 1986). For this to
be the case, the principal ozone depletions would have to
occur at altitudes higher than observed over the past
decade, in which case a much smaller global ozone forcing
(-0.01 to -0.04Wm-2) would result. Thus, inferences about
ozone forcing depend crucially on both the total column

change as well as the change in the vertical profile.

there is no change in the dynamical heating of the

comparable in magnitude (~80%) but opposite in sign to
the decadal CFC greenhouse forcing (0.10 to 0.11Wm).
The globally-averaged ozone forcing is opposite in sign

Turning to the observed temperature trend (see Section
C3.3), the long-term temperature trends in the lower
stratosphere suggest a cooling. While this would be in
accord with the ozone-induced radiative cooling tendency
of the lower stratosphere (Lacis et al., 1990; WMO, 1992;
Miller ef a/., 1992) considerable difficulties remain in
attributing a part or all of the observed stratospheric
temperature trends to the ozone losses. Other physical
factors, such as possible changes in the physical state of
the troposphere, volcanic aerosols, change in stratospheric
circulation, ctc., which are not accounted for in the

The production of ozone depends on the concentrations
of NO, (WMO, 1992, Chapter 5). As the latter compounds
are short-lived, and their concentrations vary strongly in
the troposphere, ozone production is believed to vary
significantly throughout the troposphere. There is also an
in situ chemical loss of ozone in the troposphere in areas
where NO, concentrations are particularly low (less than
approximately 20 pptv). This occurs in the middle
troposphere and in remote oceanic areas where there are no
NO, sources (Liu et al., 1987). Ozonesonde measurements
reported in WMO (1992) indicate that ozone has incteased
by 1-1.5% per year in the free troposphere over Europe
during the last 20 to 25 years (Staehelin and Schmid,
1991). A similar trend in tropospheric ozone has
previously been reported for stations influenced by
regional air pollution (Logan, 1985; Bojkov, 1987;
Penkcett, 1988).

The radiative forcing due to increases in tropospheric
ozone has been investigated in earlier reports (WMO,
1986), Even though tropospheric ozone amounts are less
than in the stratosphere, their effective longwave optical
pathlength is comparable to that in the stratosphere
(Ramanathan and Dickinson, 1979), thus rendering them
radiatively important. In particular, the upper tropospheric
concentrations are most significant (Lacis ef al., 1990). A
10% uniform increase with height in the concentrations of
tropospheric ozone from current levels at 40°N (January
conditions) yields a positive radiative forcing of about
0.LWm-2 (WMO, 1992). Although the radiative effect of
increases in tropospheric ozone could be extremely
important in the greenhouse forcing of climate, there is, at
present, insufficient evidence that such increases are
actually taking place globally, especially in the radiatively
significant upper tropospheric regions. In the absence of
data from which meaningful giobal wrends can be derived,
it is not possible at this stage to quantify the current
contribution of tropospheric ozone to the global

Methane has an indirect effect through its oxidation in the

30% over its direct value in the absence of N,O
absorption-band overlap (see Table 2.2 in IPCC, 1990).
More recent modelling studies have shown that this
enhancement is highly uncertain. In WMO (1992) the
range is 22 to 38%, while Lelieveld and Crutzen (1992)
give a value of 5%. These differences may partly reflect
the different types of numerical experiment performed to

The most important new information that has become

sulphate aerosols. Based on simulations of the global

previously acquired information on scattering and

Acrosol particles influence the Earth’s radiative balance
directly by scattering and absorption of shortwave (solar)
radiation. An increase in concentrations of acrosol
particles will enhance this effect. Acrosol particles also
absorb and emit longwave (infrared) radiation, but this
effect is usually small because (a) the opacity of aerosols
decreases at longer wavelengths and (b) the aerosols are
most concentrated in the lower troposphere where the
atmospheric temperature, which governs emission, is
practically the same as the surface temperature (Coakley ert
al., 1983; Grassl, 1988).

"In the unperturbed atmosphere, the principal aerosol
constituents contributing to light scattering are sulphate
from biogenic gaseous sulphur compounds and organic
carbon from partial atmospheric oxidation of gaseous
biogenic organic compounds. Seasalt and windblown soil
dust contribute substantially at some locations but their
effect on the global climate is generally unimportant
because the particles are large and usually short-lived and
thus transported only short distances. Other acrosol
substances may also be locally and regionally important,
especially those that are sporadic such as from volcanoes,
wildfires, and windblown dust from deserts.

Submicrometre (diameter <10-m) anthropogenic
aerosols are produced in the atmosphere by chemical
reactions of primarily sulphur-, but also nitrogen- and
carbon-containing gases, predominantly sulphur dioxide.
These particles are efficient light scatterers, so changes in
them may alter the energy balance of the atmosphere. The
overall cffect also depends on changes in the amount of
energy absorbed. Light absorption is dominated by
particles containing elemental carbon produced by
incomplete combustion of carbonaccous fuel. The light
scattering effect is dominant at most latitudes, but
absorption might dominate at high latitude, especially over
highly reflective snow- or ice-covered surfaces (Blanchet,
1989). Over surfaces with low albedo (<0.1} characteristic
of most of the surtace of the Earth, anthropogenic aerosols
cool rather than warm the Earth (Coakley er al., 1983):
thus in global terms the scattering by sulphate should
dominate over absorption by elemental carbon.

Lean (1991). A 1% change in total irradiance is equivalent
to a radiative forcing of 2.4Wm-? at the top of the

could, if sustained for a number of years, noticeably affect
global climate and cither enhance or offset the effects of

The radiative effects due to these particles may be
already manifest in an observed warming of the lower
stratosphere (sec Section C4.2.4.2; also Labitzke and
McCormick, 1992). Radiative forcing calculations indicate
that these aerosols can also be expected to exert a
significant negative bul transient radiative forcing
(~0.5Wm- or more in magnitude) on the surface-
troposphere system over the next few years (Hansen ef al.,
1992). This is opposite in sign to the greenhouse gas-
induced forcing. General Circulation Model simulations
(Hansen er al., 1992) suggest that such an aerosol-induced
forcing could yield a temporary cooling tendency at the
surface and dominate the global surface temperature record
in the next year or more (see Section C4.2.4.2).

Observations over the past decade (lidar, satellite, balloon,
sunphotometer) indicate that the stratospheric aerosol
concentration throughout most of the 1980s remained
higher than that measured in 1979 (a relatively quiescent
period). This is probably largely attributable to the major
HE] Chichon volcanic eruption in 1982 together with the
effects of a few other minor eruptions (McCormick and
Trepte, 1987). Anthropogenic sources may have provided
an additional contribution (Hofmann, 1990). With the
recent major eruption of the Mt. Pinatubo volcano, there is
now a fresh accumulation of particulates in the
stratosphere (optical depth estimated to be between 0.1 and
0.3 one month after the eruption; M. P. McCormick,

It is clear that a better quantitative description of the
climate influence of anthropogenic aerosols is necessary in
models of past, present and future climate. Modelling
studies need to take into account sulphate acrosol
concentrations and their radiative influence as a function
of location and time as governed by emissions of sulphur
gases. To do this, models should accurately represent the
direct light scattering effect and also the influences of
these aerosols on cloud optical, radiative, and persistence
properties. At present, the influences on clouds in
particular cannot be estimated with confidence. Further,
there is only a meagre data base of observations with
which to validate the models of atmospheric chemistry,
transport and removal processes that are required to relate
acrosol concentrations to precursor emissions. There is,
similarly, little observational information on the
relationships between aerosol microphysical properties and
cloud microphysical properties, between aerosol and cloud
microphysical properties and their radiative properties, and
between cloud microphysical properties and cloud
persistence.
"	Text
"Because of the very different character of the forcing
due to aerosol sulphate as compared to that of the
greenhouse gases, no attempt is made here to define a
negative Global Warming Potential (GWP) for
anthropogenic sulphur emissions. In addition to the well-
known negative deleterious environmental effects of
sulphates - including acidification - there are several
reasons why increases in sulphur emissions cannot simply
be considered as trade-offs against reductions in
greenhouse gas emissions. Among these are: the very
different horizontal and vertical distributions of radiative
forcing due to sulphates compared with greenhouse gases,
the great uncertainty about their effects on clouds and the
subsequent effects on the climate system, and the fact that
the distribution of sulphates globally is largely inferred
from models rather than being directly measured.
Although in a global sense the negative forcing due to
acrosols may offset a substantial part of the positive
greenhouse forcing, the differences in spatial distribution
of greenhouse radiative forcing and acrosol effects mean
that increases in sulphates can never be expected to
compensate for the climatic effects of greenhouse gas
increases.

An entirely different approach has been used in a study
by Baliunas and Jastrow (1990) - see also Radick ef al.

irradiance associated with events like the Maunder

dated record of atmospheric radiocarbon measurements
shows that similar periods of prolonged sunspot minima
have occurred on many occasions during the past 8000
years (randomly spaced, but every 500 years on average).
It has been suggested that they correspond to periods of
lowered irradiance and global cooling (Hddy, 1976;

"In January 1989, the Response Strategies Working Group
(RSWG) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate

expert group to prepare a set of scenarios of global
emissions of carbon dioxide (CO,), methane (CH4),
nitrous oxide (NjO), halocarbons and the tropospheric
ozone precursors nitrogen oxide (NO,) and carbon
monoxide (CO) (IPCC, 1991a). These scenarios were
completed in December 1989 for use by the IPCC Science
Working Group (WGI) in its assessment of future climate
change (IPCC, 1990a and b). New information has become
available since the development of the original scenarios.
Consequently, in March 1991, the IPCC requested an
update of the existing scenarios in light of recent

"For completeness, several small sources of greenhouse
gases are added to this assessment which were not
included in the 1990 1PCC Assessment Report. These
include NjO from the production of nitric acid and adipic
acid, and CHy from animal wastes and domestic sewage
(see Sections Al.3 and A1.4). In addition, scientific
evidence described in Section A2 underscores the need to
consider the full range of gases which influence climate,
directly or indirectly. Cognizant of the importance of a
comprehensive approach, this Section also provides
preliminary estimates of present and future emissions of
volatile organic compounds (VOC) and sulphur oxides
(SO,). Their indirect influences on radiative forcing are
more uncertain than those of the direct greenhouse gases
and it is not yet possible to quantify on an equivalent basis
all the direct and indirect forcing. Improved information
with which both to estimate the emissions of these gases
and to summarize their effects is needed for future
assessments.

This Section first briefly compares the major
assumptions on population and economic growth with
historical data or other published forecasts. It then
summarizes how the original no-climate-policy Scenario A
(SA90) has been updated with information which has
become available in 1990 and 1991. This produces the new
IPCC Scenarios “IS92a” and “IS92b”. Because of
substantial uncertainty in how the future will evolve, this
Section also includes a preliminary assessment of a range
of additional no-climate-policy scenarios, as well as
comparisons with other published greenhouse gas
scenarios. The updated scenarios are set against two
studies of the probability distributions of possible CO,
scenarios, and then are compared to other published
“central tendency” scenarios that extend past the year 2000
and up to the year 2100. Finally, we present sector-by-
sector discussions of the particular methods and
assumptions in the update, along with additional sectoral
scenarios. Detailed documentation of the scenarios is
available in a supporting document which also provides
tabulations of key variables including population, GNP,
primary energy consumption, and emissions (Pepper er al.,
1992).

"A possibly important imitation of this analysis is that it
does not assess the effects that climate change may have
on agricultural production, energy demand, and terrestrial
ecosystems, Nor does it make assumptions about growth of
vegetation if CO, increases fertilization, or about losses of
the forest uptake of CO, if deforestation continues. There
could also be positive feedbacks on CO, and methane
emissions through increased respiration of vegetation and
degradation of organic soils. Also, as discussed in Section
A2 of this report, we do not yet have an adequate method
for summarizing on an equivalent basis the effects on
climate of all the greenhouse gases.

The assumptions for the scenarios in this report come
mostly from the published forecasts of major international
organizations or from published expert analyses. Most of
these have been subject to extensive review. The premises
for the 1992 [PCC Scenarios a and b (“IS92a” and
“IS92b”) most closcly update the SA90 scenario from
IPCC (1990) There exist a wide variety of other plausible
assumptions, some of which are used in the range of new
scenarios presented here. Table A3.1 summarizes the
different assumptions used in the six scenarios. These
assumptions are documented in detail in a supporting
report (Pepper et al., 1992),

demand for agricultural Land, method of forest clearing,
and the amount of biomass stored in the vegetation and
soils to estimate the clearing of tropical forests and the fate

"The Atmospheric Stabilization Framework (ASF),
developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA, 1990), was used as the primary tool for integrating
the assumptions and estimating future emissions of
greenhouse gases. The ASI‘ is a framework which
combines emission modules for various sectors including
modules for energy, industry, agriculture, forests and land
conversion, as well as a number of small sources. Each
module combines assumptions concerning population,
economic growth, structural change, resource availability,
and emission coefficients to estimate emissions in future
lime periods. The ASF estimates emissions for CO2, CHy,
N30, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and substitutes, CO,
NO,, VOCs, and SO,. The energy module uses energy
prices to equilibriate supply from the different energy
supply sources with demand in four energy end-use
sectors. Increased energy prices encourage additional
energy supply and increases in energy efficiency but have
only a small feedback on economic growth. The

New information since the SA90 has raised the assumed
population and economic growth rates compared to those
in the earlier assessment. The forecast of future population
growth in the SA90 came from the World Bank (Zachariah
and Vu, 1988), which the World Bank has since revised
(Bulatao ef al, 1989). The UN has also published new
population estimates (UN, 1990; UN Population Division,
1992). The UN medium case is very close to the World
Bank’s update; the UN medium-low and medium-high
cases are used in the alternative scenarios presented here.
Most of the variance between the medium-high and
medium-low cases is in the developing countries. The
updated World Bank population assumptions are close to
10% higher than the assumptions in the SA90: global
population increases from 4.84 billion in 1985, to 8.42
billion in 2025, and to 11.33 billion in 2100, with about
94% of the growth occurring in the developing countries.
The UN medium forccast of future population estimates
that global population may reach 8.51 billion in 2025, 1%
higher than the World Bank estimate. Their recent medium
extension of this suggests world population of 11.18
billion in 2100 (UN Population Division, 1992), or about
1% lower than the World Bank’s. The UN medium-low

is important to note that the emission results provided
in this paper are highly sensitive to both the population and
economic growth assumptions. These parameters would
most likely be negatively correlated, however. The
economic growth assumptions in 1$92a and b fall below
historical rates. It is uncertain whether ambitious growth
can be realized and maintained in all regions, especially
considering possible capital and resource constraints and
the presently volatile circumstances in a number of
nations. On the other hand, the relatively low GNP per
capita in developing countries cven at the end of the period
suggest that the [S92a and b assumptions fall well below
the aspirations of many countries.

Another scenario, IS92b, shows some of the uncertainty
surrounding these policics. 1S92b enlarges the inter-
pretation of current policies to include stated policies
beyond those legally adopted. All CO, commitments of
OECD countries, for example, are included, along with an
assumption of worldwide ratification and compliance with
the amended Montreal Protocol. Since we assume that the
CO, stabilization commitments would be achieved through
improvements in energy efficiency and switching from
fossil fucls to nuclear or renewable energy, this reduces
simultaneously some of the other greenhouse gases emitted
by fossil fuels. We assume that after the target years,
emissions would be kept level.

"[S92c, the lowest scenario, assumes the UN medium-
low population forecast, in which population declines in

promoting expansion of nuclear and renewable cnergy.

scenario. It extrapolates some possible trends towards
increasing environmental protection, but includes only
actions that could be taken due to concern about local or
regional air pollution. waste disposal, etc. Population
growth assumes the UN medium-low forecast and would
be associated with lower natality, falling below the

Long-term rates of decrease of exogenous end-use

year. Edmonds and Reilly (1985) explored the historical
rate of change of the energy to GNP ratio in a wide range

the energy to GNP ratio of 0.8% annually from 1880 to

year (Germany) to 1.33% per year (Italy). For three
centrally planned economies (the former USSR,
Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia) the rate of change was

The shares of different primary energy supplics change
dramatically in all of the scenarios due to assumed
limitations in fossil resources, expected advances in energy
technologies, as well as calculated increases in energy
prices. In [$92a and b, assumptions regarding available
conventional oil, natural gas liquids (NGL), and gas
resources are based on Masters ef al. (1991). At oil and gas
prices of $23 per barrel ($/bbl) and $2 per gigajoule
($/GJ), respectively, the available resource equals the
Masters et al. mean resource estimates. Additional
conventional resources, up to the Masters et al. 90%
bounding values, are available at prices rising to $35/bbi
for oil and $8/GJ for gas. As a result, in these scenarios,
conventional oil and gas production is gradually replaced
by unconventional fossil sources, by synthetic fuels from
coal, and non-fossil energy supplies. World oil prices
increase 10 $55/bbl by 2025 and up to $70/bbI by 2100. Up
to 760 billion barrels of unconventional Siquids including
heavy oils, bitumen, and enhanced oil recovery are
assumed to become available at oil prices of $35 to
$70/bb1. As conventional oil and gas are replaced with coal
and unconventional supplies, the production and
conversion losses tend to result in significant increases in
the rate of CO, emissions in [S92a. Large resources of
shale oi] are assumed to be available at prices over
$70/bbl. For the high fossil resource assumptions in IS92e

Grossling and Nielson (1985).

positive (direct) and negative (indirect) contributions to

halocarbons on globally averaged temperatures or, more
broadly, on climate is uncertain at present. As a result, the

tropical forest clearing increases to 28.6 million hectares in

almost all forest fallow is converted. In 18924, the

In conclusion, the sensitivity analysis explores a wide

several key assumptions. Figure A3.7 illustrates the CO,

A review of current land u uses, forest clearing, and
plantation assumptions suggests that the assumptions in the
new IPCC Scenarios are not inconsistent. FAO (1986)
reported that in 1984, 1.5 billion hectares were used for
arable land and permanent crops and 3.1 billion hectares
were used for permanent pasture leaving 4.1 billion
hectares of forest and woodlands. The moderate defor-

While these cases and sensitivities provide a plausible
range of emissions they do not address all of the
uncertainty. A key concern with these cases is consistency
of the assumptions about land uses among the different
sectors. Because the models and methodologies used for
the different sectors are not fully integrated with respect to
land use, this consistency is not automatically guaranteed.
With population doubling by 2100, improved nutrition in
the developing cconomies, and the agricultural land base
possibly degraded, the demand for additional land
conversion to produce crops especially in the developing
countries would be significant, even if sustained
productivity increases were achieved. Above, we already
noted the anticipated demand for land for livestock and
feed production, while the IS92a assumes over 190 EJ of
energy from commercial biofuels by 2100, of which 70%
would be in developing countries.

The 1992 Scenarios include emissions of additional gases
and emissions from additional sectors. Specifically,
emissions of N,O, CHy, CO, and NO, from cnergy
combustion and production were developed using
assumptions about emission controls consistent with the
US Clean Air Act and the Protocols under the Convention
on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution. In the base
year’s emission budget, our estimate of emissions of CO
from fossil fuels, by applying emission coefficients to fuel
use, falls below the low end of the range given in Section
Al of this report. Our estimate of emissions reflects the
latest data on energy consumption and emission
coefficients, but the CO budget discrepancics need to be

demand for food. The largest concern would be in Asia
where population densities are the highest and cleared
forest lands might not have the same productivity as
existing cropland, nor may the production be as

the potential land base and would have to be matched by

absence of new greenhouse gas reduction efforts, and the
types of change in important parameters which could or

Commitments by individual governments or companies to

significantly affect some of the individual emission

important information which has become available in 1990

balance very similar to the original SA90. The other

* The commitments by many OECD Member

in absolute terms or per capita, could have an
important impact on their own emissions but a small

Simulation of the climatic response to increases in
atmospheric greenhouse gases has continued to dominate
climate modelling. Preliminary results from new
integrations of coupled global atmosphere-ocean models
with progressive increases of CO, show that the patterns of
the transient response are similar to those in an equilibrium
response, except over the high-latitude southern occan and
northern North Atlantic ocean; here the delayed warming
has highlighted the critical role of the oecanic
thermohaline circulation. Computing limitations have
continued to restrict the resolution that can be used in
GCM simulations of the climate changes due to increased
greenhouse gases, although progress is being made in the
simulation of regional climate by both statistical
techniques and by locally nesting a higher-resolution
model within a global GCM.

Since the publication of the first IPCC Scientific
Assessment of Climate Change (IPCC, 1990) there have
been significant advances in many areas of climate
research as part of a continuing worldwide acceleration of
interest in the assessment of possible anthropogenic
climate changes. In this section we concentrate on
advances in the modelling of climate change due to
increased greenhouse gases, improvements in the analysis
of climate processes and feedbacks, and on advances in
climate model validation that were not available to the
IPCC in early 1990. This section is thus intended as an
update to selected portions of the 1990 assessment rather
than as a comprehensive revision, and an effort has been
made to keep the discussion both concise and focussed in
accordance with the stringent space limitations placed
upon this supplementary report.

The globally averaged annual mean increase of surface
air temperature at the time of effective CO, doubling (70
years for the GFDL and UKMO models, 60 years for the
MPI model with IPCC Scenario A, and 100 years for the
NCAR model) is between 1.3°C and 2.3°C. These values
are approximately 60% of the models’ equilibrium
warming (where known) with doubled CO, when run with
simple mixed-layer oceans. These results confirm those
from the simple models used in IPCC 1990. The lower

A summary of the new transient results is presented in
Table B1. Note that there are differences in the CO,
equivalent doubling times (by a factor of almost two) and
that the equilibrium sensitivity of the models is different.
The UKMO model has the finest horizontal resolution
while the MPT model has the finest vertical resolution in
the atmosphere and includes explicitly the radiative effects
of other trace gases. Three of the four coupled models (see
Table B1) use a correction or adjustment of the air-sea
fluxes so that the CO,-induced changes should be
interpreted as perturbations around a climate similar to that
presently observed. Adjustment of the fluxes also prevents
distortion of the CO, induced perturbation by rapid drift of
the model climate (since the same corrections are applied
to the control and anomaly simulations).

"GCMs is shown in Figure B1. In spite of the differences in
the models’ parametrizations and in their experimental
configurations, all of the models exhibit a number of
similar overall features in their response. Firstly, three of
the models show relatively little warming during the first
few decades of the integration rather than a constant rate of
warming throughout, despite the near constant rate of
increase in radiative heating. This so-called “cold start ” is
barely noticeable in the GFDL simulation, but in the
UKMO and MPI models the warming is negligible during
the first 2 to 3 decades. This phenomenon is thought to be
an artefact of the experimental design and can be
reproduced qualitatively using simplificd models
(Hasselmann et al., 1992; J.M. Murphy, personal
communication; see also Hansen et al., 1985) which
indicate that the length of delay grows with increasing
model sensitivity (the equilibrium warming for doubling
CO) and with effective heat capacity in the ocean. Until
this “cold start” phenomenon is investigated and
understood, it is not meaningful to match “model time”
with calendar dates. Secondly, as the increase in CO,
progresses, each model approximates a constant rate of
warming, in overall agreement with the 0.3°C/decade in
the IPCC (1990) projections made for the “business-as-
usual” CO, forcing scenario (A) with a simplified
upwelling-diffusion ocean model. Thirdly, all models
exhibit variability on intcrannual, decadal and even longer
time-scales, and some models reproduce ENSO-like
effects (Meehl,1990; Lau et al., 1991; J.F.B. Mitchell,
personal communication). The peak-to-trough range of
global surface air temperature intra-decadal natural
variability is 0.3 to 0.4°C (see, for example, Figure B2).

The’ ‘cold start” leads to a ‘a substantial delay in the
associated change in global sea level rise due to thermal
expansion (Figure B3), and is most pronounced in the
UKMO and MPI models. The rate of sea level rise
increases during the simulations to 2, 2.5 and 4cm/decade
by the time of CO, doubling in the MPI A (Scenario A),
UKMO and GFDL experiments, respectively. The
simulated rate of sea level rise at 2030 (the time of
doubling of CO3) due to thermal expansion (Scenario “A”

2.5cm/decade. Note that we have not reassessed the
contribution to sea level rise from changes in the snow and

been found by McGregor and Walsh (1991) with the
CSIRO model and by other groups (MPI, UKMO). The
application of the nesting approach to regional climate
changes in increased CO, experiments is not quite so
advanced, although Giorgi e7 al. (1991) have recently used
the NCAR doubled CO, simulation of Washington and

The main source of water vapour is evaporation over the
oceans, and humidities in the oceanic boundary layer are
close to saturation, with the concentration decreasing
rapidly with height. Both convective and large-scale

 

motions and the evaporation of precipitation help to
maintain the moisture distribution of the middle
troposphere (Betts, 1990; Pierrehumbert, 1991; Kelly e¢
al., 1991). The generally strong vertical gradients of water
vapour may, however, lead to systematic errors in models
with parametrized vertical moisture diffusion or coarse
vertical resolution. Consequently, the large-scale transport
of moisture must be treated carefully in GCMs lest
spurious sources and sinks of moisture occur (Rasch and
Williamson, 1990, 1991; Kiehl and Williamson, 1991).
Nevertheless, the overall realism of the outgoing clear-sky
radiative fluxes and of the simulated mean tropospheric
temperatures suggests that the models’ simulated
tropospheric water vapour concentrations are not greatly in
etror (Cess et al., 1990; Boer er al., 199 1a).

Observational data on the variation of cloud radiative

observations of Feigelson (1978) over the Soviet Union,

Cloud feedback due to changes in cloud amount and/or
distribution may be different, depending on whether clouds
are specified in terms of relative humidity or derived from
an explicit cloud water prognostic equation. Differences
may also arise from the differing treatment of clouds in
explicit cloud water schemes. For example, in the UKMO
model (Senior and Mitchell, 1992a) increasing the lifetime
of water cloud relative to ice cloud weakens the cloud
feedback (tending to reduce climate sensitivity), while in
the LMD model (Li and Le Treut, 1991) lowering the
temperature at which ice cloud forms strengthens the cloud
feedback. In the UKMO model the parametrization of
cloud properties (as a function of cloud water content)
apparently results in a modest positive contribution to the
total (cedback in the tropics due to increased infrared
longwave emissivilics. In the CCC model, on the other
hand, the parametrization of cloud properties (as a function

Using a methodology developed for an carlier study of
GCM cloud feedbacks (Cess e¢ al., 1990), a perpetual
April simulation was used with an imposed globally-
uniform SST perturbation of 2°C relative to a prescribed
climatological SST distribution. To isolate snow feedback,
two such April climate change simulations were
performed, one in which the snow cover was held fixed
and onc in which the snow line was allowed to retreat
following the imposition of the SST anomaly. The results
of these simulations are shown in Figure B1!8 in terms of
the climate feedback or sensitivity parameter 4 that was
defined in Section 3.3.1 of the IPCC (1990) report. (An

changes in snow cover as measured by the ratio A/A,
(where A, is the sensitivity parameter for fixed snow). Here

In general, clouds are thought to reduce positive snow
feedback by shiclding the TOA albedo change. This
mechanism, however, cannot account for the feedback sign
reversals or the cloud-induced amplification of positive
snow feedback exhibited by some models. As discussed by
Cess et al. (1991), the sign reversal in some cases is caused
by cloud redistribution, while in others it occurs as a
consequence of cloud-induced longwave interactions; there
is also a significant longwave feedback associated with
snow retreat in some models. These resulis are
complementary to those of Cohen and Rind (1991), who
found that the suppression of surface air temperature
changes by positive snow anomalies is considerably
reduced by a negative feedback involving the non-radiative
components of the surface energy budget.

Recent additional estimates of the climate sensitivity
have been made by fitting the observed temperature record
to the evolution of temperature produced by simple
energy-balance climate/upwelling-diffusion ocean models,
assuming that all the observed warming over the last
century or so was due solely to increases in greenhouse
gases (see [PCC (1990), Sections 6 and 8). Schlesinger ef
al. (1991) estimate a climate sensitivity of 2.2+0.8°C
allowing for the effect of sulphate acrosols, while Raper et
al, (1991) obtain a value of 2.3°C with a larger range of
uncertainty due to their allowance for natural variability
(see Wigley and Raper, 1990) and they estimate a value of
1.4°C with no aerosol effect. The effect of including
sulphates (or other factors that could act to oppose the
greenhouse warming) in such calculations is to increase
the estimated climate sensitivity, since the observed
climate warming is then ascribed to a reduced radiative
forcing (see Sections A2.6 and C4.2.4).

Uncertainties in the size of the surface albedo feedback
associated with sea-ice remain. As Ingram er al. (1989)
noted, estimates of the strength of feedback depend not
only on the model used, but also on the method used to
provide the estimate. Covey e7 al. (1991) estimated an
upper limit to sea-ice-albedo feedback by carrying out
simulations in which the albedo of sea-ice was changed to
that of the open ocean. They found an enhancement of
globally and annually averaged absorption of radiation of 2
to 3Wm-2, comparable to the change on doubling CO3.
They concluded that for a warming of the magnitude
expected on doubling CO, sea-ice-albedo feedback is
likely to be smaller than the feedback from water vapour
and potentially smaller than that from clouds. This is
consistent with Ingram ef af. (1989) who estimated a
feedback of 0.2-0.3Wm2K_! from sea-ice-albedo changes,
whereas estimates of the strength of water vapour feedback
are typically about 1.5Wm-°K-! (sec for example,
Mitchell, 1989). Mechl and Washington (1990) found that
changing their sea-ice albedo formulation to one which
was liable to induce ice melt led to both a warmer control
climate (about IK) and a greater sensitivity (about 0.5K) to
doubling CO. Further discussion of sea-ice modelling is
given in Section BS.4.

A dominant mode of atmospheric variability in the tropics
is that associated with tropical sea surface temperature
anomatics in the Pacific. These tropical ocean-global
atmosphere oscillations are called El Nifio-Southern
Oscillation, or ENSO. As noted in IPCC (1990),
almospheric models are capable of giving a realistic
simulation of the seasonal tropical atmospheric anomalies
al least for intense El Niiio periods if they are given a
satisfactory estimate of the anomalous sea surface
temperature (SST) in the tropical Pacific. This conclusion
is supported by more recent results (Kénig et al., 1990;
Kitoh, 1991; B. Hunt, personal communication). For
example, as illustrated in Figure B21, a rather good
simulation has been made of the observed interannual
variations of zonal surface wind stress over the central
equatorial Pacific and of the observed large-scale
interannual variations of sea-level pressure as represented
by the Southern Oscillation Index. Using prescribed sea
surface temperatures from 1987 and 1988, the broad
characteristics of monsoon interannual variability have
been reproduced (Palmer et al., 1991; Kitoh, 1992). Using
the coupled IAP model with observed initial conditions,

Latif et al. (1991) have successfully simulated interannual
variations that resemble some aspects of ENSO
phenomena, although the amplitude of the simulated SST
anomalies is generally less than that observed (as noted in
IPCC, 1990) and model resolution appears to have an
important influence on the simulated behaviour. Meeh!
(1990) claims some success in simulating ENSO-like
disturbances in a global low-resolution ocean-atiosphere
GCM, though it should be recalled that not all tropical SST
variations are associated with ENSO. As shown in Figure
B22, the patterns of tropical sea-level pressure changes
that are characteristic of ENSO in the present climate are
also present with doubled CO, (Meehl et al., 1991b). The
patterns of the tropical precipitation and soi}-moisture
anomalies are similar in the control and doubled CO,
cases, with the dry areas becoming gencrally drier and the
wet areas becoming generally wetter with increased CO).
These results, however, are yet to be confirmed with other
models. On increasing the concentration of greenhouse
gases in the MPI global coupled model, Lal e¢ al. (1992)
found no evidence for a significant change in the mean
onset date of the Indian Monsoon or for changes in the
precipitation in the monsoon region.

A great deal of interest has recently focussed on the
behaviour of the thermohaline circulation of the North
Atlantic, whereby North Atlantic deep water is formed.
This sinking is part of a global systein of ocean transports
known as the Conveyor Belt Circulation (Gordon, 1986).
Many aspects of the thermohaline circulation have been
simulated in a 1/2° global ocean model (Scmtner and
Chervin, 1991), and its basic dynamical structure and
sensilivity are being illuminated by both theoretical studies
and simulations with idealized models. In the present
climate, high-latitude winter cooling of relatively saline
surface watcr in the North Atlantic causes it to sink and
subsequently to move out of the basin by deep southward
currents; this flow is compensated by the northward flow
of warm surface water from the tropics, whose salinity
may be increased relative to the other high-latitude oceans
by enhanced evaporation (Stocker and Wright, 1991).

 
"	Text
"Wright, 1991).

The possibility of the natural collapse of the North
Atlantic thermohaline circulation has obvious implications
for our ability to predict future variations of the climate
system on decadal and longer time-scales. The North
Atlantic circulation, however, appears to be more robust to
change than the occan-only model results suggest. Atlantic
and Pacific deep sca sediment cores show that, with the
exception of a possible short interruption during the
Younger-Dryas event, no major break in the thermohaline
circulation has occurred since the end of the last ice age in
spite of the variability that has occurred in both the
atmosphere and ocean (see, for example, Keigwin er ail.,
1991). Preliminary results from a long integration of a
coupled ocean-atmosphere model (R. Stouffer, personal
communication) suggest that the thermohaline circulation
is more stable in a coupled model than in an ocean-only
model with restored SSTs.

"mesoscale eddies is reasonably well simulated, although
the eddy minima appear to be too low. The FRAM model
also shows a strong meridional (Deacon) cell in the
Antarctic Ocean, with a transport of over 20Sv. The
upwelling branch of this cell, which is seen in both high-
and low-resolution models, occurs at those latitudes where
the coupled ocean-atmosphere models show delayed
greenhouse gas warming (see Section B2.2). A recent
experiment by Béning and Budich (1991) has shown that
the simulated eddy energy increases substantially (along
with significant variability on time-scales of several years)
when the horizontal resolution is increased to 1/6"". This
raises the question (of practical importance for climate
modelling) whether or not mesoscale ocean eddies must be
resolved in climate calculations. Mesoscale effects are so
inhomogeneous and so tenvously connected to the larger-
scale currents that a simple parametrization of their effects
seems unlikely, However, studies using models that omit
salinity variations suggest that the total meridional heat
transport is only slightly influenced by eddies, since the
eddy flux tends to be compensated by a modification of the
mean flow induced by the eddies themsclves (Bryan,
1991). Further research on the climatic (as opposed to the
synoptic) role of ocean eddies is clearly required.

As shown with ocean-only models, variability on
decadal and longer time-scales is associated with the
advection of salinity anomalies through the deep
convection regions (Marotzke and Willebrand, 1991;
Weaver and Sarachik, 1991; Weaver et al., 1991;
Mikolajewicz and Maier-Reimer, 1990). In the GFDL
coupled model (R. Stouffer, personal communication)
similar variability on Ume-scales of order 50 years is
found. In an integration started from different initial
conditions, a GFDL model (Manabe and Stouffer, 1988) in
fact converged to a second equilibrium solution in which
the North Atlantic was both fresher and colder (as shown
in Figure B24) with a thermohaline circulation that was
weakly reversed. The existence of multiple equilibrium
states for the global ocean circulation raises the question of
their stability, ie., how easily the system may change from
one state to another. Maier-Reimer and Mikolajewicz
(1989) used the uncoupled MPI ocean GCM to investigate
the Younger-Dryas event and found that the North Adantic
thermohaline circulation was sensitive to relatively small
variations in the strength and location of the surface fresh
water input, such that a breakdown of the circulation could
occur within a few decades. Other recent experiments with
zonally averaged ocean models have demonstrated that
transitions between multiple equilibrium states can be
triggered by relatively modest changes in the large-scale
precipitation (Marotzke and Willebrand, 1991; Stocker and
Wright, 1991).

corresponding errors in the zonal wind distribution in
accordance with the thermal wind relationship, with the
result that most GCMs display too westerly a flow in the

Every climate modclling group strives to identify their

models’ systematic crrors as a natural part of the
continuing process of model development. Ideally, each
physical parametrization in a climate model should be
individually calibrated against appropriate observational
data, although in many (if not most) cases this is not
possible. Instead, with a particular set of parametrizations
and a particular resolution, a model’s performance is
evaluated against the available seasonal climatological
distributions of the large-scale variables such as
temperature and circulation. While atmospheric and
oceanic models continue to improve, the overall
characterization of their performance given in Section 4 of
IPCC (1990) remains valid (Gates ef al., 1990). The
situation is somewhat different, however, for coupled
atmosphere-ocean GCMs, for which only a provisional
error assessment is possible due to the limited number of
integrations that have been performed (see below and
Section B2.2) and because of the limited ocean data
currently available.

has recently been undertaken by TOGA-NEG (WCRP,
1990a; D. Anderson, personal communication), in which
several models have been integrated with the same
representation of surface forcing. In general, the SST error
in all models shows a similar pattern, with the central
equatorial Pacific being too cold and the equatorial
western Pacific too warm throughout the year. Water along
the western coast of South America is also generally too
warm, and the equatorial undercurrent tends to be too
weak. These discrepancies may be at least partly caused by

Although model intercomparison of the sort described
here does not address many important questions in climate
modelling (such as how to determine which parametriz-
ations are “best” or how best to couple the atmosphere and
ocean), intercomparison has proven useful as a collective
exploration of model parameter space and as a benchmark
for the documentation of model improvement. It is
characteristic of model intercomparisons that no single
model is found to be superior to all other models in all
respects. It should also be recognized that the various
intercomparisons are designed for different purposes: those
of Cess et al. (1990, 1991) are concerned with the models’
response to changes in forcing (and are therefore relevant
to the response to possible future changes of greenhouse
gases), while those of Boer ef al. (1991a) and those being
undertaken in AMIP (Gates, 1991) are concerned with the
models’ ability to simulate the present climate. As model
development continues (and as increased computer
resources become available), there will be both an

"For other variables such as cloudiness, precipitation,
evaporation, run-off, surface heat flux, surface stress,
ocean currents and sea-ice, however, the observational data
base remains inadequate for the purposes of model
validation. These variables are relatively difficult to
observe on a global basis, and are not easily inferred from
compilations of conventional circulation statistics such as
those of Oort (1983). The best prospect for their systematic
global estimation is probably the procedure known as re-
analysis, whereby modern data assimilation techniques are
used to retrospectively initialize a comprehensive
atmospheric GCM on a daily basis for a number of past
years. Such projects are being planned by both ECMWF
and NMC, and the possibility of applying the technique to
ocean models is under active consideration.

The availability of appropriate observational data is a
critical factor in the validation (and improvement) of
climate models, and some progress has been made in the
assembly of global data sets for selected climate variables.
The recent global compilations of average monthly surface
air temperature and precipitation by Legates and Willmott
(1990a, b) are believed to be improvements over earlier
atlases of these variables, and new assemblies of land-
based precipitation (Hulme, 1992) and soil moisture
(Vinnikov and Yeserkepova, 1991) are available. It should
also be noted that the diagnostics made from the
operational analyses of global numerical weather
prediction models (Hoskins et al., 1989; Trenberth and
Olson, 1988) are important sources of data for the
validation of selected aspects of atmospheric models, The
climatological ocean atlas of Levitus (1982) has been
supplemented by the compilation of surface variables from
the COADS data set (Wright, 1988; Oberhuber, 1988;
Michaud and Lin, 1991). These data are proving useful in
the validation of both ocean and coupled ocean-
atmosphere models, as are the observations of transient
tracers in the ocean (Toggweiler er al., 1989; Dixon ef al.,
1991),

"A study of one thousand years of tree-ring data (Cook et

summer temperature in Tasmania following a pronounced
cold period in the early 1900s, though the warming is still
within the range of natural climate variability experienced
over the past 1000 years. The strong twentieth century
warming is consistent with New Zealand tree ring
evidence (Norton et al., 1989) and large glacial retreats
there since 1860 (Salinger, 1990). However, no allowance
has been made in these and similar studies for the possible
fertilization effect of twentieth century increases in carbon

A recent study of documentary evidence in China
(Wang and Wang, 1991; Wang et al., 1991) reveals that
the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries were the coldest
periods there in the last S00 years (Figure Cla and 1b).
Finally, Briffa et ai. (1992) have expanded the analysis
presented in an earlier paper (Briffa et al., 1990) where
they use tree-ring data to reconstruct summer temperatures
for northern Fennoscandia since AD 500. Their new analysis
is designed to highlight greater than century time-scale
variability which was largely removed by the analysis
procedure they used previously. They find good evidence
in this region for a “Medieval Climatic Optimum” (S7, p
202) around 870-1110, another warm period around 1360-
1570, and a “Little Ice Age” (S7, p202) period around
1570-1750. Because of the pronounced multidecadal
temperature fluctuations in their data, Briffa et al. (1990)
suggest that greenhouse-gas-induced summer warming in
Fennoscandia might not be detectable until after AD 2030.

"We present a supplement to Section 7 (Folland e7 al.,
1990b - hereafter referred to as S7) “Observed Climate
Variations and Change” of the 1990 IPCC Scientific
Assessment (IPCC, 1990). It should be read in conjunction
with $7 to obtain a fuller discussion of observed climate
variations and changes. The main purpose of the
supplement is to introduce new findings and to update
important time-series and maps contained in S7 with
emphasis on large spatial scales and recent satellite
evidence. Consistent with this approach, most of the
references contained in Scction C are confined to those
published since 1989 or to those which are in press. Some
work on the detection and attribution of climate change is
also briefly reported, a subject previously contained in
Section 8 (S8) of the Scientific Assessment “Detection of
the Greenhouse Effect in the Observations” (Wigley and
Barnett, 1990). Although mainly discussed in Section A of
the present report, we also mention recent findings relevant
to interpretation of the climate record in terms of
“external” forcing factors like solar variations and
tropospheric and volcanic aerosols. Discussion of the
surtace cooling effect of recent lower stratospheric ozone
reductions is confined to Section A, as there is no unam-
biguous observational data available to confirm this.

Another revision, that removes a little of the
disagreement between Bottomlcy e¢ al. (1990) and Farmer
et al. (1989) data that was discussed in S7, is based on
further evidence that wooden buckets may have been in
predominant use at the beginning of the record. It is now
assumed that 100% of buckets were wooden in 1856, the
percentage linearly decreasing to 0% in 1920 (Folland and
Parker, 1992). This transition from wooden to canvas
buckets is nearly the same as that assumed by Farmer e¢ al.
(1989). However, since these authors assumed zero
corrections for wooden buckets, appreciable differences
between the two corrected data sets remain.

"Coe. ONip data

In S7 two Sea Surface Temperature (SST) analyses were
used: those of Bottomley ef al. (1990), up to 1989 and
those of Farmer e¢ al. (1989) up to 1986, the latter now
discussed in Jones et af. (1991). Here we show an updated
time-series that uses the Jones et ai. data and a new UK
Meteorological Office analysis to 1991. This new analysis
combines the Bottomley et ai. (1990) SST data base with
some Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set
(COADS) SST values. The COADS (Woodruff ef ai.,
1987) holds substantially more surface marine
observations than does the data base created by Bottomley
et al. (1990) but both sets contain unique data (Woodruff,
1990). The COADS were used to fill missing values in the
fields of monthly Bottomley et af. (1990) SST data, mostly
in the eastern half of the Pacific. Figure C3a shows the

Bottomley e7 al. (1990) data. The new data reflect a
substantial increase in coverage between the late 1870s

Office SST data coverage exceeds that of the COADS.
Improved instrumental corrections that use better models
of heat transfers affecting wooden and canvas buckets
have been used in the new UK Meteorological Office
analysis as discussed in Folland (1991) and Folland and
Parker (1992). The average magnitudes of these
corrections, which vary geographically, with season and
through time, are near 0.3°C (canvas buckets) and 0.1°C
(wooden buckets). Although these values are small
compared with the uncertainty in individual observations
(Trenberth ef al., 1992) they are important when calcu-
lating the averages of thousands or more observations.

Warming due to urbanization may still affect these
results but is probably not serious ($7, p 209). However, a
physically-based analysis of the urbanization problem is
still Jacking: a recently published simplificd physical
model of urbanization warming indicates that the problem
may be more complex than hitherto thought (Oke et a/.,
1991). Jones et al. (1990) have compared rural-station
temperature data sets over three large regions, European
parts of the Soviet Union, castern Australia and eastern
China, with widely used hemispheric data sets. When
combined with earlier analyses for the contiguous United
States, the regions are representative of about 20% of the
Jand area of the Northern Hemisphere and 10% of the
Southern Hemisphere and contain some of the most
heavily populated areas. They indicate that urbanization
influences have yielded, on average, a warming of less
than 0.05°C during the twenticth century over the global
land, The reasons tor this result are only partly understood
but, for the Jones data set, they indicate that the station-by-
station quality contro] procedures used were fairly
successful.

between the continuous and dashed curves shown in

Pacific data from the COADS in the late nineteenth
century to the Bottomley e¢ a/. (1990) values has slightly
increased the global average temperature in the UK

warmer then than the Jones et al. data, largely owing to the
positive wooden bucket corrections. Despite these

high correlation (r=0.94) between global, seasonally

mostly in the Southern Hemisphere. The UK data are
0.16°C (0.03°C) warmer in the Southern (Northern)
Hemisphere with a 0.85 (0.95) correlation of the seasonal
anomalics. These differences originate near ice edges
where they are much larger, and can be traced mainly to
the fact that the Reynolds and Marsico analysis fixes SS'T
at ice edges at -1.8°C, the average freezing point of sea
water, while the UK analysis does not do this. The effects
of this difference in methodology influence the analyses
for some distance from the ice edges. Despite the ditfer-

"Increased reports of the bleaching of coral rect's may
indicate higher SST values in many tropical regions over
the last decade. The health of the coral reefs widely found
through the shallow parts of tropical oceans is known to be
sensitive to a number of factors, one of which is sea
temperature in the top few tens of metres of the ocean
(D’Elia et af, 1991). Corals can tolerate a range of
temperature without damage, outside this range damage is
often exhibited as “bleaching”. Bleaching occurs when
green algac on which the coral depend are expelled from
the cells of the coral when the latter are stressed. The
tolerated temperature range varies with the species of
coral, different species being adapted to given local
conditions (ID’ Elia et al, 1991). Thus bleaching can be a
manifestation of a sea temperature that is extreme for the
locality. However, local high temperatures may act with
other stresses, such as pollution, to produce bleaching
(Roberts, 1991). Recently many coral reef scientists have

The causes and sizes of random errors in SST data have
been studied by Trenberth ef al. (1992) and Folland e¢ al.

ocean the signal of inter-monthly temperature variations is
inadequately resolved even on large spatial scales.
However, Folland et af. (1992) show that for seasonal
averages Over ocean basins, with the exception of areas
south of 40°S, the resolved climatic signal is at least twice
as great as the noise. For climate change and variability
studies, there is an urgent need to extend these results to
the annual, decadal, and century time-scales. “Frozen grid”
tests show that estimates of global SST anomalies are only
slightly more sensitive to changes in coverage than are the
combined SST and land data. The latter (see $7, Figure
710d) show a surprisingly low sensitivity to the large

difficulty of meaningfully calculating linear trends in these

Jones Northern and Southern Hemisphere land air
temperature records (Figures C2a and C2b) show a
statistically significant “abrupt” change in their average
values around 1920, though this may also reflect a rapid
change in trend evident at that time (Section C4.2.3). This
step-like character of the land-based temperature record
was noted earlier by Kelly er al. (1985). Returning to the

mainly be sought elsewhere. However, 1991 did contain a
pronounced El Nifio event. It is known that atmospheric
circulation anomalies played a part in 1990; a strong
westerly atmospheric circulation over the Northern

Eurasia in early 1990. Reduced snow cover (Section

especially in March 1990, which was by far the warmest

"C3.1,.3 Land and Sea Combined

Figures C4a-c show land data from the Jones analysis
combined with the average of SST data from the new UK
Meteorological Office analysis and the Jones et al. (1991)
SST analysis for the Northern Hemisphere, Southern
Hemisphere and globe respectively. The vertical bars are
annual values. The method of combining the land and
ocean data here is slightly different from that used in S7
(the latter is discussed in Folland, 1990). In Figures C4a-c
land and ocean values have been combined more
accurately and allow (approximately) for the relative areas
of land and sea in every analysed grid box for every
month. Figures C4a-c also show, as thinner lines, the
analyses published in S7, for comparison. Values in the
nineteenth century are very close to those shown in $7, and
probably indistinguishably different allowing for
uncertainties. The net effect of the changes is to make the
long-term warming trends assessed in each hemisphere
more nearly equal, with the Southern Hemisphere
relatively marginally warmer in the late nineteenth
century, especially around 1880, and the Northern
Hemisphere unchanged. Compared to values shown in S7,
larger differences in the last few years result from the
addition of the warm years 1990 and 1991. S7, p212, cited
increases of, or nominal linear trends in, temperature
between various periods over the last century and a very

Considering the most recent and warmest decade, the
sub-period 1986-1990 was warmer at the surface than
1981-85, though spatial patterns of temperature anomalies
were, in the annual average, similar for each 5-year period.
Positive anomalies in 1981-1990 were noticeably larger
during December to May than in the rest of the year in
both hemispheres (Figure C5). The El Nifio-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) had a clear effect on the interannual
variability of the global temperature, but does not explain
all the observed patterns nor the fact that 1986-90 was
warmer globally than 1981-1985, especially as 1986-1990
included the strong Pacific cold or “La Nina” event of
1988-1989. A cooling influence from the 1982 eruption of
Fl Chichon may have affected the first five year period,
though it is difficult to detect because of the strength of the
contemporaneous 1982-83 El Nifo.

exceeding 1°C over the high latitude Northern
Hemisphere continents, with centres over 2°C,
separated by notably negative anomalies over the
northwestern North Atlantic, including the area
around south Greenland, and also the mid-latitude
North Pacific. The USA shows negative anomalies
in the south, with positive anomalies near Canada.
Positive anomalies over the Antarctic Peninsula are
generally near 0.5°C. The global mean anomaly was
0.26°C (the most positive seasonal mean anomaly).
Mar-May - a broadly similar pattern but with a
smaller area of high latitude Northern Hemisphere

over North Africa. Positive anomalies over the
Antarctic Peninsula are stronger than in December to
February. USA anomalies are positive away from the
southern states, notably over the Rockies with values

Section 2 ($2: sub-section 2.3; Shine et ai., 1990) and
Section A of this report describe mechanisms for increases
of cloud cover, cloud albedo, and clear-sky albedo because
of observed increases in sulphate aerosol. If this were
occurring, there would likely be a preferential cooling
effect by day, possibly leading to a reduced diurnal range
in the Northern Hemisphere. This conclusion is consistent

"C3.1.5 Changes in the Diurnal Range of Temperature

S7 (p217) provided evidence that maximum temperatures
in the USA, south-eastern Australia and China remained
nearly stationary over the past several decades, but an
increase of minimum temperatures was quite apparent.
Karl er al. (1991b) have extended these time-series to
include the USSR and have updated the Chinese and USA
series (Figure C6). Over the last four decades, the results
indicate large increases of daily minimum temperatures
(0.1°C/decade) but little change of the daily maximum
temperatures. Karl e¢ al. (1991b) also found trends in
seasonal extremes of the maximum and minimum similar
to the changes of the mean maximum and minimum.
Preliminary analyses for Canada and Alaska give similar
results. It is unclear whether this phenomenon is global,
but it is certainly a characteristic of a substantial part of the
Northern Hemisphere record. However Mifsud (personal
communication) finds a notable increase in the diurnal
range in Malta over the last 60 years and Biicher and
Dessens (1991), while describing a marked decrease in the
diurnal range at 4 mountain-top station in the Pyrenecs,
also note that the mountain-top Sonnblick (Austria) record

does not show such a change.

As discussed in $7, p220, raingauges have tended to
underestimate precipitation, particularly snowfall (solid
precipitation). Legates and Willmott (1990) and Soviet
researchers (World Water Balance, 1978) have estimated
that global precipitation over land is on average
underestimated by 10% to 15%. Progressive improvements
to instrumentation have tried to remedy this and have
introduced artificial, systematic, increases in precipitation.
Recent efforts to automate measurements may again be
reversing this trend. Thus long-term variations and trends
should be interpreted cautiously.

"(p219). These have been updated, but no new conclusions
can be drawn. For example, precipitation over the Sahel
region of North Africa (Figure 7.16b of S7) has remained
well below the long-term average in 1990 and 1991
(Rowell ef al., 1992), extending the drought epoch there
into its third decade. Changes in rainfall in the Sahel have
been much larger than can be accounted for by
instrumental problems. The Sahel has experienced the
largest observed regional percentage change in
precipitation between the two thirty year periods 1931-60
and 1961-1990: a decline of 30% (Hulme er al., 1992). The
latter period includes the relatively moist 1960s (S7,
Figure 7.16b and Demarée and Nicolis, 1990), so the
“real” change in average since 1931-1960 may be larger.
The only other major region known to show a notable
long-term trend in precipitation is the USSR (Figure 7.16a
of $7). Area-averaged precipitation over the same region
(37°-70°N, 25°-140°E) has recently been revised to elim-
inate minor spurious trends and updated to 1990
(Groisman et al., 1991). Overall, the effects of these
corrections are small and the conclusion in $7 that there
has been a notable increase of precipitation over the USSR
south of 70°N during the last century is unaffected.

In $7, p220, a discussion was presented concerning the

tropical occans since 1974, based on an analysis of satellite
outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) data by Nitta and
Yamada (1989), with an opposing opinion expressed by
Arkin and Chelliah (1990). Chelliah and Arkin (1992)
have now shown that much of the decreasing trend in OLR
between 1974 and 1991, which appears to indicate an
increase of tropical oceanic rainfall, can be unambiguously
related to satellite instrumental factors rather than a real
OLR increase. Therefore an increase in rainfall over the

component in the increase of wind speed (Cardone ef al.,

should be reduced to between 65% and 50% of its apparent

increase in latent heat flux into the atmosphere between

"Following initial calculations that appeared to show an
increase of the evaporation rate from parts of the tropical
oceans between 1949 and 1979 (Flohn ef al., 1990a, b), a
revised analysis has been carried out to investigate the
sensitivity of the results to varying assumptions about the
reality of increasing near-surface wind speed over the
oceans (Flohn ef al., 1992). Figure C7a shows calculations
of the evaporation trend in the tropical oceans between
10°S and 14°N, expressed as a linear rate between 1949
and 1989. Only the main shipping lanes have been studied.
Ef it is assumed that the observed near-surface wind speed
trends should be reduced to 50% of their measured values
over the areas sampled, an average increase of about
18Wm- of heat input into the atmosphere is implied over
the belt as a whole. Calculations for sub-sections of the
zone (warmest oceans, upwelling regions and Atlantic
sector) give similar results.

An increase of tropical precipitation might be expected
to accompany increases in evaporation. However, the
results of Chelliah and Arkin (1992) discussed in Section

in the hydrological cycle in the last 10-20 years is
plausible, it is not proven. A rigorous analysis of the

eruption of Agung in 1963 (Newell, 1970). Inspection of

Although the radiosonde coverage is adequate from 1958
in the Northern Hemisphere, it is only complete enough in
the Southern Hemisphere since 1964, Global values can
therefore only be estimated since 1964, though Angell
used incomplete Southern Hemisphere data to extend his

adequate studies of possible time-varying biases in
radiosonde temperature data have not been made (Elliott

Angell analysis uses a different definition of the calendar
year from all other analyses in Section C, being based on
December-November. This will slightly reduce

climatic statistics over 1979-1987 with those from a
complete global data set provided by the European Centre

correlations between the two data sets were generally quite
high, but that root-mean-square errors for Angell’s

A particularly important aspect of MSU data in the

layers they measure, though the MSU record is still very
short (13 years). Figure C9 shows lightly smoothed

this short period very large, temporary but highly coherent

time-series of surface-based temperature anomalics and of

1985-87. Trenberth and Olson (1989) found a lower
stratospheric cooling trend in spring over the South Pole

though there were no tropospheric trends. In fact,
radiosonde data for 100-50 hPa for the south polar cap

last decade or more. However, in austral spring, when the
deepest ozone holes have been reported (SORG, 1991),
there have been very strong interannual fluctuations of
radiosonde and satellite Microwave Sounding Unit temp-

Although, as a result, the trend in Figure C8d is not

Low-pass filtered scries of 30 hPa temperature for
latitude belts of the Northern Hemisphere show weak
downward trends (Figure C8e, updated from Naujokat,
1981). At many latitudes there is a suggestion of an
oscillation almost in phase with the cycle of solar activity
whose length over this period was quite close to 11 ycars,
seen here in the solid curve for 20°N (see also Section
C4,2.1): this should be taken into account when 30 hPa
temperature trends are determined (van Loon and
Labitzke, 1990; Labitzke and van Loon, 1991, 1992).
Warming at 30 hPa associated with the 1982 eruption of F]
Chichon is especially noticeable at lower latitudes (e.g.,
the solid curve in Figure C8e). Data for late 1991 (not
shown in Figure C8e) show another pronounced warming
of up to several °C at 30 hPa. The warming, centred near
20°N and confined to regions south of 45°N, was almost
certainly due to the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in June 199).

$7 reported early results concerning recent tropospheric
temperature trends and interannual variations from a
valuable new data set derived from satellite measurements
of the microwave emission of radiation to space from
atmospheric oxygen (Spencer and Christy, 1990; Figure
7.17d, p221). The new technique, which uses data from the
Microwave Sounding Units (MSU) on the TIROS-N series

over layers of the atmosphere. Channel 2 data of the MSU
is weighted towards temperature over a substantial
thickness of the troposphere, but is also influenced by the
stratosphere and the character of the ground surface. By
using sets of Channel 2 data with different earth viewing-
angles it is possible to create a new data set called Channet
2R that is mostly (not completely) weighted towards levels
below 350 hPa, mainly to levels between 500 and 1000

between the MSU and the other data comes from
disagreements in the annual anomalies for 1979, L980 and

differences in the variables being measured and doubts

The sensitivity of the surface temperature to height-
dependent moisture changes was cxamined by Shine and
Sinha (1991) who point out the importance of changes in
water vapour content throughout the depth of the
troposphere. They show that changes in much of the mid-
troposphere are important as they tend to be large due to
the relatively great amounts of water vapour there.
However, despite the small absolute amount of water
vapour in the upper troposphere and stratosphere, they
show that changes at this level can also have a significant
effect on the radiation forcing of climate. Furthermore, an
increase in moisture in the stratosphere could lead to the
creation of further polar stratospheric clouds which have
an important effect on ozone depletion in the presence of
chlorine derived from chlorofluorocarbons. Stratospheric
water vapour is also important in the conversion of SO, to
sulphuric acid droplets which can cool surface climate
after a sulphur-rich volcanic eruption. Furthermore,

individual moisture patterns, have found an increase in
moisture in the tropics. At 850 hPa, this study found an
increase of specific humidity of around 10% between 1973
and 1986, though this value is very uncertain as the scatter
in the data is comparable to the trend and most of the

conclusive evidence for a worldwide recession of

among the clearest and best evidence for a change in
energy balance at the Earth’s surface since the end of the
last century. It provides sufficient support to the various
independent but far from perfect records of global temp-

In an examination of strategies for detecting green-
house gas signals, Barnett ef al. (1991) find tropospheric
moisture to be one of the most effective variables to
monitor. However, monitoring moisture presents many
difficultics and, since its variation is physically linked to
changes of temperature, it does not provide an independent
measure of greenhouse forcing. The residence time of
water vapour in the atmosphere is short, about 10 days, so
it is not well mixed. [f the water vapour in the air were all
condensed, the average depth of the condensate (the
precipitable water, PW), would be about 2.5cm. Above the
polar regions the mean PW is about 0.5cm, and above the
equatorial regions it averages about 5cm. Half the moisture
in the atmosphere lies between sea level and 850 hPa and
less than 10% resides above the 500 hPa level. Therefore,
observations at many places and levels are required to
adequately study changes in water vapour likely to be

The Northern Hemisphere snow extent anomaly time-
series shown in Figure 7.19 of $7 (p224) has recently been
revised. A change in analysis technique had resulted in
snow extents analysed prior to 1981 being slightly too
large relative to later values (Robinson et al., 1991). A
revised series from 1973 to 1991 is given in Figure Cil.
This still shows a modest decrease in snow cover since the
1970s but with a reduced magnitude: mean values over 3
years dropped by just over 2 million km? from the mid-
1970s to the end of the 1980s, about 8% of the total area.
In Figure 7,19 of S7, a decline of about 3 million km2 was
indicated. The new snow extent values have good support
from a parallel plot of extratropical Northern Hemispheric
land air temperature (Figure C11). The correlation between
the monthly (September to May only) anomalies of snow
cover and temperature is -0.41, but between unsmoothed
annual (average of Sept-May) anomalies it is -0.76 because
presumably influences other than those of temperature
partly cancel. Snow extent has been especially low in
spring since 1987, most notably in spring 1990. However,
the snow extent record is still much too short to distinguish
a possible greenhouse signal from natural variability.

Some of the techniques used to estimate the overall
glacier mass decrease in the Alps since the middle of the
nineteenth century are controversial. Recently, Haeberli
(1990) has estimated a 50% decrease in mass. Though this
is subject to marked uncertainty, a relatively large decrease
is likely. This drastic change is the consequence of an
upward shift in equilibrium line altitude by only 100m or
less. Twentieth-century melt rates of Alpine glaciers are an
order of magnitude greater than average melt rates at ihe
end of the last ice age (20,000 to 10,000 ycars ago).

In contrast to the above, high and middle latitude coastal
glaciers may grow under warmer and wetter conditions.
Mayo and March (1990) report that the Wolverine glacier
in the maritime region of southern Alaska near 60°N had
generally positive mass balances after 1976 as a result of
increased winter precipitation which fell as snow, despite
warmer winters, because temperatures remained well
below freezing. This change is likely to be associated with
the rather striking increase in winter half-year cyclonic
activity in the Gulf of Alaska since 1976 discussed in $7,
p229. In addition, Fitzharris ef a/, (1992) note that the
terminus of the Franz Josef glacier on the west coast of
New Zealand has advanced in the 1980s, as have other
alpine glaciers in New Zealand, despite the fact that the
1980s were locally one of the warmest decades in the
record. Atmospheric circulation changes partly associated
with ENSO appear to be involved.

However, this temporary re-advance has not affected the
larger glaciers. In further support of this conclusion two

from the 1950s to 1980s, Shi (1989) shows that 42% were

that the simulated global SST and a version of the

to a lack of sufficiently long time-series of satellite
measurements of solar irradiance, Reid’s conclusions rely
considerably on rocket- and balloon-borne measurements
of total solar irradiance made in the late 1960s; these are of
uncertain accuracy and representativeness. His conclusions
also depend on the reliability of the shape of the observed
global temperature series, especially prior to 1900 (Reid

A new approach by Friis- Christensen and Lassen (1991)
(FCL) uses the length of the sunspot cycle which is known
to be statistically related to solar activity. They hypoth-
esize that shorter cycles are directly related to higher solar
magnetic activity which in turn they assume corresponds
to a higher total output of solar radiation, though no firm
physical basis has been established for this relationship.
The length of the solar cycle varies between 7 and 17
years. After smoothing the cycle length data, they find a
correlation of -0.95 between cycle length and Northern
Hemisphere land surface air temperature since 1860 when
averages over corresponding solar cycles of these data sets
are compared. FCL do not compare their solar results with
a global surface temperature series because they prefer to
use temperatures over land which they assume are more
likely to be accurately determined than those over the sea.
They also find that shorter cycles (supposedly higher solar
radiation) correspond with less Icelandic sea-ice since
1740.

“Fingerprint” detection of the influence of an enhanced
greenhouse effect, by comparing the patterns of climate
change predicted by models with historical observations, is
fully discussed in S8. Progress is very difficult (a) because
multiple runs of coupled ocean-atmosphere models are
needed, requiring very large computer resources; (b) these
models may still not be adequate, particularly because of
the “flux correction problem” (see Section B2.2); (c)
adequate data series are very few and short; and (d) the
methodology to implement the technique has not fully
matured, In addition, the climate system can respond to
many forcings and it remains to be proved that the
greenhouse signal is sufficiently distinguishable from other
signals to be detected except as a gross increase in tropos-
pheric temperature that is so large that other explanations
are not likely (see $8). Because of these difficulties, no
definitive paper on detection has appeared since the 1990

In the past, many authors have claimed to largely
explain, in a statistical way, the hemispheric or global
temperature record in terms of a single forcing factor, but
different authors have chosen different factors. A full
discussion of such work and why different authors can
come to radically different conclusions appeats in Wigley
et al. (1986) and in $2. Recent examples are: (1) After
allowing for the influence of ENSO and a (different) index
of solar variability, Wu ef al. (1990) claim that the
variations of global and regional night marine air
temperature, and to a lesser extent SST, over the last
century published by Bottomley e¢ al. (1990) can be
mainly explained by an atmospheric turbidity index. This
index is claimed to relate mainly to the variations in
stratospheric dust due to volcanic activity, being based on
measurements made at 3100m altitude, but it might,
nevertheless, include some influence of tropospheric
aerosols as well (Section C4.2.4). (2) Schénwiese and

the mean has changed significantly (Demarée and Nicolis,

other of these hypotheses, but not both, so the conclusion
drawn can depend on the hypothesis that is chosen to be
tested and whether tests are chosen in advance of the
analysis of the data or subsequently (Karl, 1988). Never-
theless, some of these changes may have a real physical
cause and be of obvious importance, such as the rather

A renewed controversy has developed about the existence
of globally significant temperature variations on typically
18-22 year time-scales. These variations are often related
to the solar 22-year magnetic cycle (Newell! et al., 1989),
or sometimes to the 18-19 year lunar orbital cycles (Currie
and O’Brien, 1990) which can, in principle, have small
tidal effects on the oceans. Ghil and Vautard (1991) have
claimed to find a bi-decadal oscillation in global surface
air temperature using a novel form of analysis (singular
spectrum analysis), mirroring similar findings by Newell et
al, (1989) in global night marine air temperatures based on
more conventional techniques. However, Elsner and
Tsonis (1991b) show that the bi-decadal variation which

A full discussion of the relation between the historical
temperature record and different forcing factors requires
that greenhouse forcing be included (Kelly and Wigley,
1990; Hansen and Lacis, 1990). Although we do not know
what the response of the recent past climate to greenhouse
forcing has been, we do know the approximate magnitude
(2Wm’? at the top of the troposphere) and rate of increase
of the greenhouse-gas forcing over the last century (Figure
2.2 of 82, p55). Furthermore, empirical studies of
relationships between smoothed forcing factors and the
statistically non-stationary historical temperature record
cannat, alone, resolve the relative contributions of the
different forcing factors. The main problem lics in the
similarity of the trends of the forcing factors and the small
number of degrecs of statistical freedom in the data, which
often show long-term persistence. In addition, rigorous
statistical tools do not exist to show whether relationships
between statistically non-stationary data of this kind are
truly statistically significant, even though the correlations
found by each author between their chosen forcing factor
and the temperature record are invariably quite high
(Zwiers, personal communication). Thus a physical model
that includes both the hypothesized forcing and the
enhanced greenhouse forcing must be used to make further
progress.

now 10-15 times larger than the expected natural
concentration of sulphate (see Section A). The bulk of the
increase of SO, emissions began in the carly 1950s. As
stated in Section A, man-made, SO -derived acrosols are
important because they may have acted to retard the
expected warming from the build-up of greenhouse gases
and to produce a slower rale of warming in the Northern
Hemisphere (i.c., a relative cooling) compared with the
Southern Hemisphere. The approximately 1Wm-? negative

"C4.2.5 Changes in Land Surface Characteristics

Balling (L991) has pointed out that changes in the amount
of vegetation duc to man’s activitics can change temp-
eratures regionally. Thus, remova! of vegetalion, perhaps
leading eventually to desertification, tends lo raise near-
surface air temperatures, at least in warmer climates, as
more of the incoming solar radiation is used to heat the
ground and less is used to provide energy for the
transpiration of plants and trees. Such tendencies will be
offset by any accompanying increase in surface albedo,
and the net effect may depend on the character of the
initial vegetation as indicated by studies in Africa
(Wendler and Eaton, 1983), Balling contends that, if a
fraction of the observed global warming can be attributed
to man-made land-use changes, then less can be attributed
to the enhanced greenhouse effect. Conversely, such
effects need to be balanced against the local surface
cooling that is likely in areas where irrigation, new crop
growth and new lake surfaces have been developed in
recent decades.

"Figures C4a and b show that from about 1910 until the
1950s the Northern Hemisphere surface warmed with
respect to that of the Southern Hemisphere. This dif-
ferential warming, though consistent with some model
predictions of more warming in the Northern Hemisphere
compared with the Southern Hemisphere as greenhouse
gases are added to the atmosphere, is more likely to have
been of natural rather than man-made origin, in view of the
small increase of these gases over that period. Krom the
1950s until about 1980, however, the surface of the
Southern Hemisphere warmed relative to that of the
Northern Hemisphere by nearly 0.3°C (Table Cl). The
timing of the reversal of relative warming might suggest
that sulphate acrosols have been a contributory cause, but
renewed warming of the Northern relative to the Southern
Hemisphere in the last few years (Figure C4) shows how
uncertain such conclusions can be. There is, however,
evidence of a reduction in sulphate aerosol emissions from
Western Europe since 1980 (Smith, 1991) which could
have contributed to renewed warming in the Northern
Hemisphere. These results do not prove the hypothesis of a
significant aerosol cooling effect on the observed climate
because the likely signal is still only of a magnitude
similar to the natural variability (Wigley, 1989; Wigley e
al., 1992). Many other variables, such as cloudiness
changes and ocean circulation variations involving the
North Atlantic (S7, Section 7.7), may lead to natural
differences between hemispheric temperature trends.

"eruption of the Chilean volcano Cerro Hudson was at least
10 times smaller than that of Pinatubo in terms of the
amount of SO, emitted into the stratosphere, but was still
about twice as large as that of Mt. St Helens in 1980
(Doiron et al., 1992). Mt. Pinatubo may have placed nearly
3 times as much material into the stratosphere as did the
strong El Chichon eruption of 1982 (Bluth et af, 1992).
However, Stowe ef al. (1992), using a different technique,
have estimated that the Pinatubo eruption may have placed
a little less than twice as much material there. It is
provisionally estimated that this sulphur-rich eruption,
which is the type currently thought to have the maximum
climatic effects, will temporarily reduce global mean
surface temperature by 0.3°-0.5°C over the next year or so
(Stowe et al., 1992). The upper end of this estimate is
indicated by modcl simulations carried out by Hansen et
al. (1992) of the possible effect of Pinatubo stratospheric
aerosols on global land temperature, assuming that the
aerosols contain twice as much sulphur as did those of El
Chichon. If this cooling happens, the consequences of the
Pinatubo eruption, with a small extra contribution from
Cerro Hudson, could dominate the global surface
temperature record in 1992 or a little beyond. In response
to heating of the aerosols, globally averaged lower
stratospheric temperatures measured by MSU Channel 4
rose by about 1.3°C between June and October 1991, but
then began to decline (Figure C9), MSU mid-tropospheric
temperatures fell by over 0.5°C between June 1991 and
December 1991, though such decreases are common in the
record (Spencer and Christy, 1990).

geneilies, needs much more scrutiny. Recent in situ and
remotely-sensed data need to be optimally blended and
made consistent with historical records; this may allow a
nearly full global coverage of several data sets for the last
decade or more. Heterogencitics in operational analyses of
the atmosphere reveal the urgent need for their “re-

the mechanisms of climate change and variability to be

The main conclusions of $7 concerning the reality,
character and magnitude of global and hemispheric
warming over the last century remain unaffected by recent
evidence. The most challenging result of recent research is
probably the increasingly widespread evidence, though not
yet conclusive in a globally-averaged sense, of a marked
decrease in the diurnal range of temperature over land
largely produced by rising minimum temperatures (Section
3.1.5). Is this the result, perhaps partly through increases
in cloudiness, of an important anthropogenic effect related
to increasing tropospheric aerosols and are increases in
greenhouse gases making a contribution? Wider inves-
tigations of the response of the diurnal temperature cycle
in general circulation models to these effects, differ-
entiated into clear-sky and cloudy conditions, would be

very desirable.

In the future, remote sensing data must be much more
extensively used in climate change studies. However, to
achieve the potential of satellite data for studying climate
change, the development of methods to ensure
homogeneity of processed remote sensing data with
historic data will be essential. The satellites, to be truly
useful, must provide continual coverage and cfforts must
be made to sustain their calibration over very long periods.
In this context, the proposals for a Global Climate

meantime, surface data from developing countries and
from marine archives need to be rescued, qualily-
controlled and added to existing analyses. Finally,

The largest radiative forcing is produced by 1S92e and f
(Figure Ax.1). CFCs are phased out more rapidly in IS92e,
giving slightly less forcing early in the century, but larger
increases in CO, emissions later on result in larger forcing
in I$92e. Of the middle scenarios (IS92a and b), IS92a has
slightly greater CO) emissions, while CFCs are phased out
faster in IS92b, so the forcing is larger in 1892a
throughout. In the low scenarios (IS92c and d), CFCs are
phased out rapidly in IS92d carly on, giving smaller
forcing, but large reductions in CO emissions in [S92c
later on reverse the order of the magnitudes of forcing in
the latter half of the century.

"For the 1990 IPCC Scientific Assessment (IPCC, 1990),
IPCC Working Group III developed four scenarios of
future emissions of greenhouse gases. These were used by
Working Group I to produce estimates of the resulting rate
and magnitude of climate change, represented by the
global average surface temperature. In the current report,
six revised emissions scenarios (referred to as [S92a-f)
have been described (see Section A3). The purpose of this
Annex is to present calculations of the temperature rise
consequent on these new scenarios and to compare IS92a
with the IPCC 1990 Scenario A (SA90) using the same
assumptions as those used in IPCC (1990).

The calculations are performed using a one-dimensional
climate model and a series of gas cycle models that relate
emissions to concentration changes (STUGE, Wigley et
al., 1991). The climate model is essentially the same as the
model used by IPCC (1990) and it reproduces their results
well. For instance, using SA90 with a climate sensitivity of
2.5°C, IPCC 1990 found a warming of 3.3°C over the
period 1990-2100 (see IPCC, 1990, Figure A.9). For the
same scenario, the model gives the same figure to within
0.1°C. The gas cycle models simulate well the IPCC
(1990) concentration projections (which were obtained by
averaging the results from a number of different modcls)
for the full range of emission scenarios considered by
IPCC (1990).

Two point should be noted concerning the emissions
scenarios as they are entered into the model. Firstly, the
model fixes the 1990 emissions in cach case to accord with
the values used in IPCC (1990) . These figures do not
agree with those in IS92, this causes an inevitable
discrepancy between the intended emissions and the
figures actually used for 1990-1995 (for the halocarbons)
or 1990-2000 (for the other gases). Secondly, the current
version of the model requires scenarios to be specified as
figures at a certain number of fixed times, and linear
interpolation is performed between them. Thus the points
used by the model do not all correspond to those used. in
the scenarios, leading to small differences in some cases
because of discrepancies in the periods of linear
interpolation.

The inputs to the model are the projected emissions of
carbon dioxide (CO), methane (CH,), nitrous oxide (N,O)
and the halocarbons CFC-11, CFC-12 and HCFC-22. CO,
emissions are converted to concentrations using a simple
carbon cycle model, developed by parametrizing results
from an ocean circulation model including a carbon cycle.
CH, concentrations are obtained from a mass balance with
exponential decay terms representing atmospheric
destruction and the soil sink. ‘The lifetime for the former
process is made to depend on CHy concentration and CO,
emissions. NO and halocarbons, however, are treated as
having constant decay times. Note that we have not
updated the atmospheric lifetimes of CFC-11 (65 years),
CFC-12 (130 years) and CH, to the later estimates given in
Section A3.

"The time-series of radiative forcing is then applied to an
upwelling-diffusion energy-~balance climate model.
Essentially, this comprises an oceanic mixed-layer coupled
to a vertical water column in which heat is transported by
diffusion and advection. The model is one-dimensional,
but the presence of land masses is accounted for by
having separate, zero-heat-capacity boxes for land in cach
hemisphere. The response of the climate system to the
changes in radiative forcing is principally determined by
the climate sensilivily, normally quoted as the equilibrium
global mean temperature change expected for a doubling
of atmospheric CO}. In the model, this parameter accounts
for all ways in which the mixed-layer loses heat except for
the flux into the deep ocean. Climate feedbacks are not
explicitly modelled but their effects are accounted for by
the choice of a range of values of the climate sensitivity.
Three different values were used, namely 1.5°C, 2.5°C (the
{PCC (1990) “best-estimate”) and 4.5°C. For these and the
other parameters of the model (depth of the mixed-layer,
ocean thermal diffusivity, rate of upwelling and
temperature response of polar sinking water) the same
values were chosen as in IPCC (1990).

ft is also instructive to compare [S92a with SA90. The
concentrations of CO, and N,O are similar (Figures Ax.4
and Ax.5) but CH, concentrations are slightly higher in the
1990 Scenario. The difference in forcing due to these gases
is about 0.4Wm-? (Figure Ax.6). However, the concen-
trations of HCFC grow much more rapidly in the SA90
case, and the concentrations of CFCs increase whereas in
1892a they decrease (Figure Ax.7) giving a difference of
about 0.7Wm? in radiative forcing (Figure Ax.8). Thus the
forcing is about 15% less in IS92a (Figure Ax.9), giving a
slightly smaller warming (Figure Ax.10),

"REVIEWERS OF THE IPCC WGI REPORT
"	Title
"The persons named below all contributed to the peer review of the IPCC Working Group I 1992 Supplement and its
supporting scientific evidence. Whilst every attempt was made by the Lead Authors to incorporate their comments, in
some cases these formed a minority opinion which could not be reconciled with the larger consensus. Therefore, there
may be persons below who still have points of disagreement with areas of the Report.
