"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was
jointly established by the World Meteorological Organization
(WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme
(UNEP) in 1988 to: (i) assess available information on the
science, the impacts, and the economics of, and the options for
mitigating and/or adapting to, climate change and (ii) provide,
on request, scientific/technical/socio-economic advice to the
Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Since
then the IPCC has produced a series of Assessment Reports,
Special Reports, Technical Papers, methodologies, and other
products that have become standard works of reference, widely
used by policymakers, scientists, and other experts.

"This Special Report was prepared following a request from
the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the
Parties to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the
Ozone Layer. The state of understanding of the relevant science
of the atmosphere, aviation technology, and socio-economic
issues associated with mitigation options is assessed and reported
for both subsonic and supersonic fleets. The potential effects
that aviation has had in the past and may have in the future on
both stratospheric ozone depletion and global climate change
are covered; environmental impacts of aviation at the local
scale, however, are not addressed. The report synthesizes the
findings to identify and characterize options for mitigating
future impacts.

"Following a request from the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO) to assess the consequences of greenhouse
gas emissions from aircraft engines, the IPCC at its Twelfth
Session (Mexico City, 11-13 September 1996) decided to produce
this Special Report, Aviation and the Global Atmosphere, in
collaboration with the Scientific Assessment Panel to the
Montreal Protocol. The task was initially a joint responsibility
between IPCC Working Groups I and II but, following a
change in the terms of reference of the Working Groups
(Thirteenth Session of the IPCC, Maldives, 22 and 25-28
September 1997), the responsibility was transferred to IPCC
Working Groups I and III, with administrative support remaining
with the Technical Support Units of Working Groups | and IL.

"The report considers all the gases and particles emitted by aircraft
into the upper atmosphere and the role that they play in modifying
the chemical properties of the atmosphere and initiating the
formation of condensation trails (contrails) and cirrus clouds.
The report then considers (a) how the radiative properties of
the atmosphere can be modified as a result, possibly leading to
climate change, and (b) how the ozone layer could be modified,
leading to changes in ultraviolet radiation reaching the Earth’s
surface. The report also considers how potential changes in
aircraft technology, air transport operations, and the institutional,
regulatory, and economic framework might affect emissions in
the future. The report does not deal with the effects of engine
emissions on local air quality near the surface.

"Although it is less than 100 years since the first powered flight,
the aviation industry has undergone rapid growth and has
become an integral and vital part of modern society. In the
absence of policy intervention, the growth is likely to continue.
It is therefore highly relevant to consider the current and
possible future effects of aircraft engine emissions on the
atmosphere. A unique aspect of this report is the integral
involvement of technical experts from the aviation industry,
including airlines, and airframe and engine manufacturers,
alongside atmospheric scientists. This involvement has been
critical in producing what we believe is the most comprehensive
assessment available to date of the effects of aviation on the
global atmosphere. Although this Special Report is the first
IPCC report to consider a particular industrial subsector, other
sectors equally deserve study.

"The global mean climate change is reasonably well represented
by the global average radiative forcing, for example, when
evaluating the contributions of aviation to the rise in globally
averaged temperature or sea level. However, because some of
aviation’s key contributions to radiative forcing are located
mainly in the northern mid-latitudes, the regional climate
response may differ from that derived from a global mean
radiative forcing. The impact of aircraft on regional climate
could be important, but has not been assessed in this report.

times the average Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate.
Freight traffic, approximately 80% of which is carried by
passenger airplanes, has also grown over the same time period.
The rate of growth of passenger traffic has slowed to about 5%
in 1997 as the industry is maturing. Total aviation emissions
have increased, because increased demand for air transport has
outpaced the reductions in specific emissions} from the continuing
improvements in technology and operational procedures.
Passenger traffic, assuming unconstrained demand, is projected to
grow at rates in excess of GDP for the period assessed in this report.

"Ozone is a greenhouse gas. It also shields the surface of the
Earth from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and is a com-
mon air pollutant. Aircraft-emitted NO, participates in ozone
chemistry. Subsonic aircraft fly in the upper troposphere and
lower stratosphere (at altitudes of about 9 to 13 km), whereas
supersonic aircraft cruise several kilometres higher (at about 17
to 20 km) in the stratosphere. Ozone in the upper troposphere
and lower stratosphere is expected to increase in response to
NO, increases and methane is expected to decrease. At higher
altitudes, increases in NO, lead to decreases in the stratospheric
ozone layer. Ozone precursor (NO,) residence times in these
regions increase with altitude, and hence perturbations to
ozone by aircraft depend on the altitude of NO, injection and
vary from regional in scale in the troposphere to global in scale
in the stratosphere.

"The climate impacts of the gases and particles emitted and
formed as a result of aviation are more difficult to quantify than
the emissions; however, they can be compared to each other
and to climate effects from other sectors by using the concept
of radiative forcing.4 Because carbon dioxide has a long
atmospheric residence time (~100 years) and so becomes well
mixed throughout the atmosphere, the effects of its emissions
from aircraft are indistinguishable from the same quantity of
carbon dioxide emitted by any other source. The other gases
(e.g., NO,, SO,, water vapour) and particles have shorter
atmospheric residence times and remain concentrated near
flight routes, mainly in the northern mid-latitudes. These
emissions can lead to radiative forcing that is regionally located
near the flight routes for some components (e.g., ozone and
contrails) in contrast to emissions that are globally mixed (e.g.,
carbon dioxide and methane).

"Increases in greenhouse gas concentrations since pre-industrial times (i.e., since about 1750) have led to a positive
radiative forcing of climate, tending to warm the surface of the Earth and produce other changes of climate.

The atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide (N,O),
among others, have grown significantly: by about 30, 145, and 15%, respectively (values for 1992). These trends
can be attributed largely to human activities, mostly fossil fuel use, land-use change, and agriculture.

Many greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for a long time (for carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, many
decades to centuries). As a result of this, if carbon dioxide emissions were maintained at near current (1994)
levels, they would lead to a nearly constant rate of increase in atmospheric concentrations for at least two centuries,
reaching about 500 ppmvy (approximately twice the pre-industrial concentration of 280 ppmv) by the end of the
21st century.

Tropospheric aerosols resulting from combustion of fossil fuels, biomass burning, and other sources have led to a
negative radiative forcing, which, while focused in particular regions and subcontinental areas, can have continental
to hemispheric effects on climate patterns. In contrast to the long-lived greenhouse gases, anthropogenic aerosols
are very short-lived in the atmosphere; hence, their radiative forcing adjusts rapidly to increases or decreases in
emissions.

Our ability from the observed climate record to quantify the human influence on global climate is currently limited
because the expected signal is still emerging from the noise of natural variability, and because there are uncertainties
in key factors. These include the magnitude and patterns of long-term natural variability and the time-evolving
pattern of forcing by, and response to, changes in concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols, and land-surface
changes. Nevertheless, the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate.
The IPCC has developed a range of scenarios, IS92a-f, for future greenhouse gas and aerosol precursor emissions
based on assumptions concerning population and economic growth, land use, technological changes, energy
availability, and fuel mix during the period 1990 to 2100. Through understanding of the global carbon cycle and
of atmospheric chemistry, these emissions can be used to project atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases
and aerosols and the perturbation of natural radiative forcing. Climate models can then be used to develop projections
of future climate.

Estimates of the rise in global average surface air temperature by 2100 relative to 1990 for the IS92 scenarios
range from | to 3.5°C. In all cases the average rate of warming would probably be greater than any seen in the
last 10 000 years. Regional temperature changes could differ substantially from the global mean and the actual
annual to decadal changes would include considerable natural variability. A general warming is expected to lead
to an increase in the occurrence of extremely hot days and a decrease in the occurrence of extremely cold days.
Average sea level is expected to rise as a result of thermal expansion of the oceans and melting of glaciers and
ice-sheets. Estimates of the sea level rise by 2100 relative to 1990 for the IS92 scenarios range from 15 to 95 cm.
Warmer temperatures will lead to a more vigorous hydrological cycle; this translates into prospects for more
severe droughts and/or floods in some places and less severe droughts and/or floods in other places. Several models

"the longer the time horizon the more uncertain these scenarios
become. The aircraft emissions scenarios developed here used
the economic growth and population assumptions found in the
IS92 scenario range (see Table | and Figure 1). In the following
sections, scenario Fal is utilized to illustrate the possible
effects of aircraft and is called the reference scenario. Its
assumptions are linked to those of IS92a. The other aircraft
emissions scenarios were built from a range of economic and
population projections from IS92a-e. These scenarios represent
a range of plausible growth for aviation and provide a basis for
sensitivity analysis for climate modeling. However, the high

"Aircraft emissions of NO, are more effective at producing
ozone in the upper troposphere than an equivalent amount of
emission at the surface. Also increases in ozone in the upper
troposphere are more effective at increasing radiative forcing
than increases at lower altitudes. Due to these increases the
calculated total ozone column in northern mid-latitudes is
projected to grow by approximately 0.4 and 1.2% in 1992 and
2050, respectively. However, aircraft sulfur and water emissions
in the stratosphere tend to deplete ozone, partially offsetting
the NO,-induced ozone increases. The degree to which this
occurs is, as yet, not quantified. Therefore, the impact of
subsonic aircraft emissions on stratospheric ozone requires
further evaluation. The largest increases in ozone concentration
due to aircraft emissions are calculated to occur near the
tropopause where natural variability is high. Such changes are
not apparent from observations at this time.

"In 1992, aircraft line-shaped contrails are estimated to cover
about 0.1% of the Earth’s surface on an annually averaged
basis with larger regional values. Contrails tend to warm the
Earth’s surface, similar to thin high clouds. The contrail cover
is projected to grow to 0.5% by 2050 in the reference scenario
(Fal), at a rate which is faster than the rate of growth in aviation
fuel consumption. This faster growth in contrail cover is
expected because air traffic will increase mainly in the upper
troposphere where contrails form preferentially, and may also
occur as a result of improvements in aircraft fuel efficiency.
Contrails are triggered from the water vapour emitted by air-
craft and their optical properties depend on the particles emit-
ted or formed in the aircraft plume and on the ambient atmos-
pheric conditions. The radiative effect of contrails depends on
their optical properties and global cover, both of which are
uncertain. Contrails have been observed as line-shaped clouds

the formation of persistent contrails. Increases in cirrus cloud
cover (beyond those identified as line-shaped contrails) are
found to be positively correlated with aircraft emissions in a
limited number of studies. About 30% of the Earth is covered
with cirrus cloud. On average an increase in cirrus cloud cover
tends to warm the surface of the Earth. An estimate for aircraft-
induced cirrus cover for the late 1990s ranges from 0 to 0.2%
of the surface of the Earth. For the Fal scenario, this may
possibly increase by a factor of 4 (0 to 0.8%) by 2050; however,
the mechanisms associated with increases in cirrus cover are
not well understood and need further investigation.

aerosol accumulation will grow with aviation fuel use, aerosol
mass concentrations from aircraft in 2050 are projected to
remain small compared to surface sources. Increases in soot
tend to warm while increases in sulfate tend to cool the Earth’s
surface. The direct radiative forcing of sulfate and soot aerosols
from aircraft is small compared to those of other aircraft
emissions. Because aerosols influence the formation of clouds,
the accumulation of aerosols from aircraft may play a role in
enhanced cloud formation and change the radiative properties

estimate of the radiative forcing in 1992 by aircraft is 0.05 Wm?

global climate change of aviation (or any other sector with
similar radiative forcing) from all other anthropogenic activities.

the projected change of —1.3% for Fal. Flying higher leads to
larger ozone column decreases, while flying lower leads to
smaller ozone column decreases and may even result in an
ozone column increase for flight in the lowermost stratosphere.
In addition, emissions from supersonic aircraft in the Northern
Hemisphere stratosphere may be transported to the Southern
Hemisphere where they cause ozone depletion.

—2.6%). For comparison, the calculated change in the erythemal
dose rate due to changes in the concentrations of trace species,
other than those from aircraft, between 1970 to 2050 at 45°N is
about —3%, a decrease that is the net result of two opposing
effects: (1) the incomplete recovery of stratospheric ozone to 1970
levels because of the persistence of long-lived halogen-containing
compounds, and (2) increases in projected surface emissions of
shorter lived pollutants that produce ozone in the troposphere.

"Ozone, most of which resides in the stratosphere, provides a
shield against solar ultraviolet radiation. The erythemal dose
rate, defined as UV irradiance weighted according to how
effectively it causes sunburn, is estimated to be decreased by
aircraft in 1992 by about 0.5% at 45°N in July. For comparison,
the calculated increase in the erythemal dose rate due to
observed ozone depletion is about 4% over the period 1970 to
1992 at 45°N in July.? The net effect of subsonic aircraft
appears to be an increase in column ozone and a decrease in
UV radiation, which is mainly due to aircraft NO, emissions.
Much smaller changes in UV radiation are associated with
aircraft contrails, aerosols, and induced cloudiness. In the
Southern Hemisphere, the calculated effects of aircraft emission
on the erythemal dose rate are about a factor of 4 lower than for
the Northern Hemisphere.

"One possibility for the future is the development of a fleet of
second generation supersonic, high speed civil transport
(HSCT) aircraft, although there is considerable uncertainty
whether any such fleet will be developed. These supersonic
aircraft are projected to cruise at an altitude of about 19 km,
about 8 km higher than subsonic aircraft, and to emit carbon
dioxide, water vapour, NO,, SO,, and soot into the stratos-
phere. NO,, water vapour, and SO, from supersonic aircraft
emissions all contribute to changes in stratospheric ozone. The
radiative forcing of civil supersonic aircraft is estimated to be
about a factor of 5 larger than that of the displaced subsonic
aircraft in the FalH scenario. The calculated radiative forcing
of supersonic aircraft depends on the treatment of water vapour
and ozone in models. This effect is difficult to simulate in
current models and so is highly uncertain.
"	Text
"Scenario FalH considers the addition of a fleet of civil
supersonic aircraft that was assumed to begin operation in the
year 2015 and grow to a maximum of | 000 aircraft by the year
2040. For reference, the civil subsonic fleet at the end of the
year 1997 contained approximately 12 000 aircraft. In this
scenario, the aircraft are designed to cruise at Mach 2.4, and
new technologies are assumed that maintain emissions of 5 g
NO, per kg fuel (lower than today’s civil supersonic aircraft
which have emissions of about 22 g NO, per kg fuel). These
supersonic aircraft are assumed to replace part of the subsonic
fleet (11%, in terms of emissions in scenario Fal). Supersonic
aircraft consume more than twice the fuel per passenger-km
compared to subsonic aircraft. By the year 2050, the combined
fleet (scenario FalH) is projected to add a further 0.08 Wm?
(42%) to the 0.19 Wm radiative forcing from scenario
Fal (see Figure 4). Most of this additional forcing is due to
accumulation of stratospheric water vapour.
